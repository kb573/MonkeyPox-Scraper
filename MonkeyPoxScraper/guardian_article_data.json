There have been more than 2,600 cases of monkeypox in the UK so far, which in the majority of the cases affects gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The US on Thursday declared a public health emergency over the virus, which followed the World  Health  Organization (WHO) last month calling it a global emergency. UK health authorities have urged calm, but now groups in Westminster have called on the health secretary, Steve Barclay, to take action due to monkeypox “causing real fear and anxiety”. “We are united as LGBT+ groups from across political parties in asking that the government treat the monkeypox outbreak as a public health emergency,” a letter to Barclay signed by the LGBTQ+ groups for the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Scottish National party said. “We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.” The letter, which was also signed by sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the government must prioritise communication and vaccination. “We need clear, non-stigmatising messaging, delivered direct to GBMSM about the symptoms of monkeypox and what to do if you suspect you have the virus to inform and reassure people (rather than the current broadcast-to-all approach that constantly mentions GBMSM),” the authors, who included the Tories’ Luke Black and Matthew Lloyd of Labour, stated. “Messaging must reach communities at high risk of acquiring monkeypox, through targeted messaging on apps, online and in the queer media. Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK,” they added. “We are very worried that, while mass vaccination events are a great way of building confidence that vaccinations are happening, they can be a driver of inequality, especially when there is an under-supply of jabs,” Lloyd said separately. “It is time to get improved systems and more purchasing of this much-needed vaccine.” The Terrence Higgins Trust also called for improvements to the vaccination effort. The charity’s head of policy, Ceri Smith, said: “We need urgent political action to get a grip on the UK’s rapidly rising number of monkeypox cases. “That’s why we’re grateful to the LGBT+ groups from the different political parties uniting to call for a public health response that’s proportionate to the size of the problem while gay and bisexual men continue to make up the vast majority of cases. “We need to see far better coordination, increased vaccine procurement, improved delivery and a cash injection to sexual health services to treat monkeypox that will also reverse the impact the outbreak is already having on STI testing and treatment, PrEP provision and contraception services.” The NHS announced late last month that it was stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab became available. Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Thousands of monkeypox vaccines have already been administered and the NHS is working to rapidly invite those at greatest risk. We have procured over 150,000 vaccines, and we’re working with partners – including the NHS and UK Health Security Agency – to share targeted, non-stigmatising communications with the LGBTQ+ community. “We are enabling local authorities to invest in essential frontline sexual health services by providing more than £3.4bn through the public health grant.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox"},
{"title": "Monkeypox showing signs of plateauing in UK, say health officials", "author": "Geneva Abdul", "date": "Sat 6 Aug 2022 13.28 BST", "text": "The monkeypox outbreak in the UK is showing signs of plateauing, the UK  Health  Security Agency has said.  The organisation said there had been 2,859 confirmed and highly probable cases of the viral disease as of 4 August, the majority of which are transmitted between men who have sex with men. Despite recent figures suggesting the outbreak has slowed, the agency’s director said “we cannot be complacent”. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice,” said Meera Chand, the director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA. Within England, the majority of cases have been in London. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK is 37, and 99% of all UK cases are male. The smallpox vaccine is being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox, according to the agency, in efforts to protect individuals and reduce the spread of the disease. Last month a vaccination drive was launched as sexual health campaigners warned health authorities were underestimating the scale of the response required to stop monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK. As cases surpassed 2,000, public health officials ordered 100,000 more doses of vaccine. The news of UK cases plateauing comes as parts of the  US brace  for the viral disease, where it has already been  declared a public health emergency  by the president, Joe Biden, after New York City, San Francisco and other cities announced a state of emergency. The global monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern  by the World Health Organization  (WHO) last month. It was the seventh time such a declaration has been made since 2009, the most recent being for Covid-19. The WHO later advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/monkeypox-showing-signs-plateauing-uk-health-officials"},
{"title": "Gay community braces for monkeypox as outbreak spreads in US", "author": "Eric Berger", "date": "Fri 5 Aug 2022 10.00 BST", "text": "Earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, members of the gay and bisexual men’s social group  Prime Timers St Louis , were “very, very worried” about Covid-19 because of underlying health conditions, said Bob Brinkman, 69, president of the group. That includes HIV, among other issues that compromised their immune systems. But the group’s 141 members got vaccinated against Covid, he said, and in June, Prime Timers held its monthly potluck for the first time in more than two years. Now the gay community in St Louis and elsewhere in the US have another health threat to worry about: monkeypox, a viral disease that has primarily affected men who have sex with men – but can infect anyone – and caused New York,  California  and Illinois to declare a public health emergency. Other cities and states across the US are bracing and preparing for its impact also, both within the LGBTQ community and more broadly. On Thursday the White House declared monkeypox a national public health emergency, triggering more resources especially around vaccines. “It will have a continual impact on my intimate side of life,” said Brinkman, who lives in a St Louis suburb and is retired after working in information technology. “I don’t have anybody in my life right now, and to try to meet somebody on that level, it raises a big concern, and I think a lot of people are thinking about that too.” But while infectious disease experts urge men who have sex with men in cities, like St Louis, not yet hit hard by monkeypox to educate themselves on the disease, they also warn against panic, an understandable reaction for a demographic that was torn apart by the Aids epidemic. “I think it would be safe to say that this could be stressful for individuals, on top of two and a half years of incredible stress,” said Dr Preeti Malani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Michigan. “People should be worried but not to the point where they are not able to move forward with their lives.” The virus can cause fever, headaches and a painful rash, among other symptoms, but is rarely fatal. It’s primarily spread through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, such as during sex,  according to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The United States had recorded more than 6,300 cases of monkeypox by Wednesday, almost half of which have occurred in New York, California and Illinois,  according to  the CDC. But most states have reported fewer than 100 cases.  Missouri  has reported 10. Cities such as St Louis “should be prepared to see infections transmitted among men who have sex with men and then eventually spilling over into other social networks as well”, Jay Varma, the director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response, said. “It’s very hard to say whether or not this will be large outbreaks or whether it might be just a few cases.” That will depend on the availability of vaccines and the effectiveness of testing and contact tracing efforts, Varma said. There is only enough vaccine supply in the United States to cover about a third of the estimated 1.6 million gay and bisexual men whom officials consider at highest risk, and the shortage could last for months, the Washington Post reported . To promote vaccination and information on the virus, Malani said, public health agencies should collaborate with trusted community organizations such as the University of Michigan’s Spectrum Center, which in 1971 became the first office for queer students at a US university. The group now works with the school’s public health department and the county health agency and is preparing messaging for when students return later this month, Malani said. “That’s an example of going to the organizations, the grassroots, the community centers, the individuals who have clout and are visible and are good partners,” said Malani. Public health officials should also use “non-traditional locations” such as bars, restaurants and bathhouses to provide information about the virus. On Monday afternoon, a steady stream of customers entered Club St Louis, which is part of a chain of private men’s saunas. On its website  homepage , the company offers advisories regarding Covid and monkeypox. “The first step in controlling MONKEYPOX is to seek out as many cases as possible, learn how the disease is transmitted, and what the symptoms are,” the alert states. “It’s important to get treatment for those infected and to vaccinate those who are potentially exposed, and to ensure that our at-risk community knows what is happening.” David Williams, a 49-year-old hairdresser, and a friend visiting from out of town came to the pool. “Apparently gay men are the only ones having sex any more in America,” Williams joked of the virus’s primary spread. Williams, who is HIV positive but protected from transmitting the virus because of medication, had already received a monkeypox vaccine from a county health department in  Illinois . Still, when asked whether the threat of monkeypox had caused him to change his lifestyle, Williams, who is divorced and single, said, “absolutely”. “No sex,” he said. “Until more people get vaccinated.” But the message from public health officials to gay men should not be, “Just don’t have sex,” Varma said. “Whenever we talk about sex, we as healthcare providers always need to recognize that sex has health benefits, and it brings joy to people’s lives,” said Varma. “That said, you also need to be realistic and honest about where risk is right now. And at the moment … the highest risk is from either anonymous sex partners and/or sex-related events where people are having sex with multiple partners, so it is wise for men who have sex with men to be thinking about what their risk tolerance is.” AJ Pupillo, a 45-year-old St Louis county resident who acts as a caretaker for his parents, had not yet given much thought to monkeypox. Pupillo, who is HIV positive but also cannot transmit the virus, said he trusted Vivent Health, an HIV treatment organization with an office in St Louis, to provide  information  and care he could need regarding monkeypox. “I know I’m in good hands,” said Pupillo. Brinkman, the president of Prime Timers, said the organization would probably continue gathering because monkeypox is much less contagious and is spread differently than Covid. “It might have some affect,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s going to force us back to Zoom.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/monkeypox-outbreak-us-gay-community"},
{"title": "Rightwing media embraces Aids-era homophobia in monkeypox coverage", "author": "Wilfred Chan", "date": "Wed 10 Aug 2022 11.00 BST", "text": "openly mock monkeypox victims This aggressive stigmatization of monkeypox – reminiscent of the homophobic response to HIV/Aids in the 1980s – poses a serious challenge to public health advocates and community leaders trying to have honest conversations about the disease with the gay and bisexual men who are most at risk during the current outbreak. Should public messaging highlight the fact that monkeypox is primarily affecting men who have sex with men? And should public health bodies urge gay men to change their sexual practices? The simultaneous threats of homophobia and monkeypox require making a difficult choice about which to tackle first, says the writer and veteran Aids activist  Mark S King , a 61-year-old gay man. “I’m about killing the alligator closest to the boat. And right now that means getting information to men who have sex with men about how to avoid this.” Early in the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) struck a cautious note in its communications about monkeypox, which causes painful lesions, fever, and other symptoms. On 18 May, the agency said that “cases include individuals who self-identify as men who have sex with men” while stressing “anyone, regardless of sexual orientation” could spread the disease. But an  international study  published on 21 July found 98% of recent Monkeypox cases outside of Africa were found in gay or bisexual men, with transmission suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of those cases. That’s why King is aligned with an increasing number of US public health officials and advocates who believe the messaging around monkeypox needs to be brutally honest in communicating the risks to the population most affected – even if homophobes are going to pounce on it. Last week, the CDC  appointed  Dr Demetre Dasklakis, a gay man and renowned Aids activist, as the deputy coordinator of its national monkeypox response. Days later, the agency published  guidance  for preventing monkeypox through safer sex that includes an illustration of two men in a bed. The article recommended people limit their number of sex partners, avoid anonymous hookups, and “wash your hands, fetish gear, sex toys” after having sex. It also suggested socially distanced or video masturbation as alternatives to sex. Sex-positive public health messages like these have drawn scorn from conservative commentators. “Chastity. Celibacy. Modesty. Disciplined. Not being gross. Keeping your legs closed. All viable options, people,” tweeted the Republican commentator Kathy Barnette in response to the CDC’s guidance. “Still waiting for gay men who are having random sex with strangers during the  Monkeypox  outbreak to get lectured and scolded by public health authorities the way that the rest of us did for going to grocery stores and restaurants during Covid,” tweeted the Daily Caller’s Matt Walsh. And in late July, Fox News’s Tucker Carlson tweeted a poll declaring that the disease should be renamed “schlong Covid”, tagging the CDC. But King says these rightwing attacks are just a distraction. “We have to ignore that if we are to deliver an effective public message to the community that we care about.” King contracted HIV in 1985 and remembers feeling frustrated over the lack of official acknowledgment of the toll on gay men. “How many years was it until our president said how many people died of Aids, before there was detailed, explicit language on how the virus was transmitted?” he says. “Fast forward to 2022, where we are at least getting all of this great, explicit information out about monkeypox so that gay men can protect themselves. I consider that progress.” But not everyone in the queer community agrees on how to talk about the new outbreak. The prominent rights group Glaad has notably cautioned against framing monkeypox as a disease that primarily affects men who have sex with men in  guidance  issued to the media.  Framing monkeypox as a disease within the gay community will discourage other people from educating themselves on prevention, says DaShawn Usher, the director of communities of color and media at Glaad. “If history has shown us anything, it would show us that a communicable disease like this doesn’t stay within one community,” he said. “Stigma drives fear, and fear then becomes resistance to public health and stopping the spread of the disease.” Usher says the belief that monkeypox only affects some people might also discourage employers from offering accommodations for monkeypox, or prevent workers from disclosing that they have monkeypox for fear of being labeled or outed as queer. There is also disagreement within the queer community about whether and how to discuss changing sexual behavior during the outbreak. Some health authorities’ suggestions that affected communities scale back their sexual activity while the US grapples with  vaccine delays  can sound uncomfortably similar to conservative attacks on gay culture. Usher says that just telling people to abstain from sex would send the wrong message. “You could still contract monkeypox if you were to kiss someone that had an active case of monkeypox, or if you cuddled with someone without clothes on. I would just encourage people to understand all of the ways that it could be spread.” King says he has received pushback within his community for telling others to consider dialing back their hookups. “I’m getting attacked by people who think that I’m contributing to the stigmatization of gay sex. My response to that is: you’re welcome to go back to whatever kind of sexuality suits you in a few weeks. The vaccines are on the truck. Give it a minute.” The activist believes the best way to offer frank public health advice about sex is to remove any moral judgment. “We’ve learned through the last 40 years of HIV that moral judgments only help HIV,” he says. “Moral judgments shame the people who are most at risk, which leads to people going underground, not admitting what their behaviors are, and not wanting to talk about the risks.” That’s not to say there isn’t room to discuss why gay men make the choices they do, King says. “But right now it is a completely worthless conversation when it comes to stopping the spread of monkeypox.” King says it’s a mistake to think that avoiding the realities of monkeypox will reduce homophobic aggression – which has been increasing for many years. The number of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes reported have risen substantially over the last decade, federal hate crime statistics show. During that period, US state legislatures have passed an unprecedented number of anti-LGBTQ+ measures, with 2021 deemed the “worst year” ever by the  Human Rights Campaign . Many US schools have  banned LGBTQ+ books , and  attacks on queer spaces  are on the rise. In recent months, rightwing activists have stoked fears by promoting conspiracy myths that queer-friendly people are “ grooming ” children for sexual abuse. “Those people tracking down queer men to bash, they have a pocket full of hatred on any number of issues that will lead them to pick up that beer bottle,” King says. “They might have new language to use while they’re bashing us over the head, but they would still be bashing us over the head.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/monkeypox-homophobia-lgbtq-rightwing"},
{"title": "Monkeypox vaccine: what’s available in Australia, and who should get it?", "author": "Melissa Davey", "date": "Thu 4 Aug 2022 05.42 BST", "text": "On 28 July Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance”. This means disease spread is serious enough that national policy, interventions and public messaging is needed to combat it, along with more resources. It follows the World Health Organization declaring  the spread of monkeypox a global health emergency  earlier in July. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there have been 20,311 monkeypox cases in 71 countries, including Australia, that have not seen monkeypox spread before. Here’s what we know about the vaccines and who should get vaccinated in Australia. On 4 August, the  Australian government announced it had bought 450,000 doses of the third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine , the first 22,000 of which were due to arrive within two weeks. That vaccine would be prioritised for at-risk groups including men who have sex with men – especially those travelling to countries with a significant outbreak – sex workers, and immunisation providers who are administering the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine.  The ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine is also registered for use in Australiaand protects against monkeypox, but as it uses a weakened live pox virus it is not suitable for immunocompromised people. Supply of this vaccine is available to states and territories through the national medical stockpile. It hasn’t been widely used, since smallpox has been eradicated. With  more than 70 countries now affected by monkeypox outbreaks , this newer vaccine is in short supply globally.  The older ACAM2000 vaccine is made from a virus called vaccinia, which is a type of pox virus related to smallpox and monkeypox, but which does not cause either disease, and which is also much milder than both viruses. Administering the vaccine requires special training. The skin is repeatedly scratched with a needle dipped into the vaccine. The virus begins to grow at the injection site, causing a red, itchy sore spot, or a “pock” in the days afterwards. It then eventually blisters and scabs over, and may leave a small scar. The vaccine stimulates the immune system to develop antibodies that can then help the body recognise and then fight an infection if exposure to monkeypox occurs. There is a risk that the vaccinia virus can be transmitted from the wound site to their close contacts. Those who are severely immunocompromised, who are pregnant, or who have eczema are most at risk, and can suffer serious adverse events either from being vaccinated or exposed to someone who has been. The risk of transmission from a vaccinated person to other people can be reduced by covering the injection site and good hygiene. The site is only infectious until scabbed over. The newer vaccine, known as Jynneos in Australia, does not carry the same risk and can be used in immunocompromised people and is also safe for pregnant women, children, and those with skin conditions. It is administered more easily, given in two doses four weeks apart, though people already vaccinated against smallpox in the past may only need one dose. It has fewer side effects than ACAM2000, and doesn’t require the same aftercare precautions. On 28 July Kelly announced the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) had made recommendations around how this newer vaccine should be used so that health workers are ready to administer it once supply is available in Australia. Kelly did not say when he expects the vaccine to be widely available, and Atagi advice states only that “limited supplies … have been secured by the Commonwealth and some states and territories,” though it is unclear if it has arrived in Australia yet. Most healthy people recover from monkeypox within a few weeks, experiencing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. In some cases, monkeypox may begin with a rash or sores in the mouth and on the face, which may then spread to other parts of the body. Severe illness and death is a risk in rare cases, particularly in immunocompromised people. ACAM2000 does protect against monkeypox. But according to Atagi, Jynneos is the preferred vaccine for these vulnerable groups, and it is also the preferred vaccine for use in people exposed to the virus and at risk of developing disease. Vaccination after exposure can prevent disease developing, known as post-exposure prophylaxis. Atagi advice states that “For healthy non-pregnant adults, where Jynneos is not suitable or not available, ACAM2000 has an established profile and may be considered” for those exposed to the virus or at high risk of exposure. The good news is monkeypox does not spread easily between people. You need close contact with the lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets through extended face-to-face contact with an infected person to be at risk. With a low number of cases in Australia, contact tracing is straightforward and infection risk is lower, but  high-risk communities especially are on alert . Until at least the end of November, monkeypox is a notifiable disease in Australia, which means health authorities must be told of every case. In Atagi advice updated late July, the key risk groups recommended for vaccination include anyone who is a high risk monkeypox close contact within the past 14 days. High risk groups include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have a high number of sexual contacts are at the highest risk of monkeypox infection. Those living with HIV, a recent history of multiple sexual partners, participating in group sex, or attending sex on premises venues may also be considered for vaccination, the advice states. Those taking HIV prevention medication due to having a number of sexual partners may also be recommended for vaccination. Atagi states that sex workers, particularly those whose clients are in high-risk categories, and anyone in risk category planning travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, should also have vaccination recommended to them between four-to-six weeks prior to departure. Healthcare workers who will be administering ACAM200 can be offered either vaccine if they have not previously received a smallpox vaccine. Healthcare workers who will only be administering the Jynneos vaccine and otherwise have no anticipated occupational exposure to monkeypox are not routinely recommended for smallpox vaccination. For those health workers who have already received a smallpox vaccine in the past, a booster dose is recommended if the previous dose of a smallpox vaccine was given more than ten years prior. Vaccination is also being offered on a case-by-case basis to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, such as household contacts and health workers. “Vaccination within four days of first exposure to an infectious case will provide the highest likelihood of prevention of disease,” Atagi says. A systematic review  published in 2019 suggests that protection offered against smallpox virus  may last more than 20 years after vaccination. A  separate small study  found protection may last 35 years or longer. It is hoped protection against monkeypox would last similarly. According to Atagi: “Childhood smallpox vaccination may confer a longer lasting immune response than vaccination during adulthood, however this is uncertain. Those who have previously received a smallpox vaccine are likely to have some residual protection.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/monkeypox-vaccine-australia-can-you-get-it-and-who-should-eligibility-side-effects-what-available"},

The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said Monday’s declaration would help the state coordinate a government-wide response, seek more vaccines and lead outreach and education efforts on where people can get treatment and vaccines. California, the nation’s most populous state, follows in the footsteps of similar declarations issued by  New York  and  San Francisco . There are currently more than 5,800 cases of monkeypox in the US, according  to the CDC , and public health agencies, left battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, have faced criticism  for being too slow  to act. The World Health Organization recently declared monkeypox a  global health emergency .   The outbreak has far has been disproportionately  affected  gay and bisexual men and reopened old traumas for those who lived through the HIV/Aids crisis. “It doesn’t escape me that we’re once again in a moment where there’s a lack of urgency when a public health crisis is impacting cis and trans men as well as non-binary folks within the same social and sexual networks,” Tyler TerMeer, the CEO of the San Francisco Aids foundation,  recently told  the Guardian.

{"title": "Australia can avoid big monkeypox outbreak with targeted vaccination, health experts say", "author": "Josh Taylor", "date": "Sat 30 Jul 2022 02.00 BST", "text": "Australia is in a good position to avoid a significant monkeypox outbreak by the time of WorldPride in Sydney in 2023 if state and federal governments harness the capability of sexual health organisations and appropriately target vaccines to gay and bisexual men over the coming months, experts say. As cases climb into the tens of thousands in the northern hemisphere, Australia on Thursday declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance”. There were 44 reported cases in Australia by Thursday, mostly in returned international travellers, people aged 21 to 40 years and men who have sex with men. The  global rise in cases  coincided with pride events in the northern hemisphere, where there are often large parties and travellers from across the globe. But the stigmatisation of the gay community during the Aids crisis in the 80s and 90slingers in public memory. This has led to some reluctance in media outlets globally to discuss monkeypox as something where 98% of cases globally are currently men who have sex with men. “Any health issue, scare, outbreak in which gay, bisexual men or queer people in general are targeted immediately brings up a lot of feelings given the last four decades of HIV responses in this country,” activist and co-founder of The Institute of Many, Nic Holas, said. “So whatever we’re doing, we’ve got to acknowledge that there’s going to be a lot of feelings about this in the mix with the science and the data and the facts.” Heath Paynter, deputy CEO of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, told Guardian Australia that monkeypox is a very different virus from HIV clinically, but it has a lot of similarities to HIV culturally. “That’s because it’s a virus that’s been transmitted through sexual contact and through interconnected sexual networks of gay and bisexual men at the moment in the northern hemisphere,” he said. “But it’s only a matter of time before that starts to happen in Australia with community transmission.” The World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,  said this week  that gay and bisexual men should consider reducing the number of sexual partners they have. But Prof Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV epidemiology and prevention program at the Kirby Institute, said that advice would not be effective unless people knew exactly when they would be able to be vaccinated. “I think you could argue that that’s what most gay men did during the Covid lockdowns, they stopped having casual sex, as [did] young heterosexual people for a few weeks,” he said. “That’s sustainable provided it’s not a long-term thing.” The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) this week updated its  clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox  to include the use of a MVA-BN vaccine named Jynneos, and experts believe a government deal to secure a supply of the vaccines is imminent. Holas said Australia has a chance to get ahead of the outbreak in the next few months, but it will take the right strategy to get on top of it, with a community-led response. “Queer people are the architects of safer sex – we invented safer sex. It wasn’t a clinician or a politician – we came up with those strategies, and we rolled them out at a community level,” he said. “So we hopefully see similar things here when it comes to monkeypox.” Paynter said the conversation about disease prevention should be led by people who can speak the language of the queer community, and targeted advertising on social media and through dating apps such as Grindr. “If the messaging is too broad, then what you might end up with is people being worried about the virus who actually aren’t a target or priority population, and then the resourcing ends up going towards the wrong population,” he said. “We must avoid a situation where people weaponise something like monkeypox, and this happened with HIV in many places around the world. We must have a language that is very respectful because we don’t want people being turned away, or at least not engaging in health services, for fear of being stigmatised, for fear of being judged.” Colin Batrouney, Thorne Harbour Health’s director of health promotion, policy and communications, said public health messaging needs to strike a balance between raising awareness and not causing panic.  “Our focus has been on what monkeypox is, how it is contracted, symptoms, treatment and prevention,” he said. “Our approach to sexual health and wellbeing has always been one of non-judgemental, clear information and positivity.” “The only moral dimension to the disease will be the inability or unwillingness of systems and governments around the world to deal with it.” Atagi has identified gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men as at highest risk, as well as sex workers. Grulich said it would make sense to prioritise gay and bisexual men who have travelled internationally for vaccination, followed by all highly sexually active gay and bisexual men. “Australia is a little bit fortunate that this has happened in the depths of winter when there’s not a lot in the way of great big gay gatherings for gay men,” he said. That will change when Sydney hosts WorldPride in February and March next year, and people will travel from all across the world. “It’s utterly critical that sexually active gay men be vaccinated. We’ve got a few months for that, we mustn’t lose sight of that, Grulich said. “It’s quite conceivable that we could get the great majority of sexually active gay men vaccinated in that time.” Paynter agreed. “I think we could really go close towards herd immunity through vaccination, subject to having enough supply of the vaccine.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/australia-can-avoid-big-monkeypox-outbreak-with-targeted-vaccination-health-experts-say"},

She said the primates could not be blamed for the surge in monkeypox cases in  Brazil  after reports in a number of cities of physical attacks on and poisonings of monkeys. In a natural reserve in Rio Preto, São Paulo state, 10 monkeys appeared to have been poisoned or intentionally injured in less than a week, according to the news site G1. Rescuers and activists suspect the monkeys were poisoned and attacked after three monkeypox cases were confirmed in the area.  Globally, more than 28,100 cases and 12 deaths have been recorded, as  monkeypox infections have risen since May  outside the west and central African countries where the disease has long been endemic. To date, Brazil has registered more than 1,700 cases and one death, according to WHO data. But Harris underlined that despite its name, monkeys are not the main transmitters of the disease and have nothing to do with the outbreak.  Monkeypox  received its name because the virus was first identified in monkeys kept for research in Denmark, but the disease is found in a number of animals, and most frequently in rodents. While the virus could jump from animals to humans, the recent global explosion of cases was due to close-contact transmission between humans, Harris said. “The concern should be about where it [is circulating] in the human population and what humans can do to protect themselves from getting it and transmitting it,” she said. People “should certainly not be attacking any animals”. Harris said the best way to rein in the virus was “if people recognise they have symptoms and go get help and medical care and take precautions to prevent it being transmitted”. That requires raising awareness among those most at risk. Nearly all the cases so far have been among men who have sex with men, and the WHO has cautioned against stigmatisation of those infected. “Any stigmatisation of any person infected is going to increase the transmission, because if people are afraid of identifying themselves as being infected, then they will not get care and will not take precautions,” Harris said. “So do not stigmatise any animal or any human, because if you do do that, we will have a much larger outbreak.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/brazilians-stop-attacks-monkeys-monkeypox-world-health"},

The third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine will be prioritised for at-risk groups including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, especially those travelling to countries with a significant outbreak. Australia has so far only had 58 cases of monkeypox in the 13 weeks since the virus began spreading in 76 countries outside those where it has been endemic for years. On 28 July  monkeypox was declared  a “communicable disease incident of national significance” in Australia after  a declaration by the World Health Organization . On Thursday the health minister, Mark Butler, told reporters in Canberra that the Morrison government had begun negotiations for the third-generation vaccine on 20 May, just one day after the first case in Australia and one day before the federal election. After 27 meetings, Australia has bought 450,000 doses including 100,000 to arrive this year and the remaining 350,000 in 2023. The vaccine can be used to prevent spread and post-exposure. Monkeypox can also be prevented with a smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, which is registered for use in Australia and contained in the national medical stockpile, but that vaccine uses a weakened live pox virus, making it unsuitable for the immunocompromised. Butler said the third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine was “by far the more effective and user-friendly for patients with compromised immunity”. It could also be administered to pregnant women, children and those with skin conditions. The minister said the government had procured the “world’s best vaccines for Australians and we are one of only a very limited number of countries that have been able to secure supplies of this third-generation vaccine in 2022 in a highly contested market”. “We will be rolling out the vaccine through state and territory largely, central health clinics,” he said, starting with the at-risk cohorts  identified by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation . These are: people categorised as a high-risk monkeypox contact in the past 14 days; gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men with a high number of sexual contacts; sex workers; and immunisation providers who are administering the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I’m very pleased with the work the chief medical officer and the department have been able to do in a short period of time, particularly the secure the supply of vaccines in a highly contested global market,” Butler said He noted that case numbers had “increased quite quickly” around the world, to more than 25,000 including 6,000 in the US, 4,000 in Spain, and 3,000 in the UK but Australia had “managed to avoid the worst elements you have seen in North America and Europe”. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he would not “pick a number” of estimated total cases. “But the important thing is all the work done since May in Australia, and the added benefit of the vaccine, will continue to help us to control the epidemic here in Australia and I’m very confident that will happen.” The Australian Federation of Aids Organisations acting chief executive, Heath Paynter, said “the swift procurement of these vaccines is a very positive step”. “While local transmission of Monkeypox has so far been limited, we can’t rely on that to continue,” he said. “Cities such as London, Montreal, Lisbon and Madrid are all dealing with significant community transmission.” “The availability of the monkeypox vaccine for people who need it is a critical forward defence against transmission. It will help people look after their own health as well as that of people they are intimate with.” Dr Nick Medland, a sexual health specialist and researcher at the Kirby Institute, said: “We expect the outbreak will begin to slow after 75,000 members of our community have had one dose of the vaccine and may not be eliminated until 250,000 doses have been administered to those who need them most.” Monkeypox results in  rashes and flu-like symptoms , which Kelly said in July were “relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments”. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” he said. “The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/australia-secures-450000-doses-of-monkeypox-vaccine"},

The announcement by the mayor,  Eric Adams , and the health commissioner, Ashwin Vasan, said as many as 150,000 city residents could be at risk of infection. The declaration will allow officials to issue emergency orders under the city health code and implement measures to help slow the spread. “We will continue to work with our federal partners to secure more [vaccine] doses as soon as they become available,” Adams and Vasan said in the statement. “This outbreak must be met with urgency, action and resources, both nationally and globally, and this declaration of a public health emergency reflects the seriousness of the moment.” In the past two days, the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a  state disaster emergency declaration  and the state health department called monkeypox an “imminent threat to public health”. New York had recorded 1,345 cases as of Friday, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California had the second-most, with 799. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared monkeypox a global health emergency  on 23 July and San Francisco’s mayor on Thursday announced a state of emergency over the growing number of cases. The once-rare disease has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades but was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere. To date, there have been more than 22,000 monkeypox cases reported in nearly 80 countries since May, with about 75 suspected deaths in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Congo. On Friday, Brazil and Spain reported deaths linked to monkeypox, the first reported outside Africa. Spain reported a second monkeypox death on Saturday. The virus spreads through prolonged and close skin-to-skin contact as well as sharing bedding, towels and clothing. In Europe and North America, it has spread primarily among men who have sex with men, though health officials emphasise that the virus can infect anyone. The type of monkeypox virus identified in this outbreak is rarely fatal, and people usually recover within weeks, but the lesions and blisters caused by the virus are painful. The virus is more of a concern among vulnerable people such as those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/new-york-city-monkeypox-public-health-emergency"},
{"title": "‘Like winning the lottery’: Americans struggle to get monkeypox vaccines", "author": "Gloria Oladipo", "date": "Sun 7 Aug 2022 11.00 BST", "text": "“It was like trying to win the lottery. It was so difficult.” On a hot Saturday afternoon last weekend, at  New York  City’s Bronx high school of science, Alexx Dunn, 42, waited in line for a monkeypox vaccine at a public health immunization site. For his elusive appointment that are usually only be booked online, Dunn needed two cellphones (the second borrowed from his co-worker), four different chances to sign up for the shot after failing to  get an appointment  with each new batch of time slots released, and precious time away from his job as a retail manager in the fashionable Manhattan shopping district of SoHo, work that he quickly returned to as soon as his Saturday appointment was over. In the US, the rapid increase of  monkeypox cases  has now officially been declared a  national public health emergency . Before Thursday’s announcement by the Biden administration, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, and the New York state governor, ​​Kathy Hochul, issued separate  emergency declarations . New York City has the bulk of US cases so far, with San Francisco also  badly affected . New York health officials offer vaccinations via an online sign-up portal under strict eligibility, including for those who may have been exposed to monkeypox. Currently, men and members of the LGBTQ+ community are the groups most affected, though anybody can contract the virus. But amid belated increases in appointment availability for those eligible since the  latest outbreak  of this  relatively rare virus  reached Europe  and the US  in the  second half of May , experts and patients are observing that the vaccination process privileges a select few. Those who have the most resources – time, fast internet access and electronic devices, knowledge on monkeypox and vaccinations, sometimes acquired via well-connected friends – have been best placed to snap up limited appointments, while leaving out marginalized communities. Demographic data on who’s getting vaccinated has been largely unavailable. But current figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that racial minorities make up the majority of US monkeypox cases,  ABC News reported . Data from 28 July showed that of the 4,600 reported US cases of monkeypox, Hispanic people accounted for 31% and Black people 27%, despite only making up 19% and 13% of the general population respectively. Data out of New York City  follows a similar trend. Out of 1,630 monkeypox cases in New York reported as of 4 August, Black and Hispanic people together made up more than half. But many worry that the vaccine process isn’t best serving the communities and neighborhoods worst affected by this, and  fears abound  amid  preventable spread .Last Saturday, some faced more challenges than others. “Super easy to sign up for online. No problem at all. Took me maybe three minutes to do the whole thing,” said Steven Harris, 39, who is white and was able to get the appointment while working from home in Manhattan and then travel to the Bronx, the city borough with the  lowest percentage  of white residents and the  highest rate  of poverty But others, such as Charles Robinson, 28, described a dissimilar experience, with Robinson, a biology PhD student, using two laptops to finally secure an appointment on the glitchy health website. “It’s complete bullshit. I don’t understand why we gotta do all this stuff to do one thing,” said Robinson, a Black man, after receiving his first of two recommended vaccine doses on Saturday after traveling from Harlem. Daslyn Colson, who also got a vaccine on Saturday, added that from what she had heard and seen – mainly the line being populated by white people despite the vast majority of Bronx residents being non-white people the overall process seemed to push out actual Bronx residents who may be disproportionately affected by monkeypox. “I know there were some issues the previous times when they had the first wave of vaccines available and people were coming into the Bronx and taking them from Black and brown folks. Seeing that a lot today.” Colson, a Black woman in her late 20s, travelled from East New York to get the vaccine, finding no available appointments online closer to her home. Colson’s observations echoed  complaints  and fears on social media and by others in line, that mostly privileged white people would be able to take advantage of the few available monkeypox vaccine resources. Jason Cianciotto, vice-president of communications and public policy at GMHC, the city non-profit born out of the HIV/Aids crisis in the early 1980s whose website says “Monkeypox: be aware but don’t panic”, spoke of the vaccine shortage. “It [impacts] the low-income communities of color, immigrants, transgender and gender non-conforming people who, for many reasons, have historically lacked access to healthcare, technology, [and may have] jobs that might prevent them from being able to hop online to try to get an appointment,” Cianciotto said. Cianciotto and Anthony Fortenberry, chief nursing officer at the city’s Callen-Lorde community health center, both spoke to the Guardian of a startlingly low level of available vaccine doses that is exacerbating existing health inequalities. New York City only has 79,000 monkeypox  vaccines available , with the US distributing less than one-third of the estimated 3.5m it will need, the New York Times  reported . “[With] the vaccine, when you ration healthcare, only the most privileged are able to access it,” said Fortenberry. For those who do not see a regular physician, getting information on monkeypox is difficult. LGBTQ+ adults, particularly transgender people, are more likely than the general population not regularly to see a doctor or have health insurance, according to a  June 2022 report  from New York state’s department of health. Even for those with healthcare coverage, information is patchy. “I had to do the research. I don’t see the information readily available. It was just by word of mouth,” said Colson, adding that the overall process has been “messy”. Similarly to Dunn, 23-year-old Zachary Skurka, who called the vaccination rollout a “hot mess”, had to call out of work to make his monkeypox vaccine appointment, adding that many of his friends have been unable to make or keep available appointments due to work conflicts. “It’s very hard,” said Skurka. “I’ve had a lot of friends who haven’t been able to book appointments because they’ve either been at work or didn’t make it to the appointment window on time to book one because they were too busy or the site wasn’t working. Many [different] reasons, so they’re still waiting,” he added as he waited outside the Bronx school. “Everybody doesn’t have the ability to wait by the phone and be able to play with the phone to be able to get the appointment,” added Jonathan Adams, 38, who commuted across the city to get the vaccine after snagging an appointment on his fourth try. Cianciotto said that many GHMC clients, particularly those with poor internet access or disabilities, have struggled in the current process.  While appointments can now be made via telephone for those struggling online, Cianciotto said that those additional options are poorly advertised. Inequality in vaccine supply is at risk of becoming  a global problem . New York City is slowly opening up more vaccine locations. But Sandile Mhlaba, 24, had to commute over an hour to the Bronx by  public transportation  from the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn to get the shot. “I’m an immunocompromised person so if I have to be on the subway [train] for a long period of time, around a bunch of people who aren’t wearing masks, that’s obviously really challenging, but I wanted to prioritize my health so I said it’s worth it for this,” Mhlaba said. Meanwhile, for Bronx residents like Julio Arniella, 56, the flood of people commuting for the vaccine, including from wealthier neighborhoods such as Manhattan’s Chelsea, has pushed him and other residents out of securing their shot. Arniella was only able to secure his vaccination when he used a different zip code, having been unsuccessful using his Bronx postal code, he said. “For a person like myself, living in the Bronx, I can’t even put my own zip code in to get an appointment,” said Arniella. “I was not able to get one in my own borough.” Representatives from the New York City department of health said data breaking down vaccinations by demographics was being worked on. The department sent along  23 July coverage  about outreach efforts in a gay bar in the Queens borough, more than two months  after the first US cases  in this outbreak, amid US public health  services being severely depleted  by the  catastrophic coronavirus pandemic . Back in the Bronx, Dunn talked about the pressure to get the monkeypox vaccine amid the crush of unmet demand. “Imagine thousands of people trying to get the vaccine at one time … I feel like I was trying to save my life, it was crazy,” said Dunn before rushing back to work.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/monkeypox-vaccine-appointments-new-york-san-francisco"},
{"title": "Slow response to monkeypox exposes ‘tired, overworked’ US health agencies", "author": "Jessica Glenza", "date": "Mon 1 Aug 2022 07.00 BST", "text": "A “slow and bureaucratic” response that has seen monkeypox spread rapidly across the US – with more than a thousand cases in New York City alone – reveals just how badly battered local health agencies have been since the Covid pandemic, advocates have said. Once a rare African virus, monkeypox has taken hold amid the ragged patchwork of city, county, state and federal agencies that make up the US public health infrastructure. “Unfortunately, delayed actions mean monkeypox has spread within the gay community and among other men who have sex with men,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “This outbreak has grown to be a public health crisis in America. We are still in a very chaotic situation at the state and local level with an organized response.” As an explanation for the chaos, many observers point to how Covid reshaped the landscape for public health officials. Once considered neutral arbiters of information, many health officials were  politically attacked  following  unpopular mask and vaccination policies . Across the country, public health officials were  harassed, threatened, fired or simply felt burned out and quit . The situation was not helped as resources that had once been devoted to things like tracking communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, or running routine vaccination clinics, were suddenly diverted to Covid-19. Sexual health clinics have struggled, too, as testing and staff resources were devoted to Covid-19, hurting organizations that had already suffered years of underfunding. The result has been worse health outcomes for many basic public health services:  routine vaccinations for children  have fallen;  overdose deaths have exploded ; and the US has posted a  record-high rate of sexually transmitted infections  for the sixth year running. As monkeypox has spread, the Biden administration has attempted to respond by releasing about 1.1m vaccines and ramping up testing capacity, which has grown from about 6,000 to 80,000 per week. The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a  global health emergency  this week, and the US could follow suit by declaring monkeypox a national public health emergency, which would release more resources to local agencies. “The system is tired, it’s overworked, it’s underpaid, it’s understaffed,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “All the same issues that plagued us during the pandemic are still with us and haven’t gone away. “What’s added to it, with monkeypox and beyond, is that we also have a workforce that has documented mental health trauma after the pandemic.” Public health advocates want the president and Congress to allocate more funds to respond to the outbreak, and for sexual health clinics in general. Public facilities have proven to be the first line of defense with monkeypox, even as federal prevention funding for such work has  fallen 41% since 2003 . “Local sexual health providers are being asked to respond to monkeypox on top of an already out-of-control STI epidemic in America,” said Harvey. “We are at the breaking point: we need the Biden administration and Congress to immediately fund STI public health programs and clinical services.” Although anyone can catch monkeypox, the virus has primarily affected men who have sex with men. Sexual health clinics have often been frontline responders to the outbreak because of how monkeypox can present its symptoms, with lesions around the genitals and the anus – though sex is just one way monkeypox can spread. Any close contact with an infected person can spread the disease, including touching, kissing and cuddling, as well as sharing glasses, utensils, bedding and towels. Although the virus, which belongs to the same family as smallpox, is rarely fatal, symptoms can be  excruciating , with painful lesions and flu-like symptoms, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Up to  10% of people  are reportedly requiring hospitalization, , and many are showing up in emergency departments because of severe pain, said Freeman. The situation is exacerbated because testing for monkeypox is limited. There is no home test and results can take days. There is, however, a vaccine, for which people at heightened risk may be eligible; they may also qualify for treatment with the drug tecovirimat, sold as TPOXX. But the barriers are significant, obtaining it can be tricky, and tecovirimat – usually reserved for people with severe symptoms – must be requested by doctors from the government’s national strategic national stockpile, which involves significant paperwork. Moreover, people without insurance probably lack access to both vaccine and drug, said Freeman; about 12.7% of the LGBTQ+ community lacks health insurance compared with 11.4% of the general population, according to  an analysis  by federal officials. Even if you do have insurance, there are hurdles baked into the US healthcare system, such as trying to navigate between urgent care clinics, primary care providers and state health departments. Freeman recounted a story she about a local health department that asked its state for information about a monkeypox outbreak. The state replied to check with the CDC; the CDC then redirected local officials back to the state. “There’s a lot of finger-pointing going on here,” she said. “We should have learned. We should know more now than we knew three years ago from our Covid response [about] what we need to do here.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/monkeypox-us-virus-vaccine-health-response"},

More than a quarter of all monkeypox cases in the US – 1,341 – are from New York state, with the  majority coming from New York City . Furthermore, the US leads the world in confirmed cases – nearly 5,000 as of Friday, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many have been clamoring to get a scarce number of available vaccination appointments. But getting vaccinated has proven to be a confusing process even for those who are eligible – namely, men who have sex with men and have multiple partners. Daniel Enderle, 31, came to the clinic after hearing from a friend about available vaccine appointments. Enderle hoped to get a shot by walking in for an appointment, but was turned away and referred by staff to the city health department’s online appointment portal. Currently, anyone interested in getting the vaccine must go through the city’s health department  website  and make an appointment. While all appointments have been filled through July, those eligible and interested are encouraged to check the portal for availabilities that open up because of cancellations,  the New York Times  reported. Close contacts of those who have monkeypox will be contacted separately and receive instructions on how to make a vaccine appointment. Enderle admitted he had not gotten a chance to research the process, but he said he hopes that public health employees find other ways to make the vaccination process more accessible, including creating walk-in appointments. “Get behind it before it affects too many people,” Enderle said. Michael Crawford, 57, said that while getting a vaccination appointment for monkeypox has not been as difficult for him, he has heard about the unreliable appointment process others are experiencing. “My experience seems to be very simple,” said Crawford, who had help making his appointment. “Everything I’ve seen in the media seems to be disastrous so I’m confused as to why there are two such starkly different experiences.” Complications around the vaccine rollout have also mirrored the stifled deployment of information on monkeypox as an illness. To many, monkeypox has  largely been characterized  as a sexually transmitted illness that primarily affects LGBTQ+ communities, even though the illness can spread by people in close or intimate contact with someone else. Enderle said that the characterization of monkeypox has brought on additional stigma. “It’s subtle, kind of like, ‘Be careful when you hang out with the gays,’” he said. Daniel Couri, who managed to get the vaccine, said the language used around monkeypox is similar to descriptors used during the HIV/Aids epidemic in the 1980s. “I don’t want it to be labeled as a gay disease,” he said. Many believe that more needs to be done by public health officials to increase awareness of the illness and availability of vaccines, despite continued attention on the coronavirus pandemic. “Get it together,” Crawford said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/us-monkeypox-vaccine-cases-rise"},
{"title": "Monkeypox virus: what are the symptoms and should Australia be worried?", "author": "Melissa Davey", "date": "Wed 3 Aug 2022 07.46 BST", "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has  declared monkeypox   a global public health emergency . Such a designation – the highest level of global alert – currently also applies to Covid-19 and polio. In Australia, more than 40 cases of monkeypox have been identified. The country’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, in late July declared it a “communicable disease incident of national significance” which means coordinated resources – including medicines, and public health campaigns – are needed to tackle it.  Europe remains the epicentre of the outbreak. So should Australians be worried? The monkeypox virus leads to flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, body aches and chills. It also causes a rash that may look like pimples, blisters, lesions or sores. The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak, it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people, Prof Kelly, said. People might only develop a couple of sores. Most cases of monkeypox in Australia have been among people aged 21 to 40 years. “The experience internationally and in Australia to date is most cases have been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men,” Kelly said. Condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission. Intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” the chief medical officer said. It’s important to note that the risk of monkeypox is not limited to men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious is at risk. Kelly said: “It is far less harmful than Covid-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic.”  Monkeypox  is also “far less transmissible” than Covid, he said. Yes. Information about the vaccines available in Australia, and who is recommended to receive them,  can be found here . Currently, only close contacts of cases and those at high risk of infection, as well as some health workers, are recommended for vaccination. According to Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease at the Australian National University, while monkeypox is “not highly transmissible from person to person” there needs to be a public awareness campaign, especially targeting at-risk groups such as men who have sex with men, as most cases have been identified in this group. “It’s obviously spreading,” he said. “If you look at the numbers, it’s not exploding like a respiratory virus, so this is very different to Covid and contact tracing is easier. But we will see more numbers and that’s why we need to diagnose the cases quickly.” The first case of monkeypox anywhere was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa, during intense efforts to find and eliminate smallpox. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When the virus appears outside Africa, it is because someone travelled to an endemic region, became infected and returned home. But it is increasingly being found in cases who had not travelled overseas before being diagnosed, which means local transmission is occurring. There are  two strains  of monkeypox: a Central African strain with a fatality rate of 10.6%, and a West African strain with a much lower mortality rate of between 1% and 3.6%. The latter is the strain that is spreading including in the UK and Australia. But there have been warnings in the past that countries outside Africa have become too complacent about the virus due to its rarity. A  study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases  in February found monkeypox cases, though rare, are rising. The study authors reviewed monkeypox data from many countries and studies, and found “an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults”. “These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission,” the study found. “The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease.” The authors urged increased worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases to understand its changing epidemiology, and described it as a “resurging disease”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/monkeypox-australia-symptoms-outbreak-virus-disease-cases-what-is-it-transmission"},

During a news briefing with reporters Xavier Becerra, the health secretary, said: “We’re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously.” Becerra plans to empower US officials to expedite countermeasures including vaccines and treatments, allowing for greater flexibility in the administering the supply of vaccines. Access to vaccines has been  a consistent problem  as the number of US monkeypox cases has risen. States and cities including New York and San Francisco have issued  declarations of emergency . “We will leave no stone unturned in our effort to combat this virus … This virus is moving fast,” said Robert Fenton, recently named by Joe Biden as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. The White House said it has made more than 1.1m doses available and has helped to boost domestic diagnostic capacity to 80,000 tests a week. The monkeypox virus spreads through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, including hugging, cuddling and kissing, as well as sharing bedding, towels and clothing. The people who have gotten sick so far have been primarily men who have sex with men. But health officials emphasize that the virus can infect anyone. The urgency in the current response stems from the rapid spread of the virus coupled with the limited availability of the two-dose vaccine called Jynneos, which is considered the main medical weapon against the disease. The doses, given 28 days apart, are currently being given to people soon after they think they were exposed, as a measure to prevent symptoms. During the call with reporters announcing the emergency in the US, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Robert Califf, said regulators are reviewing an approach that would stretch supplies by allowing health professionals to vaccinate up to five people instead of one with each vial of Jynneos. Under this so-called “dose-sparing” approach, physicians and others would use a shallower injection under the skin, instead of the subcutaneous injection currently recommended in the vaccine’s labeling. Califf said a decision authorizing that approach could come “within days”. That would require another declaration, to allow the government to alter its guidelines on how to administer the vaccine, officials said. Health officials pointed to a study published in 2015 that found that Jynneos vaccine administered that way was as effective at stimulating the immune system as when the needle plunger deeper into other tissue. But experts also have acknowledged they are still gathering information on how well the conventional administration of one or two full doses works against the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared monkeypox a global health emergency  on 23 July. Later that month the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”. Tedros said 98% of monkeypox cases detected since May had been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. He called for those at risk to take steps to protect themselves. “That means making safe choices for yourself and others, for men who have sex with men,” Tedros said. “This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/monkeypox-biden-administration-public-health-emergency"},

According to a World Health Organization report from 22 July, only five deaths had been reported, all in Africa.

{"title": "Monday briefing: Gay and bisexual men are most at risk from monkeypox. Why aren’t we saying so clearly?", "author": "Archie Bland", "date": "Mon 25 Jul 2022 06.28 BST", "text": "Good morning. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization  declared monkeypox to be a global health emergency , and said the outbreak “is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners”. In the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust  called for an urgent injection of cash to scale up vaccinations , which are being targeted at men in high-risk groups. And outside  Guy’s Hospital in London  yesterday, a three-hour queue snaked around the building to get a jab – with those waiting for their turn almost all gay and bisexual men. This makes sense: all the evidence suggests that the outbreak is highly concentrated among men who have sex with men, and the virus is overwhelmingly transmitted through sexual contact. But even as that has become abundantly clear, there has still been a curious reticence in much of the public health messaging about saying so. Today’s newsletter, with sexual health activist and researcher Dr Will Nutland and Guardian columnist Owen Jones, is about why that is, what the consequences are, and what a better way to talk about the problem might be. That’s right after the headlines. is facing “the greatest workforce crisis” in its history France endured another day of disruption unveil plans to curb China’s soft power sought to reassure Egypt over Russian grain supplies has executed four democracy activists Monkeypox is serious: symptoms include fever, an intense headache, a rash and lesions  that can be extremely painful . It can lead to hospitalisation and dangerous complications. But most cases are mild. While it can be fatal, there have been no recorded deaths linked to the current outbreak in the UK, and, the WHO said on Saturday, only five deaths among more than 16,000 reported cases worldwide. While most people are very unlikely to catch monkeypox at the moment, for the communities where it is spreading, it’s suddenly a huge subject. There are fears that if it is not stopped, it could become  an entrenched STD  (although it is not usually transmitted through bodily fluids, but through prolonged skin-to-skin contact). “I knew almost nothing about monkeypox about three months ago,” said Dr Will Nutland, co-founder of two organisations devoted to gay and bisexual men’s health,  PrEPster  and the  Love Tank . “Now it’s like another job on top of my job. I’m a bit monkeypoxed out.” Despite that concentration, as Guardian columnist Owen Jones has warned, efforts to talk about it clearly have sometimes been characterised as evidence of bigotry. “The madness” of that position,  he tweeted yesterday , “is that the logic of [the] argument is the vaccine shouldn’t be prioritised for men who have sex with men.” Here’s what we know about how monkeypox is spreading, and how it should be addressed: Almost all cases of monkeypox are among gay and bisexual men The evidence is clear:  an article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week , which looked at infections across 16 countries between April and June, found that 98% of cases were in gay or bisexual men. In 95% of cases, the infection occurred through sexual activity. The R number, of coronavirus fame,  is 1.6 for men who have sex with men in the UK , but below 1 for everyone else. In the UK,  more than 70% of cases were in London  as of 6 July. In short, said Nutland: “The vast, vast majority of cases are in gay and bisexual men, and pretending that that’s not the case doesn’t help any of us.” The public health messaging hasn’t always matched that reality A mantra of public health communication on the subject in the UK and US is that anyone can can catch monkeypox. “Well yeah, anyone   get monkeypox, but not anyone is getting monkeypox,” said Nutland. Lurking in the background of that approach is “the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which led to huge stigmatisation”, said Owen. In other words, part of what’s underpinning this may be a well-intentioned desire to avoid creating a sense of shame. “But if we’re not clear about where the risk is, it’s completely self-defeating, because that’s who we have to prioritise talking to and protecting.” That focus has started to change – and Nutland acknowledged that “it’s always hard in the early stages [of an outbreak] to understand where transmission is happening and what might happen next”. But the data has been clear for a while now. Nutland was keen to praise “some exceptional people” at the UK  Health  Security Agency, but he also said: “I really wish more attention had been paid to gay and bisexual men.” He points to a poster campaign, “Spot it, stop it”, saying: “The vast majority of that campaign has not targeted who it should have.” This PDF  shows a bafflingly generic example. A middle-aged straight couple in West Wittering might see it and conclude they’d better have separate beds for a while. A better approach, Nutland said, is the one being adopted by PrEPster and the Love Tank, which have distributed 5,000 information packs through saunas, sex shops and other venues whose clients are most likely to be at risk. Abstinence-based messaging (still) doesn’t work “I work alongside some people who want us just to call for gay and bisexual men to stop having sex for a month to get on top of this,” says Nutland. “But we know from Covid, from teenage pregnancy, from so much research on HIV, that when you tell people just not to do something, and particularly not to have sex, it doesn’t work.” And, after all, somebody likely to be receptive to an abstinence message is   likely to abstain once they’ve been told about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it’s transmitted. “For the others, it stops them seeking help if they’re unwell, and they’re more likely to end up hospitalised.” Owen also sees a kind of self-censorship at play among some gay and bisexual commentators (a frustration that led him to  start tweeting about it  about it last week). “People worry about washing the dirty linen in public – it’s almost like, ‘Don’t say it in front of the straights!’ So the discussions are huge for some people on WhatsApp and Instagram, but who is actually getting the right information becomes random. Younger gay and bisexual men, for example, might not have those networks.” Until vaccines are more easily available, there’s only so much communications can do It took Owen 20 phone calls to finally get an appointment for a vaccine. “You go right around the block,” he said. “Sexual health clinics are being overwhelmed, which also means their other services are massively under stress. I rang one place 10 times. They were inundated.” Meanwhile, “supervax” events like the one at Guy’s over the weekend are vital – but,  Nutland points out , other strategies are needed to reach those who may not be comfortable being visible in the queue, who are more likely to be from minority groups. The UK has ordered 100,000 additional doses of vaccine, and the NHS is stepping up vaccination in London (and now advising eligible people to wait to be contacted). It is a good start, says Nutland, but not enough. “Our best estimate if we’re going to double dose is we need at least another 150,000 doses” – and with only one manufacturer globally, that may take some time. Even so, he says: “It isn’t vaccine supply that is the key broken link – it’s our public health system, and our sexual health system in particular. Local authority budgets have been slashed over the last 12 years. And when councils have to make a decision between sexual health services or some other public health service, sexual health is still the poor relation.” dispatch from the eastern Donbas region Leah McLaren looks back  John Harris sees disruptive protest as the only way forward Amelia Tait explores met (over Zoom) for the first time | Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark  celebrated his first Tour de France title  after Belgium’s Jasper Philipsen brought the curtain down on the 109th edition with a sprint victory in Paris. | Max Verstappen  won the French Grand Prix , extending his lead over Charles Leclerc to 63 points after his title rival crashed out.

Meg Doherty, WHO’s director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said there was “quite a possible risk” that the countries bidding for supplies would be high-income countries. “We’ll have to watch out for this,” she said. “Our mantra has been and continues to be that we want equity. If WHO needs to say that louder and stronger for those countries who are not getting access, we will continue to do that. “We can’t have a  monkeypox response  that’s only responding to the UK, Canada, the United States. We need a response that also addresses what’s happening in the DRC right now; in Nigeria where  cases are going up .” Doherty was speaking at the  International Aids conference in Montreal , Canada, where Prof Chris Beyrer from Johns Hopkins University said on Friday that monkeypox was another preventable pandemic, and the warning signs were there five years ago. “It turns out that monkeypox emerged out of its central African endemic zone into west Africa in 2017, five years ago, and that outbreak has been ongoing for five years with no urgency, no response, no WHO engagement around vaccines in those countries,” said Beyrer, a member of an ongoing Lancet Commission on health and human rights. He added: “Now that it has gone from six endemic countries to 76, and is the new emerging global health threat in the wealthy world, we have this  sense of urgency .” Doherty said discussions were imminent with Japan, where another vaccine had been developed, and that 100m doses of smallpox vaccines also existed, but “that’s probably the least likely vaccine that most countries want to be using at this point in time, due to potential side-effects”. Vaccinating all those who need it will take a long time. In Montreal, only a third of the population most at risk, men who have sex with men, have been vaccinated – 20,000 doses out of 60,000 people estimated to be eligible in the city, said Marina Klein, research director of chronic viral illnesses at McGill University. Latest  WHO figures  show nearly 20,000 cases of monkeypox in 78 countries, and five deaths.

{"title": "UK needs urgent vaccine drive to curb monkeypox, campaigners say", "author": "Robert Booth", "date": "Sun 24 Jul 2022 17.16 BST", "text": "Health authorities are underestimating the scale of the response required to stop monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK, sexual health campaigners have warned, as a new vaccination drive is launched. The Terrence Higgins Trust urged the  NHS  and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to urgently pump cash into the system to pay more healthcare workers to administer vaccines. It also wants the number of doses ordered to be doubled to protect against a virus that has infected at least 2,208 people in the UK, according to the latest official figures. Monkeypox is usually mild and is spread by close contact with an infected person or animal, but the risk of severe disease is higher in children, pregnant women and people who are immunosuppressed. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV has estimated that at least 125,000 people will need vaccines, including gay men living with HIV, sex workers, and staff in sexual health clinics and saunas. A double dose of the smallpox vaccine is needed. Last week the NHS announced that it had procured at least 100,000 more doses. It is asking people to wait until asked to come forward for a vaccine, and is prioritising gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men who exhibit high-risk behaviour. Campaigners want more walk-in clinics amid “impatience” among people at risk. “There needs to be a [monkeypox] tsar charged with stopping this becoming endemic,” said Richard Angell, the campaigns director at the Terrence Higgins Trust. “We can’t accept that it gets into the system like chlamydia.” In a letter to the health secretary, Steve Barclay, on Saturday, Labour’s shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “I am concerned you are not acting with the urgency required, and that the response so far has lacked coordination from DHSC and NHS England,” he said. Labour said the vaccination programme was already diverting resources away from sexual health services’ delivery of core services including anti-HIV therapies and long-term contraceptions. “Your department has committed to achieve an 80% reduction in new HIV infections in England by 2025,” Streeting said. “It would be a scandal if progress towards achieving this were to be put in jeopardy.” A government spokesperson said the UKHSA was monitoring vaccine demand and would be able to quickly procure more doses as required. “The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine and are urging people to take up the offer as soon as they’re contacted,” they said. “We have provided more than £3.4bn to local authorities through the public health grant, enabling them to invest in essential frontline services including sexual health services.” On Saturday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization,  declared  the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. The body’s international health regulations emergency committee did not reach a consensus on whether the outbreak warranted the declaration, but Ghebreyesus said it was justified because the virus had “spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little”. He said the risk of monkeypox was “moderate” globally and “high” in Europe and that there was “a clear risk of further international spread”. The UKHSA  said last week  that transmission continues to occur primarily within interconnected sexual networks. “The most recent data suggests that the growth of the outbreak may have slowed,” it said. “This means that we continue to identify new infections, but at a more stable rate.” In a  statement on Friday , Steve Russell, the NHS director of vaccinations, said: “The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London … Thousands more people will be invited very shortly, with the number of clinics expanded too … We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/uk-needs-urgent-vaccine-drive-to-curb-monkeypox-campaigners-say"},
{"title": "New Zealand unable to say when monkeypox vaccines will arrive", "author": null, "date": null, "text": "New Zealand health officials have revealed they are stuck in the queue to order monkeypox vaccine and are unsure when it will arrive. Monkeypox cases continue to rise globally – more than 23,000 people in at least 75 countries have caught the virus. New Zealand confirmed a third case this week. The director of the National Public Health Service, Dr Nick Chamberlain, said New Zealand agencies “have been working to procure vaccines and antiviral treatments since we had our first case of monkeypox”, which was on 9 July. By that point, cases of monkeypox had already appeared in more than 30 non-endemic countries. “The vaccine is only manufactured by one company in the world and there’s a global shortage … and there is considerable international demand,” Chamberlain said. “We are part of a large number of countries who are endeavouring to access vaccine. Many have been unsuccessful.” Unlike New Zealand, Australia has received vaccine doses already, and on Thursday announced it had secured 450,000 doses of third-generation vaccine, which can also act as a treatment. On Thursday afternoon, associate health minister Ayesha Verrall said vaccines would be just one part of a “multi-factorial public health response”. “We’re working to develop a public health response that includes all elements of keeping people safe,” she said, saying New Zealand was “pushing very hard” to get a vaccine. This week, the Burnet Foundation Aotearoa and Sexual Health Society sounded the alarm on New Zealand’s lax response to the global outbreak, calling for a suite of measures.  The most at-risk community is men who have sex with men. Verrall said she “had been very clear with officials my expectation is that they work with members of the affected community to make sure that we do have effective and human rights compliant health promotional approach”. Meanwhile, thousands continue to catch Covid-19 every day. Health authorities, however, are still to sign off on expanding eligibility for a second booster shot, which remains unavailable to those under 50. Opposition Covid spokesperson Chris Bishop said that was the “wrong decision”. “Australia has gone to 30-plus. I don’t understand why we wouldn’t do that here,” he said. Previous director of health Ashley Bloomfield had said a decision on vaccine eligibility was due this week, but on Thursday the deputy director general of health, Andrew Old, said it was still being considered. “The evidence for repeat boosters for over-50s is pretty good, in younger age groups it’s less clear,” he said. Old said the current wave looked to have peaked, but hospitalisations and deaths may continue to rise. On Thursday, 49 New Zealanders were added to the death toll, with 140 deaths over the last week having Covid-19 as a contributing factor.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/new-zealand-unable-to-say-when-monkeypox-vaccines-will-arrive"},
{"title": "‘Is sex worth the risk?’ Monkeypox just the latest virus to threaten gay intimacy", "author": "Steven W Thrasher", "date": "Wed 3 Aug 2022 06.00 BST", "text": "Last week, I went to my doctor’s office for a long-scheduled sexually transmitted infection checkup, and started to cry a few minutes into my appointment. Like many gay men, I am on a daily drug called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which prevents me from becoming infected by HIV, even if I were to have sex without a condom or use injection drugs. At 44 years old, I am of the generation who knew about Aids before we even knew about sex; from childhood, I conflated sexuality and fear. PrEP was a gamechanger in taking that fear away. But last week, HIV was not much on my mind, and almost as soon as the physician’s assistant closed the door, I burst into tears. My doctor’s office is staffed almost entirely by gay people seeing gay patients, and the PA, like everyone there, was very kind. I told him that I hadn’t had much sex lately because I was concerned about monkeypox. Even though I had no fever, and even though I often get heat rash in the summer, I was terrified that some skin bumps could be monkeypox. Because he was so nice, I blabbered on that I would   tell anyone   to feel bad if they contracted   infection. But my book was coming out the following week, and it was   viruses, and The PA very sweetly talked me through my feelings and told me that while he didn’t think I had monkeypox, we could do a test if I wanted. He also kindly, but very firmly, told me not to feel bad about feeling bad. “We are all on the edge,” he said – him, me, every gay man we both knew. “It’s been a lot, for all of us.” I realized in that moment how lucky I am to have a gay doctor’s office to take my body and my feelings seriously. And I realized how angry I was that, for the third time in my life, a viral pandemic was dictating my sex life, shaping my professional life, messing with my head, and keeping me from experiencing intimacy. I am, of course, not alone in this. HIV, Sars-CoV-2 and now hMPXV – the virus responsible for monkeypox in humans – have all upended people’s lives, but their effects have not been felt equally. In all three cases, LGBTQ+ people were  disproportionately affected . This is the result of a few related factors, all of them closely linked to societal stigma. One is that LGBTQ+ people are, on average,  more likely to be poor  than straight people and thus more likely to be subjected to the confluence of conditions (incarceration, unemployment, a lack of insurance) that produce a viral underclass. Second, queer people  do not get  a good sexual health education, nor access to queer-specific health resources. And third, gay men have, on average,  more  sexual partners than straight people. Even when coupled, gay men are more likely to be  openly non-monogamous . This is nothing to be ashamed of; being trans or gay is  and queer sex is good. But many people – even many queer people – have internalized the idea that contracting (or even talking about) STIs is bad, shameful and should be hidden. I’ve studied viruses as a journalist, social scientist, and professor of sexual health for more than a decade. Many viruses, including HIV, HPV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, are  categorized as STIs by the CDC  despite being transmitted in a variety of ways. In some places, a large percentage or outright majority of HIV cases now transmit via injection drug use. But a major way these pathogens still transmit is  , and it’s important to name that so that people having sex can know how to protect themselves and their partners. For the same reasons, the emerging monkeypox epidemic should be talked about as an STI, particularly in light of new  research  from the current London outbreak and  scandalously overlooked  research into the  2017 outbreak  in Nigeria that suggests monkeypox may have mutated to allow for transmission through genital secretion. This does not mean that hMPXV can only be transmitted sexually, but it acknowledges that gay sex is a major way such pathogens move. Shame should not be a factor in these discussions. “Viruses are not conscious,”  said  Pedro Serrano, a public health researcher. “They simply follow the mechanistic drive to replicate.” Viruses may not be conscious, but those who choose to punish us for contracting them certainly are. In America, an established (and currently ascendant) political movement exists to punish certain classes of people – trans people, women, gay people, those trying to prevent pregnancy – for having sex. While monkeypox is threatening to repeat the patterns of the past, it is worth remembering that for gay men, this is not our first rodeo. We have loved one another and formed connections even as police officers, bosses, educators, viruses and families of origin have tried to keep us apart. It is wearying having to ask ourselves, once again: are intimacy and sex worth the risk? Still, now is the time to remember or learn anew that queer men of all ages have been doing this for decades. After the Stonewall Riots of 1969, there was a brief window of time when queer men could have a lot of sex with relatively little worry. But then, in the early 1980s, reports trickled in that young gay men were becoming marked by purple lesions and falling ill to an extremely rare form of cancer that usually only affected older men near the Mediterranean Sea. The era of Aids was upon us. To Ash Kotak, monkeypox lesions were reminiscent of those purple Kaposi sarcoma lesions that he saw on loved ones when the Aids pandemic began. A London-based playwright who leads the campaign for the Aids Memorial in London, Kotak lost a “boyfriend, ex-boyfriend and many friends” to Aids and has been living with HIV himself since 1993. “My friends and so many died due to a lack of an early response in the USA and the UK,” he told me. “The issue now is like then: the response is woefully inadequate with the same shaming of gay men, and blaming, too.” Gay men responded to HIV by beginning to use an old technology that had previously been limited to straight people seeking to prevent pregnancy: condoms. Through peer-to-peer education, gay people taught each other how to have sex and intimacy in a safer way, saving countless lives. They also saved millions of lives when, through activism by the group Act Up, they upended the process for drug trials, paving the way for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for Aids and creating the medical architecture that was used to rapidly develop Covid-19 vaccines decades later. The development of those ARVs meant that by 1996, “you didn’t need to die of Aids”, says Thomas Strong, a friend of mine and a Dublin-based American anthropologist and HIV activist who has been living with HIV since 2006 without any health problems. “Then the question becomes, ‘How important is sex? Is it worth   risk?” Strong says, noting that the decline of nearly all Covid mitigation protocols suggests that, for our governments, “the economy is worth the risk”. “Is sexual intimacy worth the risk?” he asks. “It’s in this context of values that vice is structured.” ARVs have been so effective that when properly medicated, people living with HIV cannot pass HIV onward to sex partners. And the medication has been tweaked so that HIV-negative people can proactively avoid the virus, too. In 2012, PrEP was approved by the FDA, allowing people like me to enjoy sex with more intimacy and less fear. And since people on PrEP are required to get tested every few months, the drug also created an architecture for detecting and treating other STIs. PrEP liberated younger gay men and other queer and trans people from the stress and fear around sex that remained even after the development of ARVs. Jafet, a 27-year-old graduate student from Los Angeles who asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that when he first moved to San Francisco for college, having sex without a condom would fill him with terror and anxiety. When sexual partners taught him about PrEP, which he has now taken for six years, he felt liberated. “I felt so privileged,” he said. “A generation before me didn’t have this freedom and luxury to enjoy sexuality without worry. And I felt lucky to be gay. I didn’t have to worry about a disease that is treatable but incurable,   I didn’t have to worry about pregnancy.” Jarret, a 21-year-old from Idaho who also asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that he had never had sex without PrEP. Growing up the son of a minister who railed against gay sex, he was terrified of his own desires. “I really grew up believing I wan’t going to live very long because I was gay,” he said. When he went away to college, he was afraid to do anything more than masturbate with another man – and even that would send him into a tailspin of “debilitating” anxiety about HIV. A therapist helped him get on PrEP, and he was able to have his first sexual experience without fear. “It was very profound,” he said. “Everything I had feared in my head was gone. I was able to enjoy myself and not stress.” But then, in 2020, the dreaded coronavirus came along, with  devastating effects for LGBTQ+ people . With breathing itself the major mode of transmission, techniques gay men were accustomed to using for safer sex, such as condoms, were no longer sufficient. Queer health educators instead  encouraged  people to practice masturbation, sexting, video sex or phone sex or to use “glory holes” in the early days of the pandemic. Covid-19 vaccines paved the way for a very horny summer of 2021 – but it was to be just one summer, because by Pride month in 2022,  monkeypox  was on the move. “With Covid, there was a quick government response,” noted Kotak. “With monkeypox, yet again, the queer community have had to push for a response.” In the absence of government help, gay sex parties cancelled themselves, and community groups mobilized to demand the government distribute  hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses  that it owned but had chosen not to make available. The outbreak is threatening all the progress that was made toward freeing gay men to have sex without fear. Jafet told me that he’s stopped having sex out of worry, “especially because monkeypox is so visual”. It frustrates him that he can’t find a vaccine “in the summer, on vacation, when I should be able to enjoy the boys safely!” When I spoke to Strong, he had been quarantined in Dublin for three weeks due to monkeypox. He had 50 lesions on his body. At times, it was so painful, he wanted to be hospitalized. Monkeypox has brought up a fear he once expressed to me about his HIV diagnosis: “I am terrified that no one will ever touch me again.” But in conversations he’s had on Grindr – “I’m still flirting and chatting, even though I’m quarantining” – he has been pleasantly surprised that some gay men have said: “Well, I’ll see you in a few weeks when you’re better.” “Our love of sex is going to save us,” he told me. “It’s going to teach us how to be human in an epidemic that wants to keep us apart”. The fight for our sexual freedoms is not without its enemies. This month, Jonathan Mitchell, an anti-abortion Republican and former solicitor general of Texas, filed a federal  lawsuit  seeking to limit access to PrEP. This attack on gay men’s sexual health is just one part of the misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic and anti-sex movement that is attempting to retract hard-won civil rights for women and LGBTQ+people in the US, from the overturn of Roe v Wade to the passage of the “don’t say gay” bill in Florida. Shame is heaped upon gay men, just as it is heaped upon transgender or gender-nonconforming people, people seeking abortions in the US, and people in poor countries needing medicines and vaccines. We must all navigate medicalized sex lives, and that puts us in solidarity with one another. When a virus like monkeypox moves in a way that can out us, the answer is not to shrink, or to hide, or to be embarrassed about the kind of sex we have. Rather, these times demand that we refuse to be relegated to a viral underclass – and compel us to destroy the conditions that created such an underclass in the first place.

Academics from Naresuan University, in Phitsanulok province, northern Thailand, began testing sewage at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport in May, adopting a technique that has also been used to track the spread of Covid-19. Monitoring wastewater is thought to be a quicker, more cost-effective way to understand the spread of the monkeypox, compared with testing individuals. Monkeypox can be detected in the faeces of an infected person, even during the latent phases when they are not displaying symptoms, according to officials quoted by Thai media. Dr Thanaphon Penrat, of Thailand’s ministry of higher education, science, research and innovation, said there was no risk of sewage water spreading the disease: “The detection of monkeypox traces in sewage waste water is considered safe and there is no evidence of the possibility to get infected via sewage waste water. [It’s the] same as Sars-CoV-2, which can not be transmitted through sewage waste water.” The research, which is funded by a science research and innovation fund through the national research council of Thailand, did not find any traces of the virus when the project was piloted at Suvarnabhumi airport. Only one case of monkeypox has so far been identified in Thailand. The global monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), the strongest call to action the agency can make, last week, and has been detected in 78 countries. Previously, wastewater monitoring has allowed researchers to spot the arrival of new Covid strains before widespread outbreaks occur, allowing local areas to prepare health services. The arrival of the Delta variant in Phitsanulok and Yala provinces in Thailand was spotted 20 days before an outbreak occurred, while Omicron was earlier spotted 10 days in advance, officials told Thai media.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/thai-researchers-test-wastewater-to-track-spread-of-monkeypox"},

{"title": "San Francisco and New York state on emergency footing over monkeypox", "author": "Maanvi Singh", "date": "Fri 29 Jul 2022 16.50 BST", "text": "San Francisco officials announced a state of emergency on Thursday in response to an escalating number of monkeypox cases in the city and a national shortage of vaccines. “We are at a very scary place. And we don’t want to be ignored by the federal government in our need. So many leaders of the LGBT community have also, weeks ago, asked for additional help and support and assistance,” said San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, who added that the city was in “desperate need of vaccines”. The declaration will allow local authorities to mobilize more resources and staff to confront the outbreak and accelerate emergency planning. The city has recorded 261 cases so far, out of about 4,600 across the US, according to the San Francisco department of public health. “San Francisco is an epicenter for the country. Thirty per cent of all cases in California are in San Francisco,” said the San Francisco health officer Susan Philip. In a crisis that so far has disproportionally affected men who have sex with men, she added, “I’m issuing this declaration to reaffirm our commitment to the wellbeing of these communities and to allow us to move more quickly to obtain and distribute the resources needed to help those disproportionately impacted.” Also on Thursday, New York’s state commissioner of health, Dr Mary T Bassett, declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health. More than a quarter of cases in the US – 1,341 – are in New York, mostly  concentrated in New York City . Last week, San Francisco leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates protested in front of the US Department of Health and Human Services’ regional office against what they saw as a sluggish response to the monkeypox outbreak. “San Francisco was at the forefront of the public health responses to HIV and Covid-19, and we will be at the forefront when it comes to monkeypox,” state senator Scott Wiener, a representative of San Francisco, said in a statement. “We can’t and won’t leave the LGTBQ+ community out to dry.” No emergency closures or restrictions have been planned, as monkeypox spreads primarily through very close, skin-to-skin contact. But local health organizations in San Francisco have been advocating for easier, broader access to testing and more vaccine doses. These calls are echoed by leaders in other large cities, where  epidemiologists  warn that initial delays in rolling out tests mean that the actual number of cases very likely outnumber the confirmed cases. “In the face of a frustratingly slow federal response, it is all the more important that we be able to mobilize all available local resources to get vaccines into arms as quickly and equitably as possible,” San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman said. So far, San Francisco has received 8,200 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox. But officials had initially requested 35,000 doses to cover the most vulnerable residents. Residents have had to wait in long lines for scarce doses. “We should have been able to quickly control this outbreak,” Wiener  told the Guardian last week . “And instead it’s like Mad Max Thunderdome to get a vaccine.” Health workers argue that more local resources are needed to reach especially vulnerable residents, including unhoused populations. In  New York , Bassett said: “Based on the ongoing spread of this virus, which has increased rapidly and affected primarily communities that identify as men who have sex with men, and the need for local jurisdictions to administer vaccines, I’ve declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health throughout New York state.” New York City officials and other authorities nationally and internationally increasingly fear monkeypox  becoming uncontainable .", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/san-francisco-monkeypox-state-of-emergency"},

{"title": "San Francisco’s LGBTQ+ leaders demand better access to monkeypox vaccines", "author": "Maanvi Singh", "date": "Thu 21 Jul 2022 11.00 BST", "text": "San Francisco leaders and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups gathered this week in front of the US Health and Human Services’ regional office to protest what they see as a sluggish response to the monkeypox outbreak. “There’s a lot of anger and it’s totally justified,” said state senator Scott Wiener, who joined protesters from the Alice B Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club, San Francisco Aids Foundation and Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club and other groups demanding increased access to monkeypox vaccines, testing and therapeutics for an outbreak that so far has been disproportionately  affecting  gay and bisexual men. In San Francisco, where prominent LGBTQ+ advocacy groups that 40 years ago led protests against a government that ignored and undermined the Aids crisis, “there’s a lot of PTSD in the community”, Wiener said. Gay and bisexual men are left once again wondering why their community is being failed by the federal government, he added. Although monkeypox has gained an initial foothold among networks of men who have sex with men, it could have taken off among any other social group, epidemiologists say. It can spread through very close contact, such as skin-to-skin contact including during sex, or by sharing infected items like clothing and bedding. “It doesn’t escape me that we’re once again in a moment where there’s a lack of urgency when a public health crisis is impacting cis and trans men as well as non-binary folks within the same social and sexual networks,” said Tyler TerMeer, CEO of the San Francisco Aids foundation. “And personally, as someone who is a Black gay man who has been living with HIV for 18 years, it is hard for me to not question whether or not there would be a more robust response to this outbreak if it first began spreading among another population.” For weeks, the leaders of local health organizations in San Francisco have been advocating for easier, broader access to testing and more vaccine doses. Their concerns have been echoed by leaders in other major cities, where  epidemiologists  warn that early delays in rolling out tests mean that the actual number of cases likely outnumber the confirmed ones. San Francisco tallied 141 cases of monkeypox as of Wednesday. Meanwhile, the city’s health department quickly said an initial allocation of 2,300 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox, was far from enough. This week, it will receive an additional 4,200 doses – a fraction of the 35,000 that were requested for its most vulnerable populations. A drop-in vaccine clinic at the San Francisco general hospital opened Wednesday, but said it has only 300 shots to offer each day. Christopher Artalejo-Price, a San Franciscan who works with the Aids foundation and in nightlife , said he made his way across the Bay Bridge to get his vaccine in Berkeley. He waited three hours during his first try – only to be told that the clinic had run out of doses, and then went back another day and waited eight hours before getting his shot. “I brought my lunch, and a bottle of water. I brought a charger for my phone – I had to take work calls while I was waiting in line,” he said. Those who were queued up traded tips on where to go nearby to use the restroom and held each other’s spots. “And I felt so lucky because I had a job where I could ask my boss for the time off to do this,” he said. “It was just a really humbling and sad moment.” In a letter to Xavier Becerra, the US Health and Human Services secretary, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and representative of San Francisco, said the current vaccine supply was “woefully inadequate”. The US has had a small stockpile of the vaccine, and has ordered millions more. But the factory that produces the vaccine has been shut since last August, due to a planned expansion, and shipments are expected to trickle in slowly. Public health experts have criticized the government’s reliance on a single manufacturer, and its failure to set up an alternative means of producing and stockpiling the vaccine ahead of the outbreak. San Francisco activists compared these delays and misjudgments not only to the early days of the Aids epidemic, but also to the US Covid-19 response – and initial delays in rolling out testing and guidance. “We should have been able to quickly control this outbreak,” Wiener said. “And instead it’s like Mad Max Thunderdome to get a vaccine.” Treatment for those who test positive also remains difficult to access, San Francisco healthcare and LGBTQ+ advocacy agencies said. To access TPOXX, an FDA-approved and stockpiled drug that may ease the sometimes severe symptoms of monkeypox, providers have to submit lengthy paperwork to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which many smaller hospitals and clinics don’t have the capacity to do. As a result, “members of the gay community have been messaging each other to try to find it and are growing increasingly angry that they cannot access the one drug that could ease the suffering of people with monkeypox”, wrote physician Jay K Varma and health activist Joseph Osmundson in  Stat , a health and medicine publication. Monkeypox is rarely fatal, but the disease can be very painful for some. And for those who have been exposed or infected, long isolation periods can be physically or economically infeasible. “We just can’t let this spread in our community,” Wiener said. Health workers and advocates also worry that the scarce options for testing and vaccination are leaving out gay and trans people in San Francisco who are unhoused, and those who cannot easily access information about health resources. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, health workers from the San Francisco Community Health Centre have been taking information, tests and vaccines out to the streets, to meet patients where they are, said the organization’s CEO Lance Toma. Smaller health centers and clinics working with marginalized communities will need the resources, access and funding to do the same with monkeypox tests and vaccines, he said. “We also just need to do more in terms of educating our patients about monkeypox, the risks, and how to stay safe – we have a lot of work to do,” he said, noting that one recent patient showing symptoms had very little awareness of the outbreak, and was diagnosed only after he came into the clinic for unrelated reasons. “The bottom line is that there’s been such a tepid response to this outbreak at all levels,” Toma said. “And I feel like the folks that we serve – especially folks who are homeless, the trans community, and even gay men of color – we’re always last in line for resources.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/san-franciscos-lgbtq-monkeypox-vaccine-access"},
{"title": "‘I literally screamed out loud in pain’: my two weeks of monkeypox hell", "author": "Wilfred Chan", "date": "Sat 23 Jul 2022 19.07 BST", "text": "I got monkeypox and it’s been a total nightmare. When New York Pride festivities kicked off on 24 June, I was aware that monkeypox was an emerging issue – especially for  gay men  – but I was also under the impression that the number of cases in the city was relatively small. What I didn’t understand was how absolutely dismal testing capacity was: at that point, the city only had capacity to process  ten tests a day . I had sex with several guys over the weekend. Then a week later, on 1 July, I started feeling very fatigued. I had a high fever with chills and muscle aches, and my lymph nodes were so swollen they were protruding two inches out of my throat. First, I took a Covid self-test: negative. Then I started suspecting monkeypox. I texted a friend:  I’m a 39-year-old man from Sweden, living in Brooklyn and working in philanthropy. For the past decade, my work has primarily focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights, so I followed the outbreak from the very beginning. I had even tried to get vaccinated when New York City launched an  initial vaccination drive  on 23 June. But like the vast majority of other New Yorkers who tried to get an appointment, I had no luck. Two days after my symptoms began, the rash started as anorectal lesions – painful sores on my anus and rectum. Initially it was a stinging, itchy feeling. I wasn’t scared at this point. I was told that it would be mild, and I was a completely healthy individual with no underlying conditions. But I had no idea how bad it was going to get. I had a tele-health visit with my primary-care physician (PCP) and she agreed that I should get tested. So I went to urgent care. I had all the symptoms of monkeypox and thankfully nobody questioned whether or not I should receive a test. I also asked for a full STI panel. I wanted the antiviral drug that is being used to treat monkeypox, TPOXX, but you need a positive test result first. So they sent me home with Tylenol. ( European regulators  have approved TPOXX as an effective monkeypox treatment, but the FDA has only approved it to treat smallpox. The  CDC  maintains a stockpile of TPOXX and allows for its “compassionate use” during monkeypox outbreaks.) After I went home, the rash started spreading, and I began to feel anxious. I developed lesions literally everywhere; they started out looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would eventually pop, then finally scab before leaving a scar. I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back, and five just on my right elbow. At the peak, I had over 50 lesions, a fever of 103F and intense pain, prompting a panic attack. Ironically, the only place I didn’t have lesions was my penis. The next day I got my STI results: positive for gonorrhoea. But no word yet on monkeypox. That’s when I developed hives everywhere on my body from my neck down, as well as a headache, arthritis pain in my fingers and shoulders and a strange pain in my shin bone that got so painful that I couldn’t stand up. At night, I would wake up going crazy with both pain and itching from the lesions and hives, just sitting up in bed and scratching myself. I was isolated, lonely and frustrated with how unfair the situation was. I was clearly very sick, yet had to cobble together a care plan on my own. My anorectal lesions, which were already very painful, turned into open wounds. It felt like I had three fissures right next to each other, and it was absolutely excruciating. I would literally scream out loud when I went to the bathroom. Even keeping the area clean, like washing myself, was extremely painful. It was a two hour process each time. Four days after my test – I got a call from urgent care that I had tested positive for monkeypox. But they gave me no information beyond that. So I started calling around to see how I could get access to the antivirals  I knew the CDC had put out  guidance  around who should be considered for treatment, and that included people who had anorectal lesions, lesions in the throat and dermatological conditions, which I did. But I was just referred in circles. I would call urgent care, who told me to contact the department of health. The department of health would say, “Oh no, your PCP has to request treatment for you.” Then I would contact my PCP, and they were like, “We can bring the case to the department of health, but just so you know, they deny most of our requests, so don’t get your hopes up.” Then my throat started swelling up. My tonsils were covered in white pus. I did a video with someone in my PCP’s office and they said, “I think you should go to the ER.” The ER determined it was bacterial tonsillitis, and they gave me a round of antibiotics. But when I asked them for antivirals, they said they wouldn’t give them to me because they only gave it to people who were severely immunocompromised. I told them, “That’s not the CDC treatment guidelines.” They wouldn’t have it, and they discharged me at 2 am. I was incredibly demoralized. The next evening, I finally got a call from a clinic at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center. They said DoH had asked them to take on my case. So that was apparently how I was one of the lucky few to be invited for treatment. Because the drug hasn’t been extensively tested in humans, there’s quite a significant informed consent and intake process. I spent about an hour at the clinic and walked out with a two week supply of TPOXX. I was so relieved. You have to take three pills every 12 hours, with a high fat diet. I’m eating a lot of bacon and whipped cream, which is the second best thing about this treatment. The lesions started drying out very quickly and I’m now down to just three tiny little scabs left. Only in the last couple of days have I been able to go to the bathroom without pain. I’m still in isolation. I can’t tell you how sick of my apartment I am right now. I’m a pretty privileged person in that I have the resources necessary to order food and medicine and get it delivered to my door. I have laundry in my apartment, so I can wash my bedsheets and clothes. I know other people who are really struggling with isolation because they don’t have the situation I have. The day after I started the treatment, 13 July, I finally got a call from a contact tracer from the department of health, who said I may have been exposed to monkeypox on 26 June. I told her I already have monkeypox, and she asked me about my symptoms. The call lasted about half an hour and she was obviously reading off a script. Then she was like, “Okay, thanks for your time, get well,” and hung up. She didn’t even ask me what contacts I’d had. This whole thing just feels like a huge failure that should not have been allowed to happen, especially not two and half months into the outbreak. If someone like me, who has worked in sexual health for a long time, had such a hard time navigating care, I can’t imagine other people doing it. I know several people who are just sitting at home in agonizing pain because they’re not getting the support that they need. I’m pretty worried that we’re close to the point that this is going to be another endemic disease, especially among gay men, if we haven’t passed that point already. I’m worried we’ll be stuck with it forever.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/i-literally-screamed-out-loud-in-pain-my-two-weeks-of-monkeypox-hell"},

{"title": "US to distribute 800,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine after weeks of delay", "author": null, "date": "Wed 27 Jul 2022 19.24 BST", "text": "After weeks of delays, nearly 800,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine will soon be available for distribution, US health regulators said on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, it was reported that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to make the rapidly spreading disease a nationally notifiable condition, a move that would streamline reporting of cases. Through the designation, which will probably take effect on 1 August, the agency will direct all states to share surveillance data, including case numbers,  Politico said , citing people with knowledge of the matter and a letter sent to state epidemiologists on Monday. States will be required to report confirmed or probable monkeypox cases within 24 hours, Politico said. State health departments are not yet required to provide the federal government with standardized data on monkeypox. More than 3,500 monkeypox cases were reported in the US as of Tuesday, according to the CDC. Joe Biden could  declare the disease a public health emergency  by the end of the week, insiders told Politico. That would allow access to additional funds and expand staffing. The announcement that more doses of vaccine are on the way came amid growing criticism that authorities have been too slow in deploying the vaccine, potentially missing the window to contain what could become an entrenched infectious disease. Nearly two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had finished inspections at Bavarian Nordic’s facility in Denmark, where the company fills vials of the vaccine. The FDA said on Wednesday the certification had been finalized. The doses are already in the US “so that they would be ready to be distributed once the manufacturing changes were approved”, the agency said. The US has sent more than 310,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine to state and local health departments. But clinics in San Francisco, New York and other large cities say they don’t have enough shots. The head of the US Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday officials would announce more allocations on Thursday. Monkeypox mainly spreads through skin-on-skin contact but it can also transmit through touching linens used by someone with the infection. The vast majority of cases reported have been in men who have sex with men, though health officials have stressed that anyone can catch the virus. People with monkeypox may experience fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. Many in the outbreak have developed zit-like bumps on many parts of the body. The sluggish federal response has drawn comparisons to the initial days of the Covid outbreak. Experts had pointed out that the US had one huge advantage: more than 1m doses of vaccine in the strategic national stockpile. But it turned out US officials had only about 2,000 doses on hand when the outbreak was identified in May. Shipping and regulatory delays have meant only a portion of the rest were deployed. “There’s not enough doses,” said Perry Halkitis of Rutgers University. “I think with some quicker action on part of federal government we might not be in the situation we are now.” The doses previously shipped came from a separate facility in Denmark that had FDA clearance. Another 786,000 doses made at a newly opened Bavarian Nordic facility were awaiting the US certification announced on Wednesday. The FDA requires inspections of all vaccine manufacturing plants to assure safety, sterility and consistency of production. US officials announced orders this month for 5m more doses, though most of those are not expected to arrive until next year. Officials have recommended the shots be given to people who know or suspect they were exposed to monkeypox in the previous two weeks. The Jynneos vaccine has never been widely used in response to an outbreak like this, and the government will track how well it’s working.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/us-monkeypox-vaccine-delay-health"},
{"title": null, "author": "Wilfred Chan", "date": "Fri 22 Jul 2022 11.00 BST", "text": "But Staley’s years of criticizing the nation’s decision makers on health crises, particularly as part of the legendary Aids pressure group Act Up New York, have brought him into the fold. As the co-founder of the group  PrEP4All , Staley has the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Rochelle Walensky, “on speed dial”. He regularly emails with the National Security Council’s pandemic chief, Raj Panjabi. And he has become  close friends  with Dr Anthony Fauci, who he says frequently turned to him for advice during the coronavirus pandemic. Those friendships are now being tested as Staley sounds the alarm on the federal government’s response to monkeypox, which he calls a “fucking mess”. “We’re close to the point where we’re wanting to call for the resignations of people we consider friends,” he told me by phone on Wednesday. “Unlike what a lot of people are saying, it’s not Aids 2.0, where we have a government filled with homophobes who don’t care about us. But it is Covid 2.0. It’s basically a copy and paste.” Monkeypox is a viral disease that can cause  symptoms  including fever, headache, body aches and lesions across the body. It has been prevalent in parts of central and western Africa, where it was first discovered in humans in the 1970s. After a small outbreak in the US midwest in 2003, it did not appear in the country again until 17 May this year, in what’s now a rapidly growing epidemic. Most of the confirmed cases so far are among men who have sex with men, although anyone can contract it through close physical contact. PrEP4All, which was formed to fight for access to HIV medication in the tradition of Act Up, has become one of the main players pushing US officials to speed up the nation’s monkeypox response, Staley told me. As such, it has also been an important witness to what he sees as the government’s repeated blunders. “The CDC, the FDA, and all of it – they haven’t learned a single lesson from Covid. They haven’t spent the time to make sure that they don’t repeat those mistakes, because all of them have been repeated.” The government’s first “fuck-up” with monkeypox, Staley says, was not ensuring adequate tests. By late May, initial tests with gay men were coming back more than 50% positive. “That means you’ve got a huge problem. So we screamed at the CDC.” But as with the early days of the coronavirus, the CDC insisted on running all testing, locking out private health companies. Officials from other health agencies promised Staley they would push the CDC, Staley said, but to little effect. “We got strung along.” The CDC finally  announced  it would allow commercial testing on 22 June – but the  tests  remain very difficult to get. The second failure was with the vaccines. There are two vaccines for monkeypox: the older one is designed for smallpox, but is known for dangerous side effects. The newer one, Jynneos, is a very effective two-shot vaccine developed in 2003 and manufactured by a small Danish company called Bavarian Nordic. But that shot is in short supply around the world. In early June, top officials assured Staley that the US had in place a stockpile of 1.2m doses of the vaccine, thanks to a Trump-era order by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda), the wing of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for managing the country’s vaccine reserves. The problem was most of those doses weren’t ready. Just 68,000 of the doses were already located in the US; the rest were in freezers in Denmark awaiting shipment. Worse, two-thirds of the doses in Denmark had been manufactured on a new factory line that the FDA hadn’t inspected – which meant the vaccines produced on it couldn’t be used, despite approvals from the FDA’s EU counterpart, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Activist groups held their fire based on private assurances that the vaccines were on their way, Staley says, but by late June, it was clear “the promises were obviously not true.” “If we had moved all 400,000 [FDA-approved doses] in June, we would have avoided a huge spread of monkeypox over Gay Pride,” he says. “All the cities would have had plenty of supply.” At the same time, the CDC began recommending the vaccine be used for post-exposure treatment of infected people instead of pre-exposure immunizations – which would reduce the number of doses needed. Staley compared the move to the agency’s guidance not to wear masks at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. “The CDC developed that policy because they were told we have very limited supplies. That’s the scandal. Everything is Covid 2.0.” “The most important response during any new epidemic is right upfront in the first weeks or months, or for something that spreads slowly like Aids, in the first few years,” says Staley. “You got to basically take a pillow and try to snuff out that epidemic right upfront so that you’re not dealing with something that’s huge within a few weeks or a few months or a few years.” But officials have fumbled that opportunity, he says. The CDC and the FDA did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Staley’s criticisms. On 7 July, the  FDA announced  that it had started inspecting the Bavarian Nordic plant. That day, Staley and PrEP4All members were finally able to hear from FDA official Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which inspects vaccine safety. But the exchange reminded Staley of meeting FDA staff as a protester in 1988. “We were hit by a wall of FDA arrogance, which it’s famous for: ‘This is how we do things, and this is why we do things, and you all don’t know how it works.’ They told us directly that they simply think that they are the best in the world at this and that the EMA is not quite there yet. And they won’t say why.” The exchange left him feeling angry and discouraged. “What’s more important, us feeling superior to the EMA or getting this vaccine here? There’s just nobody acting like this is a fucking emergency.” The US government is now working to expedite the shipment of vaccine doses from Denmark, and it is  reportedly reorganizing HHS  to elevate a department focused on pandemic and disaster response to the same level as the CDC and FDA. If all goes well, there should be as many as one million monkeypox vaccine doses in the United States within a month’s time. But that’s a big if. Staley says he’s still looking for clear answers, and that he has noticed his communication is “beginning to degrade with people at the top” as he’s stepped up his criticism. But if he has one regret, it’s that he and other activists didn’t blast them sooner. “We dropped the ball,” he tells me. “We just should have stayed in screaming mode every step of the way.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/22/peter-staley-monkeypox-response-us-interview"},

New York reached 1,040 cases as of Monday, said the most recent information released by the city. That accounts for about a quarter of all of the confirmed cases in the US. The US  leads the world  in confirmed cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). As of Monday, there were 3,846 confirmed cases in the US and 18,095 globally, the CDC said. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared the outbreak  a public health emergency on Saturday. The virus is spreading primarily among men who have sex with men, research has shown. Close sexual contact was responsible for transmission in 95% of cases,  one recent study found . There  is a divide  in New York City’s health department over whether the agency should advise gay men to change their sexual behavior amid the outbreak. Even as cases in New York have surged,  officials have struggled  to respond with adequate vaccination and testing. At the end of June, as New Yorkers scrambled to get a limited supply of monkeypox vaccines, there were 300,000 doses sitting in a warehouse in Denmark, the New York Times reported on Monday. Then, once officials decided to send those doses to the US, they arrived slowly, missing a chance to slow the spread of the virus. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, also announced on Monday that the state had  reached an agreement  with Quest Diagnostics to use a PCR test on people who have a rash consistent with monkeypox. “The real challenge with testing is that it involves swabbing lesions, which must be present for the test to assess whether the virus is also present,” the New York state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said in a statement. “Without lesions, testing is not currently possible. And we will continue working to make sure providers know when and how to test for monkeypox.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/more-than-1000-monkeypox-cases-confirmed-new-york-city"},
{"title": "Monkeypox declared disease of ‘national significance’ in Australia", "author": "Paul Karp", "date": "Thu 28 Jul 2022 04.01 BST", "text": "Australia has declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance” and has updated guidelines for who should get immunised ahead of newer vaccines being made available. On Thursday the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, revealed that there have been 44 cases of the disease in Australia, mostly in returned international travellers, people aged 21 to 40 years and men who have sex with men. Following  a declaration by the World Health Organisation earlier in July  labelling monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern, Australia declared it a communicable disease incident of “national significance”. The declaration means the response to monkeypox will have national coordination, in order to assist states and territories with outbreaks. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [Atagi] also updated its  clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox  to include the use of a MVA-BN vaccine named Jynneos to prepare for supplies arriving in Australia. “Limited supplies of … [MVA-BN Jynneos] have been secured by the commonwealth and some states and territories,” it said. It is unclear if these supplies have arrived in Australia, with demand high globally. The health minister, Mark Butler, told Guardian Australia earlier this week that the federal government had “been actively pursuing supplies of the third-generation vaccine MVA-BN well before the WHO declaration was made, recognising there is limited supply and significant global demand”. Health stakeholders believe an announcement of a supply deal for the newer vaccination is imminent. Monkeypox can also be prevented with a smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, which is registered for use in Australia and contained in the national medical stockpile, but that vaccine uses a weakened live pox virus called vaccinia, making it unsuitable for the immunocompromised. Jynneos has been recommended as the preferred vaccine, saying it can be administered to the immunocompromised, pregnant women, children and those with skin conditions. Heath Paynter, the deputy chief executive officer of the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations, said the government needs to “implement policies to arrest the virus and to prevent it becom[ing] endemic”. “Fundamental to this is to obtain a supply of vaccines for gay and bisexual men at risk of monkeypox,” he told Guardian Australia. “It is our expectation the government will acquire and supply MVA-BN, which is the only vaccine that is safe and effective.” “It is the only acceptable option,” he said, labelling ACAM2000 “inferior”. “Australia has a golden opportunity to step in and stop monkeypox in its tracks, but it could quickly evaporate, and once it does – it’s lost, as we’ve seen in Montreal, London, New York and Madrid, cities with hundreds of cases of community transmission.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Atagi advice states that “For healthy non-pregnant adults, where Jynneos is not suitable or not available, ACAM2000 has an established profile and may be considered” for those exposed to the virus or at high risk of exposure. In his update, Kelly said according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1 January to 28 July there had been 20,311 monkeypox cases in 71 countries that have not historically reported it, including Australia. The fact most cases have been in returned travellers indicates community transmission in Australia has been limited. Despite the declaration on Thursday, Kelly said it was important to note monkeypox “is far less harmful than Covid-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic”. Monkeypox is “far less transmissible” than Covid-19, he said. Monkeypox results in rashes and flu-like symptoms which Kelly said are “relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments”. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” he said. “The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people.” Kelly said since May the Department of Health had worked with at-risk communities, states and territories to ensure “our response to MPX [monkeypox] has been swift and coordinated”. The national medical stockpile has available stock of monkeypox treatments, such as antivirals, for states and territories to access on request, he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/monkeypox-declared-disease-of-national-significance-in-australia"},
{"title": "Monkeypox: WHO chief advises at-risk men to reduce number of sexual partners", "author": null, "date": "Wed 27 Jul 2022 18.15 BST", "text": "The head of the World Health Organization has advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”, after the UN agency declared escalating outbreaks in multiple countries  to be a global emergency . The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said 98% of the monkeypox cases detected since the outbreaks emerged in May had been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. He called for those at risk to take steps to protect themselves. “That means making safe choices for yourself and others, for men who have sex with men,” Tedros said. “This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners.” Infectious individuals should isolate and avoid gatherings involving close physical contact, while people should get contact details for any new sexual partners in case they needed to follow up later, the WHO chief said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not suggested that men who have sex with men reduce their sexual partners, only that they avoid skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that could be monkeypox. WHO officials emphasised that monkeypox could infect anyone in close contact with a patient or their contaminated clothing or bedsheets. The health agency has warned the disease could be more severe in vulnerable populations such as among children or pregnant women. More than 19,000 cases have been reported in more than 75 countries; deaths have only been reported in Africa. “We know very clearly that one of the main modes of exposure for this particular illness is through direct contact, close contact, skin-to-skin contact, possibly even face-to-face contact, exposure to droplets or virus that may be in the mouth,” Dr Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead for monkeypox, said. Andy Seale, a WHO adviser on HIV, hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections, said experts had determined the monkeypox outbreak was “clearly transmitted during sex”, but he said they had not yet concluded whether or not it was a sexually transmitted infection. Seale stressed that the messaging around the need for gay and bisexual men to reduce their number of sexual partners was “coming from the communities themselves”. But he said this was possibly only “a short-term message as we hope that the outbreak of course will be short-lived”. Dr Hugh Adler, who treats monkeypox patients in the UK, said the virus was being transmitted during sex and that sexual networks and anonymous sex with untraceable partners were facilitating its spread. “It’s just as likely that monkeypox was always capable of transmitting and presenting like this, but it hadn’t been formally reported or so widespread before,” he said. Last week British authorities issued new guidance advising doctors that people with just one or two lesions might be infectious with monkeypox, potentially complicating efforts to stop transmission. The European Union health commissioner urged the bloc’s 27 member nations on Wednesday to step up their efforts to tackle outbreaks in the EU, which she called “the epicentre of detected cases”. In a letter to European health ministers obtained by the Associated Press, Stella Kyriakides called for “reinforced, concerted and coordinated action”. “There is no time for complacency and we need to continue working together to control the outbreak,” she wrote.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/monkeypox-who-chief-advises-at-risk-men-reduce-number-sexual-partners"},

It is the seventh time such a declaration has been made since 2009, the most recent being for Covid-19, which was given  the same label by the WHO in 2020 , and follows a meeting of a committee of experts on Thursday. A public health emergency of international concern – or PHEIC – is defined by the WHO’s international health regulations as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. The UN health agency said the term implies the situation is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected, that it carries implications for public health beyond national borders, and that it may require immediate international attention. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said at a press conference that the committee met on Thursday to review the latest data, but that they were unable to reach a consensus. However, he has since decided to break the deadlock by declaring a PHEIC. “In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,” he said. “For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” While he said the risk of monkeypox was “moderate” globally, it was “high” in Europe and there was “a clear risk of further international spread”. Globally, there have so far been 16,016 monkeypox cases – 4,132 of which were in the past week, according to  WHO data . It is now in 75 countries and territories and there have been five deaths. The European region has the highest number of total cases, at 11,865, and the highest increase in the last seven days, with 2,705. Dr Rosamund Lewis, the technical lead for monkeypox at the WHO health emergencies programme, said: “There’s a lot of work to be done.” She said action must be taken to establish what causes risk and to reduce situations that could put people at risk so they can protect themselves. “This is how we will get to the end of this outbreak,” she said. Monkeypox is a viral infection  typically found in animals in central and western Africa, although it can cause outbreaks in humans. Cases are occasionally identified in countries where the virus is not endemic, but the latest outbreak has been unprecedented. While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico among others. The WHO said the outbreak was largely among men who have sex with men who had reported having sex recently with new or multiple partners. However, experts have stressed that anyone can get monkeypox as it is spread by close or intimate contact, with the  UN having warned that  some media portrayals of Africans and LGBTQ+ people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”. Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO emergencies programme, said: “We all know how difficult it has been historically to deal with issues like this because of stigma.” “If nothing else this is about enlightened self-interest,” he added, as well as “solidarity” with those affected.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/monkeypox-who-declares-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern"},

While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico, among others. Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in central and western Africa. Cases, usually small clusters or isolated infections, are sometimes diagnosed in other countries, including the UK where the  first case was recorded in 2018  in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria. There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo strain. The current international outbreak appears to involve the west African strain, although not all countries have released such information. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks. Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets. “Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.” Globally, there have so far been 16,016 monkeypox cases – 4,132 of which were in the past week, according to  WHO data .

The latest infection comes shortly after New Zealand’s first case, which was reported over the weekend, but the ministry of health said there was no evidence so far of community transmission. Worldwide, the World  Health  Organization (WHO) had reported 6,027 cases as of 7 July, with infections up 77% since the previous report on 27 June. Monkeypox is already  spreading in Australia , with 11 cases reported in New South Wales, but the largest outbreaks are in Europe, which accounts for 80-90% of current cases. According to the UK Health Security Agency,  there had been 1,552  confirmed cases of monkeypox as of 7 July – a figure that suggests  case numbers are doubling every 15 days . The WHO is due to meet by 18 July to consider whether monkeypox constitutes a global public health emergency. That designation – the highest level of global alert – applies only to Covid-19 and polio at present. According to  WHO guidelines , monkeypox symptoms are often mild, and usually last from two to four weeks. Severe cases can occur, however, and estimates of case fatality ratio range from less than 1% to 6%. The WHO has reported three deaths since the start of the year. A spokesperson for the ministry of health said the first case, a person in their 30s, lives in Auckland and had recently returned from overseas travel in a country with reported cases of monkeypox. The second case, also with a record of overseas travel, is isolating in the northern region. “We have already taken steps to prepare for the arrival of monkeypox. Last month monkeypox was officially listed as a notifiable disease, enabling us to utilise the tools needed to contain any possible spread of the disease including isolation orders and readying contact tracing capabilities,” the spokesperson said. While anyone can catch the virus through close contact, the outbreak in Europe so far has been clustered around men who have sex with men. According to the latest WHO update, more than 99% of the cases for which gender information was available were among men. “International cases have been clustered around events where this occurs,” the ministry spokesperson said. “As such we are asking anyone who’s been overseas and attended events connected with the spread of monkeypox to be aware of any symptoms and seek advice.” Smallpox vaccines offer protection against monkeypox, and in the US and UK governments are making plans to distribute vaccine doses to try to stem the spread and protect those most at risk. In New Zealand, the health ministry said it would “explore options for access to smallpox vaccines that can be used as part of the targeted prevention of spread of monkeypox in certain situations”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/12/new-zealand-reports-second-monkeypox-case-unrelated-to-first"},

The plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine – which has so far been limited – to prevent monkeypox in areas with the highest transmission and need. State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions’ ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised. The  Biden administration  will allocate 296,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories in the coming weeks, with 56,000 allocated immediately and 1.6m doses made available over the coming months, officials said. The United States has 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions. Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread. “As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials had been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox. The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of CDC’s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading. The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said.

The two cases of the viral disease were unrelated and were likely the result of household transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Friday. The agency said the children were in good health and being treated. Monkeypox, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, has been spreading largely in men who have sex with men in the recent outbreak, outside the central and west African countries where it is endemic. The disease spreads chiefly through close contact. So far this year, there have been more than 14,000 cases of monkeypox in more than 60 countries, and five deaths in Africa. Speaking on a conference call, Dr Jennifer McQuiston, the deputy director of the CDC’s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology, said it was not a surprise that pediatric cases of monkeypox had emerged, but “there is no evidence to date that we are seeing this virus spread outside” the communities of gay, bisexual and other men who had sex with men. She said 99% of the 2,891 monkeypox cases confirmed in the US involved men who have sex with men, but there had been a handful of women and transgender men who had become infected. The White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, speaking on the same call, said the government had delivered 300,000 doses of a monkeypox vaccine and was working to expedite the shipment from Denmark of 786,000 more doses. He said there was already enough vaccine on hand to provide a first vaccine dose to more than half of the eligible population in New York City and more than 70% of the eligible population in Washington DC. The fatality rate in previous outbreaks in Africa of the current strain has been about 1%, but so far this outbreak seems to be less lethal in the non-endemic countries. However, a number of patients have reported being hospitalised for severe pain.

The WHO label – a “ public health emergency of international concern ” – is designed to trigger a coordinated international response and could unlock funding to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments. On Sunday, the Biden administration’s Covid response coordinator, Ashish Jha, told CBS’s Face the Nation: “I applaud the WHO for declaring that public health emergency of international concern. “We are seeing outbreaks that are out of control in many, many parts of the world. It’s very important that we get our arms around this thing.” Monkeypox spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions. In  a first-person account for the Guardian , Sebastian Köhn, who contracted monkeypox in New York City, said: “I developed lesions literally everywhere. “They started out looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would eventually pop, then finally scab before leaving a scar. I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back, and five just on my right elbow. At the peak, I had over 50 lesions, a fever of 103F and intense pain, prompting a panic attack.” Tedros, who cast the deciding vote in favor of declaring a public health emergency of international concern, said the risk of monkeypox was moderate globally, except in Europe, where the WHO has deemed the risk to be high. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Tedros said: “Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.” He added: “Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.” Jha said: “In the US right now, we’re looking at public health emergency as something [the health department] might … invoke but it really depends on what does that allow us to do. “Right now we have over 2,000 cases, but we have ramped up vaccinations, ramped up treatments, ramped up testing, and we’re going to continue to look at all sort of policy options. Right now, we think we can get our arms around this thing but obviously if we need further tools we will invoke them as we need them.” Schiff and other prominent critics have called for more access to testing and vaccines, amid claims the US was caught flat-footed. Jha said: “What I would acknowledge is that when we started two months ago, we had a limited supply of vaccines. We have obtained more than any other country, probably more than every other country combined. We have acted swiftly. We’ve gotten 800,000 doses from Denmark … just in the last week. “We’re going to be getting those out in the upcoming couple of weeks. So what I would say is this is a virus that we have known for, you know, 60 years, we had the vaccine and diagnostic capabilities to manage it. But, we have substantially ramped up that response, and that is now I think being felt in localities around the country.” Schiff appeared on the same show. His host, Margaret Brennan, said: “You said the federal response falls short in terms of supply and timeliness, regarding a vaccine. The current supply accounts for only three and a half million residents. Some shipments are not even expected to arrive until 2023. Why do you think the federal response is failing when Dr Jha says it’s contained and under control? Schiff said: “I don’t know why there aren’t more vaccines available. I’m hearing from healthcare providers in my district that there are people lining up to get vaccinated and they don’t have the vaccines for them, and that is a real problem. “We really don’t know the future course of this virus. But what we do now, early on, just as was the case with the [Covid] pandemic, will determine just how bad this may get. “And so I want to light a fire under the administration and get them to make sure that we up production, that we up distribution and that people that are ready and willing and able to get vaccinated have the ability to protect themselves.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/monkeypox-schiff-us-vaccines"},

According to Kluge, more than 90% of confirmed cases in the latest outbreak have been in the Europe region, with cases reported in 31 countries and areas. He said confirmed cases across the region had more than tripled since 15 June, reaching more than 4,500. Most cases for which information is available have been in men who have sex with men, although some have been identified in other demographics, including in children. Last week it was disclosed that the outbreak would not yet be classed as a public health emergency of international concern, but Kluge said the committee involved would revisit its position shortly. The label was used for Covid-19, which declared a PHEIC by the WHO on  30 January 2020 . “In the meantime, WHO continues to assess the risk of monkeypox in the European region as high,” he said. While Kluge said no confirmed cases had died, 10% have been hospitalised for treatment or for isolation purposes, and one had been admitted to an intensive care unit. “There is simply no room for complacency, especially right here in the European region with its fast-moving outbreak that with every hour, day and week is extending its reach into previously unaffected areas,” he said, adding the stigmatisation of men who have sex with men in some countries was compounding the challenge. Data from the  UK Health Security Agency  released on Friday showed that as of Thursday, there had been 1,235 confirmed cases in the UK, up from 1,076 confirmed by last Sunday. Dr Sophia Makki, an incident director at UKHSA, urged people participating in Pride events on Saturday to check for blister-like spots and rashes. “If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested,” she said. “Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks, especially if you are having sex with someone new. To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/no-room-for-complacency-over-monkeypox-says-who"},
{"title": "Efforts to curb UK monkeypox outbreak inadequate, warn experts", "author": "Nicola Davis", "date": "Mon 11 Jul 2022 16.19 BST", "text": "Monkeypox is continuing to spread in the UK, with current efforts insufficient to curb the outbreak, experts have warned as a whistleblower claimed there were serious flaws in the support given to those who think they have been exposed. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA),  there have been 1,552  confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK related to the outbreak as of 7 July. While anyone can catch the virus as it is spread through close or intimate contact, the majority of cases so far have been among gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Within England, the majority of cases have been in London. There is little sign of infections fizzling out, with the latest estimates from UKHSA suggesting  case numbers are doubling every 15 days . “[There is] no evidence that current strategies are likely to bring this to an end anytime soon,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, although he noted that while total case numbers were continuing to rise, the rate of new infections may have plateaued. The concerns came as a whistleblower working on a UKHSA monkeypox inquiries line said it had numerous issues, including offering little support for people who are not confirmed contacts of cases – ie somebody whose name has been provided to contact tracers by a person with monkeypox.  The Guardian has seen scripts that show even if someone calls because they are worried they may have had a contact with a confirmed case, they are told their risk is very low if they have not been formally identified as a contact. The whistleblower said that made little sense when a caller has said a sexual partner has monkeypox symptoms. In addition, the whistleblower said call handlers were not allowed to suggest callers contact a sexual health clinic unless sexual health was brought up by the caller, They added that some clinics had turned off their phone lines. The UKHSA has rejected the claims, saying the phone line is an additional service to provide non-clinical advice to members of the public. Dr William Welfare, the agency’s incident director, said specialist public health teams were rapidly following up all cases to limit transmission, with contacts assessed as high risk offered vaccination. “Contact tracing has often relied on people sharing contacts for a high number of sexual contacts, so can inevitably be difficult when also taking into account confidentiality. We have rapidly implemented a high-quality public health operation with sexual health services to investigate and control monkeypox, and to support those affected,” Welfare said. “Monkeypox is predominantly being spread by very close contact, most prominently through relatively closed sexual networks, and has not been found routinely in the wider population. The prevalence of infection overall in the UK and therefore the risk to the general public currently remains low.” Vaccination involves a smallpox jab that also offers protection against monkeypox. The UKHSA  recently announced it would broaden eligibility for vaccination  to include some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to the virus even if they were not a confirmed close contact of a case. The UKHSA confirmed there was a ready supply of vaccine, with almost 30,000 doses procured, but said the NHS had yet to announce plans for the rollout of the jab. A NHS spokesperson, said: “The NHS is working with local partners to identify and invite those who are eligible for a vaccination to come forward, and over the coming weeks will rapidly grow the number of clinics to make it as quick and convenient as possible to get vaccinated. “Following UKHSA advice, the NHS will continue to prioritise vaccination for those at greater risk, including healthcare workers in specialist roles and clinics where exposure to Monkeypox is highest.” But Hunter said an even broader approach may be needed. “I think wider vaccination of high-risk MSM – people who have frequent multiple contacts – and maybe female sex workers are the way forward,” he said. “We may not have enough vaccine to do this but I think there could be a case to offer vaccine to everyone attending an STD [sexually transmitted diseases] clinic.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/11/efforts-to-curb-uk-monkeypox-outbreak-inadequate-warn-experts-whistleblower-claim-helpline"},
{"title": "UK monkeypox outbreak not yet under control, say experts", "author": "Nicola Davis", "date": "Sun 19 Jun 2022 09.58 BST", "text": "The monkeypox outbreak in the UK is not yet under control, experts have warned, with some suggesting that vaccines may need to be offered to all men who have sex with men. Monkeypox,  which is to be given a new name  by the World Health Organization (WHO), is typically found in west and central Africa, but an unprecedented outbreak in recent weeks has resulted in cases appearing in a host of countries from France to Canada and Australia. It is understood the WHO will hold a meeting next week to decide whether to label the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. As of 12 June, 470 cases had been identified in the UK, including a rise of 104 cases reported in England  last Monday . Experts are warning further action may be needed to curb the rise. “At the moment there is no clear evidence that the current epidemic is coming under control,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. Cases so far have predominately been found among men who are gay or bisexual or otherwise have sex with men – although experts have raised concerns around particular communities becoming stigmatised, stressing anyone can get monkeypox and that it is spread between humans through close contact. A smallpox vaccine that also offers protection against monkeypox is available, with current guidelines advising jabs should ideally be given to close contacts of cases within four days of exposure to monkeypox to prevent or lessen the impact of infection, although in some circumstances it can be  given to individuals up to 14 days after exposure  to reduce symptoms should infection have occurred. “I guess that if we do not see this coming under control very soon, then we are looking at offering vaccination to all men who have sex with men, and possibly female sex workers,” said Hunter. Prof Jimmy Whitworth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine also raised concerns. “These numbers of new cases suggest that we are not yet getting the monkeypox epidemic under control,” he said, although he cautioned it was necessary to look at the trend in cases over a longer period, while it could take a week or two before the number of new cases fell once transmission was under control.  But Whitworth said it was clearly a very challenging outbreak to control. “There seem to have been some superspreading events that have enabled infections to spread rapidly into many different countries, and there are chains of transmission that suggest that there might have been some cases without any obvious signs of infection which has allowed further spread which has not been detected,” he said.  Hunter said there were probably many factors at play. “The thing that worries me the most is that for a disease whose transmission may have significant stigma for some is that people may not be fully honest about their contacts and if that is the case then a public education and a ring vaccination strategy approach may not be sufficient,” he said, adding another concern was how well contacts were adhering to the self-isolation period. “For someone who is not openly gay having to self-isolate for 21 days would be tantamount to coming out,” Hunter said, noting the situation was sensitive and complex, particularly for bisexual men who have not come out to their female partners. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), individuals who have been tested are usually informed of their result within 24 hours, with contacts identified and followed up with as soon as possible, and vaccination offered if appropriate. However, the agency  has flagged challenges with the outbreak,  noting: “Most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners, sometimes in the context of cruising grounds or during chemsex, frequently where contact details were unavailable for tracing.” Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said public health teams in the UK and internationally had done an excellent job, both with contact tracing and reporting as well as accurate and sensitive public health messaging. Head said there was a small signal in UK data that the outbreak was slowing down – although this was not yet certain – while the lack of infections within the wider community showed transmission relied on very close contact.  “This is less complex to address than, for example, a Covid-19 outbreak, and gives encouragement that the outbreak will be brought to an end in the coming weeks or months,” he said. Dr Hugh Adler of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said there could be a positive view of the rising case numbers. “Maybe this is [reflecting] that the public health messaging is getting out and people are presenting for assessment,” he said. Adler said vaccination was not appropriate for all contacts of cases, particularly if they did not have close or intimate contact. Instead such individuals can be monitored for possible symptoms. “Their risk is so low that vaccination wouldn’t be the right thing for them anyway, because of our limited supplies of the vaccine, as well as side-effects,” he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/uk-monkeypox-outbreak-not-yet-under-control-say-experts"},
{"title": "UK orders more doses of monkeypox vaccine as cases pass 2,000", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Tue 19 Jul 2022 18.42 BST", "text": "Public health officials have ordered 100,000 more doses of vaccine to help curb the spread of monkeypox as the number of UK cases rose to more than 2,000 in the months-long outbreak. According to figures released by the  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) on Tuesday, confirmed cases have risen to 2,137 in the UK, with 2,050 recorded in England. The majority of infections are in London and among men who have sex with men. Despite the continued growth in cases, health officials have revised their guidance for close contacts of confirmed monkeypox cases, no longer requiring them to isolate at home if they do not have symptoms of the disease. The decision was made in light of new data that showed only a small number of close contacts of confirmed cases have gone on to develop monkeypox, and a lack of evidence for transmission beyond intimate or sexual contact, the UKHSA said. Further doses of the Imvanex smallpox vaccine, which is effective against monkeypox, are due to arrive from the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, this month, and more are expected by September. The NHS is contacting people eligible for the vaccine, including men who are more likely to catch the virus. “We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow,” said Dr Merav Kliner, a deputy incident director at the UKHSA. “Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms.” While the advice was changing, Kliner said, monkeypox remains a “serious public health challenge” and she urged contacts of confirmed cases to “take a break from any activities or events involving skin-to-skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing, to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly”. She urged people to stay alert to the symptoms of monkeypox and call a sexual health clinic if they become unwell. Early symptoms of monkeypox include a high temperature, headache, muscle aches and swollen glands. A rash or blisters usually appear, which can then spread around the body. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: “Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/19/uk-orders-more-doses-of-monkeypox-vaccine-as-cases-pass-2000"},

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC), was activated on Tuesday to boost operational support for addressing a monkeypox outbreak. For reference, the EOC was  activated for Covid-19  in January 2020, on the same day as the first coronavirus case was  detected  in the US. “The EOC activation is helping to further supplement the ongoing work of CDC staff to respond to this outbreak,” said Scott Pauley, a press officer with CDC. “Clinicians and public health departments already reach out to CDC to report and investigate monkeypox cases,” he added. There are currently 300 CDC staff members working on monkeypox with local and state-level medical personnel, and the EOC is expected to enhance those measures. As of Monday, CDC recorded  306 cases  of monkeypox across 28 states, with the highest numbers in California and New York, respectively. Currently, there are 66 cases in California, 63 in New York, and 45 in Illinois. The other states, for the most part, have fewer than 10 cases reported. Epidemiologist and health economist Dr Eric Feigl-Ding  noted  on Tuesday that the expected number of monkeypox cases by August is 100,000 worldwide, and urged the World Health Organization to take action. Earlier, on Sunday, WHO said while the global rate of the monkeypox spread is alarming, it  does not  yet raise alarms for a global emergency. On Monday, the White House  announced  that the administration is allocating nearly 300,000 vaccine doses, with an estimated 1.6m doses available over the next few months.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/cdc-emergency-operations-unit-monkeypox"},
{"title": "‘It’s taken so long’: Monkeypox patients raise concerns over UK tracing delays", "author": "Nicola Davis", "date": "Sun 19 Jun 2022 10.31 BST", "text": "With the  monkeypox outbreak continuing in the UK , some of those affected have raised concerns over delays and difficulties in contact tracing and vaccination. Joel* told the Guardian he had sought advice on testing and vaccination after becoming aware a close contact had been exposed to monkeypox and had developed symptoms. However, Joel said he struggled to access testing in London over the jubilee bank holiday and was turned down for a vaccine, initially being told it was only available to healthcare staff. Joel was subsequently confirmed as a close contact of a monkeypox case by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and was told he should have been offered the vaccine. However the delay meant he was no longer eligible for the jab. Current guidelines suggest the vaccine should ideally be given within four days of exposure to prevent or lessen the impact of infection, although it can be given to high-risk individuals  up to 14 days after exposure  to reduce symptoms. Joel said the process had caused him anxiety, noting one concern in the community was whether monkeypox could leave those infected with permanent scars, adding that with LGBT events that include anonymous sex continuing to go ahead it seemed likely monkeypox would keep spreading. “It has taken so long for [public health bodies] to trace [close contacts] that they are going to have to get out and effectively proactively vaccinate a lot of at-risk groups to stop this,” he said. Joel said he was initially told to self-isolate for 21 days but was unable to do so for financial and mental health reasons, noting he was self-employed and, in addition, did not wish those he worked with to know he was bisexual. He has subsequently tested positive for monkeypox, and has been asked to self-isolate until all scabs drop off. According to the UKHSA, individuals who have been tested are usually informed of their result within 24 hours, with contacts identified and followed up with as soon as possible, and vaccination offered if appropriate. However, the agency itself  has flagged challenges , “as most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners, sometimes in the context of cruising grounds or during chemsex, frequently where contact details were unavailable for tracing”. Matt*, who also lives in London, said he had had sex with a man who later contacted him to say he was experiencing symptoms and had been in contact with a confirmed case. When Matt rang 111, he was advised to isolate for 21 days but was not offered a vaccine because his contact was yet to be tested and confirmed as a case. “Desperate” to get the vaccine before he potentially started experiencing severe symptoms, he told a contact tracer he had been in touch with the confirmed case and was vaccinated five days after the sexual encounter took place. By the time he was tested three days later, he had five lesions. “The doctor said I had one of the mildest cases he’d ever seen, and when I said I’d had the vaccine, he said that was probably why,” said Matt. But while he was not critical of the response from healthcare staff, who he said were “doing their best with a limited number of doses”, he said he thought the UKHSA’s public messaging around the disease needed to change. “They don’t seem to be taking into account how quickly it can spread within networks of gay men where people have lots and lots of sexual partners,” he said. Adding that prior to being infected he could have up to 20 sexual partners a week, Matt noted that within spaces such as saunas or “cruise bars” few people exchange details. “If you tell people off too much, they’ll just ignore it. But one thing they could say is, if you’re going to carry on having sex with lots of people, get their phone number so one of you can contact the other,” he said. “It’s a short-term change that seems like it would make a lot of sense.” The UKHSA told the Guardian that in addition to mandatory sick pay, in special circumstances, local authorities may grant discretionary payments to those isolating to mitigate community transmission of a high-consequence infectious disease. The agency said vaccines were offered on a case-by-case basis. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “A decision on whether or not to offer a vaccine to a close contact of a confirmed monkeypox case is a clinical one made by trained health protection teams who carry out detailed assessments of each case. This includes the specific details of the exposure and the individual’s risk level. Currently, the Imvanex vaccine is only offered to close contacts with higher risk exposure, and decisions are taken on a case by case basis.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/monkeypox-patients-raise-concerns-uk-tracing-delays"},
{"title": "WHO to rename monkeypox virus to avoid discrimination", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Wed 15 Jun 2022 14.20 BST", "text": "The  World Health Organization  has said it will rename monkeypox to avoid discrimination and stigmatisation as the virus continues to spread among people in an unprecedented global outbreak of the disease. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said the organisation was “working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of the monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes”. The move comes after scientists  called for an “urgent” change to the name  which they described as “inaccurate”, “discriminatory” and “stigmatising” in a report released last week. An announcement on the new name would be made “as soon as possible”, said Tedros. Similar concerns were raised at the height of the coronavirus pandemic when new Covid variants were named after the countries or regions where they were first detected, leading to travel bans and other restrictions. In response, the WHO brought in a naming system that referred to new variants as letters of the Greek alphabet. In the report, the scientists raise concerns that the “prevailing perception” in the media and scientific literature is that monkeypox virus is endemic in humans in some African countries, whereas the virus is overwhelmingly found in animals, which have historically sparked occasional outbreaks when they infect people. The scientists warn of “an increasing narrative in the media and among many scientists that are trying to link the present global outbreak to Africa or west Africa, or Nigeria”. While the UK  Health  Security Agency first raised the alarm after a person with monkeypox arrived in London from Nigeria on 4 May, the virus had already been spreading for some time, predominantly among men who have sex with men. The WHO currently refers to two types of monkeypox, namely the “west African” and the “Congo basin (central African)” clades. This year’s outbreak is driven by the former type, which is substantially less dangerous than the latter. “In the context of the current global outbreak, continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising,” the experts write. They go on to criticise the use of photos of African patients with pox lesions in coverage of the outbreak in the global north. In the report, the scientists use the name “hMPXV” for human monkeypox virus as a placeholder to distinguish the virus driving the current international outbreak in humans from the virus most commonly found in animals. On Wednesday, the WHO’s Europe director, Dr Hans Kluge, said the magnitude of the outbreak “poses a real risk”, telling a media briefing: “The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach and the stronger the disease’s foothold will get in non-endemic countries. He called on “governments, health partners and civil society” to “act with urgency” to “control this outbreak”. At the same briefing, Steve Taylor, a board member at European Pride, said LGBTQ+ events must not be closed down in light of the outbreak, but instead used to spread public health messages about monkeypox. He said about 750 Pride events were due to take place in Europe this summer. “We have been working with the WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves,” he said. “Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. “We are pleased the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging,” he added. The UKHSA announced 52 more cases of monkeypox in England on Wednesday, one more in Scotland and a further case in Wales, bringing the UK total to 524 as of 14 June. More than 1,800 cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in dozens of countries outside Africa in the latest outbreak. The UKHSA urged people to contact a sexual health clinic if they developed a rash with blisters and they had been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have had monkeypox in the past three weeks, or had been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks. The WHO will convene an emergency meeting of experts on monkeypox next week to advise on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, meaning it requires a coordinated response.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/15/who-to-rename-monkeypox-virus-to-avoid-discrimination"},
{"title": "Monkeypox vaccines rolled out more widely in UK as cases near 800", "author": "Nicola Davis", "date": "Tue 21 Jun 2022 18.04 BST", "text": "Vaccines will be offered more widely to people at higher risk of getting monkeypox, in an attempt to help control the unprecedented outbreak in the UK. Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)  reveals that up to 20 June  there were 793 laboratory-confirmed cases in the UK, up from 574 on 16 June – a 38% rise in just four days. While anyone can catch the virus as it is spread between humans through close contact, the UKHSA states that most cases have occurred in men who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with men. Now the UKHSA says it is broadening eligibility for vaccination, saying it will begin offering jabs to some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox, even if they are not a confirmed contact of a case. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said it is hoped the move will help to control the outbreak. “Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak,” she said. The UK has secured thousands of doses of a smallpox vaccine, a jab that also offers protection against monkeypox. Initially the vaccine was only offered pre-exposure to healthcare workers, and to contacts of cases at high risk of infection – with it ideally given to the latter within four days of exposure, although in some circumstances it can be  given up to 14 days after . However, the Guardian has previously reported that some contacts of cases have experienced  difficulties and delays in accessing vaccination . Experts have also raised concerns, with  some saying the outbreak is not under control  and vaccines may need to be offered to all men who have sex with men to combat the spread of the virus. Among other factors, some have noted that stigma around monkeypox may be making contact tracing difficult, while the UKHSA has also highlighted challenges including that contact details are not always available for tracing those who may have been exposed. While details have not yet been released about exactly who is now eligible for the jab, the UKHSA said a number of factors would be involved in the criteria, suggesting vaccination may be advised, for example, for someone who participates in group sex. “Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet,” said Ramsay. “In the meantime, everyone should continue to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they’ve had close contact with a new partner,” she said. “If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending.” Robbie de Santos, director of communications and external affairs at Stonewall, welcomed the shift in strategy. “It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others. Let’s help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy Pride season,” he said. The jabs will also be made more widely available pre-exposure to workers in laboratories where pox viruses are being handled, as well as a broader range of healthcare staff.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/21/monkeypox-vaccines-uk-cases-near-800"},
{"title": "Fears two monkeypox cases were transmitted locally and could mark spread of disease in Australia", "author": null, "date": null, "text": "Monkeypox may be spreading in Australia after  New South Wales  found infections among the state’s 11 confirmed cases that could have been transmitted locally. NSW  Health  says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. “People need to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, which can include fever, headache, body aches and a rash or lesions on the genital area,” NSW Health executive director of health protection Jeremy McAnulty said on Wednesday. He said the cases had not exhibited severe symptoms, such as an extensive rash or lesions all over the body. But McAnulty warned even minor symptoms such as pimples in the genital area or buttocks needed to be taken seriously. “The virus is mainly spread through skin-to-skin contact … It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity.” Monkeypox occurs mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in humans in 1970. The illness can be transmitted from person to person through air droplets, close bodily contact or sharing contaminated linens or objects. Australia has joined a growing list of nations affected by the rare tropical illness including Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and the UK. There is no room for complacency around the current outbreak, the  World Health Organization  said earlier this month, noting cases in Europe tripled in just over two weeks, with some infections identified in children. In a statement on 1 July,  Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe , called on governments and the public to increase efforts to prevent the disease from extending its geographical reach. “Urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease,” he said. According to Kluge, more than 90% of confirmed cases in the latest outbreak have been in the Europe region, with cases reported in 31 countries and areas. He said confirmed cases in the area had more than tripled since 15 June, reaching more than 4,500.

{"title": "Majority of UK’s 366 monkeypox cases are in London, says health agency", "author": "Denis Campbell", "date": "Fri 10 Jun 2022 20.42 BST", "text": "Four-fifths of the people in England who have been infected with monkeypox live in London, an  investigation  by the UK Health Security Agency has found. Of the cases interviewed, 99% of those infected are men and their median age is 38, the agency added after analysing 336 of the 366 confirmed cases found in the UK since the outbreak began last month. The same overwhelming majority of cases – 99% – involve men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men, the UKHSA said. Interviews it has conducted with 45 men with monkeypox specifically about their sexual health found that 44% had visited “sex-on-premises venues” in the UK or abroad, such as saunas, sex clubs and dark rooms, while they were incubating the infection. In addition, 64% had met new sexual partners during their incubation period through a dating app. Incubation lasts anywhere between five and 21 days. Tracing all the sexual partners of men who have contracted monkeypox will be hard, the UKHSA admitted, as “most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners … where contact details were unavailable for tracing”. The UKHSA report is based on close scrutiny of the history of the 336 laboratory-confirmed cases that had been identified in the UK by 8 June, including detailed questionnaires that 152 cases filled in. That total rose to 366 on Friday. “A high proportion of England cases were known to be  London  residents”, it said, adding that 224 of 276 people for whom they had a home address lived in the capital. In terms of their sex, 311 of 314 confirmed cases were men, with three women. The UKHSA said the median age of those infected was 38, though that was based on analysis of the middle half of all those affected, who were aged between 32 and 44. “Findings show that monkeypox is being transmitted in geographically diffuse sexual networks”, the report added. Among the 45 interviewed 98% had had sex with other men during the incubation period. In that group 60% had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection during the previous year, 44% had had more than ten sexual partners in the preceding three months and the same proportion had taken part in group sex while the infection was incubating. “Sexual networks involved in this outbreak are interconnected both within and without the UK”, the UKHSA said. Among the 45 cases, 30% had had sex in a city outside their usual place of residence, 20% had taken part in sexual activity abroad and 24% had had sex with men who were not UK residents. Health officials hope that sex-on-premises venues will agree to implement “targeted interventions [which] would support outbreak control”, to try to reduce the risk of further transmission of the monkeypox virus. The agency’s “early evidence and preliminary analyses” also say that the number of detected cases so far means that the outbreak in England is at level 2 of four levels. That is defined as “transmission within a defined sub-population with high numbers of close contacts”. However, with numbers rising, officials are monitoring it for signs that it has reached level 3 – “transmission within multiple sub-populations or larger sub-population”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/majority-of-uks-monkeypox-cases-are-in-london-says-health-agency"},

We don’t know the scope and the potential of it yet, but we have to act like it will have the capability of spreading much more widely than it’s spreading right now,”  Anthony Fauci , Joe Biden’s top medical adviser,  said  on CNN this weekend. Scott Gottlieb , the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, told CBS’s Face the Nation: “I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. And, if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close.” There were 1,814 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the US as of Friday afternoon,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Fauci and Gottlieb both expressed their belief that the actual numbers were higher – and stressed the need for testing. Fauci said the data was “very likely an undercount”. He told CNN: “Whenever you have the emergence of something like this, you are always probably looking at what might be, might be, we don’t know, the tip of the iceberg, so that’s the reason why we’ve got to get the testing out there in a much, much more vigorous way.” Gottlieb said that the authorities are probably detecting “just a fraction” of cases. “We had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested and by and large, we’re looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics… But it’s a fact that there’s cases outside that community right now. We’re not picking them up because we’re not looking there,” Gottlieb said. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted virus; it spreads “through close, physical contact between individuals”, according to the  New York state health department , which added: “This means anyone can get monkeypox. However, based on the current outbreak, certain populations are being affected by monkeypox more than others, including men who have sex with men.” More than 132,000 doses of  vaccine against monkeypox  have been taken out of the US strategic stockpile and sent across the country, but health authorities estimate that more than 1.5 million US residents qualify for this two-dose vaccination,  according to CNN . The US has ordered almost 7 million doses, but the majority will not arrive for months, leaving many at risk, Forbes  reported . New York City, for example, “does not have sufficient vaccine supply to reach the number of people who need it [to] protect themselves”, health department officials  said  Friday. The city has now seen 461 cases of monkeypox, as the location of the greatest number of confirmed US cases. Monkeypox patients have described numerous barriers in accessing care. Gabriel Morales  told  the New York Times that it took him nine hours of inquiries just to secure a test. After Morales returned home, he never received a phone call with his results and worked to obtain antiviral treatment and pain medication. “It was just the worst pain I’ve experienced in my life,” Morales told the newspaper.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/monkeypox-vaccines-testing-us-latest-warning-threat"},

According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), 77 more cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK, 73 of which are in England and two each in Scotland and Wales. The figures bring the total identified in the UK, as of 5 June, to 302, with 287 in England, 10 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and three in Wales. Typically found in central and west Africa, monkeypox has cropped up in recent months in myriad countries where it is not endemic, including the UK, Australia, France, Canada and Israel. While it appears the current outbreak involves the west Africa strain of the virus, which is less serious than the Congo strain, the situation has caused concern given both the number of cases involved, and evidence of community spread. The UKHSA reiterated that, at present, “most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men”, although the agency stressed that anyone could catch monkeypox, particularly if they have close contact with a symptomatic person. Last month  the United Nations’ Aids agency raised concerns  that the LGBTI community could experience stigma as a result of some of the media portrayals of cases that it has called “racist and homophobic”. Most people shrug off the virus after a few weeks, but monkeypox can pose a greater risk to pregnant people, children and those with weakened immune systems. Among the symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and a rash with blisters. The UKHSA reiterated on Monday that anyone who has developed such a rash and has either returned from west or central Africa or been a close contact of a confirmed or suspected monkeypox case in the past three weeks should contact a sexual health clinic. However, experts, while concerned, have stressed that the risk for the general public remains low. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about,”  said Dr Sylvie Briand , the WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief, on 28 May. “It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/uk-records-77-more-cases-of-monkeypox-taking-total-to-302"},

More than 1,000 monkeypox cases have been reported in at least  29 countries  and every continent except Antarctica as of Monday. The US has seen 31 cases of the virus in  13 states , including seven in New York and six in California. Many of the infected had not recently travelled to the areas of Africa where monkeypox usually occurs, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other parts of central and western Africa, the CDC said. Some of the cases involved people living with an infected person. Investigators have been examining whether at least some cases in the current outbreak may be spreading through sexual contact. The CDC urged travelers to avoid close contact with sick people – especially those with lesions on their skin or genitals – and their bedding or clothes. Others with whom to avoid contact included dead or live rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes, since the virus that causes monkeypox often comes from rodents and primates. The CDC also cautioned against eating or preparing meat from wild game, known as bushmeat, or using creams, lotions or powders derived from animals in Africa. “Risk to the general public is low,” the CDC said. “But you should seek medical care immediately if you develop new, unexplained skin rash (lesions on any part of the body), with or without fever and chills, and avoid contact with others.” At one point on Monday  the CDC  told travelers to “wear a mask” as it “can help protect you from many diseases, including monkeypox”, according to a screenshot posted on Twitter by epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, but the recommendation no longer appeared on the CDC’s website on Tuesday. The monkeypox virus does not spread easily between people, though transmission can occur through contact with an infected person’s body fluids, sores, contaminated bedding and clothes, and respiratory droplets during face-to-face contact. The virus has a slow incubation period, and those exposed to it can be given existing smallpox vaccines to limit severity of any sickness.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/monkeypox-cases-cdc-alert-level-us"},

The virus is typically found in central and western Africa. However, in recent weeks cases have been identified in myriad countries around the world where it is not endemic, with experts voicing concerns over the number of cases and evidence that it is spreading in the community. At present it appears the outbreak involves the milder west African strain of monkeypox rather than the more serious Congo strain. However, while the virus is typically shrugged off by most people in a matter of weeks, people who have weakened immune systems, who are pregnant, or who are children are at greater risk from monkeypox. The rise in confirmed cases in the England from 348 as of 9 June to 452 as of 12 June marks the largest uptick in cases in the country to date, with an average over the three-day period of almost 35 cases a day. The UKHSA added that to date, the majority of cases had been in men who were gay, bisexual or had sex with men. However, the agency stressed that anyone could get monkeypox, noting it is spread by close contact. On Friday the UKHSA released a technical document  revealing that the outbreak was currently at the second of four levels of transmission, meaning spread of monkeypox was “within a defined sub-population with high number of close contacts”. The report added that the majority of cases were in London and among men, with most cases identified in people who had not recently travelled to a country where monkeypox was endemic. The UKHSA has continued to urge people to contact a sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have had close contact in the past three weeks with someone who either has or may have monkeypox. People with such a rash who have been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks should also contact a sexual health clinic, the agency advised. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “The public health teams in the UK and internationally have done an excellent job, not just with the contact tracing and reporting, but also with accurate and sensitive public health messaging.

This positive test was revealed the same day the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reported  that there have been a total of 21 confirmed monkeypox cases across the US in 2022. As of late Thursday afternoon, the CDC  reported  there were 790 confirmed cases in 28 countries. These monkeypox cases have emerged as the world continues to reel from the Covid-19  pandemic , which has killed more than 6 million globally, with 1 million fatalities in the US since 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University  data . New York City health authorities have noted that the likelihood of contracting monkeypox remains low, but that protective actions could be taken. “Monkeypox is rare in New York City but we can prevent the spread,” the health department said. Health officials noted that monkeypox is spread through “direct contact” with an infected animal or person, and that human-to-human spread is unlikely, usually taking place due to “open sores, body fluids or large respiratory droplets”. Sexual activity and talking closely are among the ways monkeypox might be transmitted, they said. The means of preventing monkeypox are similar to protective measures against Covid-19, such as masking around others and washing hands, as well as avoiding contact with people who might have monkeypox, officials said. Rosamund Lewis, the World Health Organization’s monkeypox technical lead, has said it is unclear how long the virus has proliferated outside the several African countries where it’s endemic. “We don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain,” Lewis said,  according to CNBC . “What the WHO and all member states are trying to do is prevent onward spread.” Several public health experts told the Guardian that monkeypox is not poised to become a pandemic like Covid, given the virus’s characteristics. “It’s a slower-moving picture than we see with Covid. First of all, the incubation period is longer, time between generations is greater,” said Brian Labus, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Public Health. “Second, it doesn’t spread as easily and third, we don’t see asymptomatic cases. With Covid, that’s always the challenge – you have people who are spreading it and don’t even know it. “If you get infected, you get the disease,” Labus said. “We’re talking about an illness that causes a problem with your skin. It’s a pox virus. It causes pustules on your skin.” Jessica Justman, associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, said: “My own stance in all of this is: I’m paying attention, and I think that’s what I would communicate to others – I certainly don’t think we need to panic.” Justman noted that epidemiologists and other public health professionals had an understanding of monkeypox, including their experience studying the virus in countries where it is endemic. “It does not cause enormous numbers of disease there,” Justman said. And while many fewer people are vaccinated against smallpox than in years prior, large numbers of older adults were vaccinated, which may convey some protection against monkeypox, Justman explained. “I wouldn’t put it in the category that we should all be actively worried about this,” Justman also said, adding, “Let’s all pay attention and see how this is evolving.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/monkeypox-cases-new-york-city-cdc"},
{"title": "Monkeypox may have been circulating in UK for years, scientists say", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Wed 25 May 2022 17.34 BST", "text": "Public health officials have confirmed seven more cases of monkeypox in England, bringing the UK total to 78, as scientists said the virus may have been circulating unseen for several years. The sudden surge in monkeypox, which is usually found in west and central Africa, has been recorded in at least 20 countries in the past month, with more than 200 confirmed cases and dozens more under investigation. It is the first time the disease has spread in the community outside Africa, with all previous cases associated with travel to regions where the virus is endemic or to imported animals harbouring the virus. The largest number of confirmed cases are in the UK, where health protection teams are isolating people who test positive and their closest contacts and offering smallpox vaccinations, which are cross-protective against monkeypox. A substantial proportion of cases are among men who have sex with men (MSM). As efforts continue to contain the outbreak, scientists are working through how the disease came to flare up in so many countries in such a short space of time. Many suspect that monkeypox was circulating at low levels, undetected, in the UK or Europe for several years before it reached the MSM community and flared up. Prof David Heymann, who chairs a World  Health  Organization expert group on infectious threats to global health, said it was possible the virus entered the UK two or three years ago and spread under the radar. Between 2018 and 2019, four confirmed cases of monkeypox arrived in the UK, all recent travellers from Nigeria. Three further cases with similar travel history arrived in 2021. “It could hypothetically be that the virus transmission amplified from this low level of transmission when by chance it entered the population that is at present amplifying transmission,” Heymann said. He stressed it was one of many hypotheses that needed further study before any conclusions could be drawn. Genetic studies on monkeypox viruses taken from people in the ongoing outbreak show a close resemblance to the virus that reached the UK, Israel and Singapore from Africa in 2018 and 2019. They also carry mutations that may have arisen as the virus then circulated at low levels. While the UK’s first official case of 2022 arrived from Nigeria on 4 May, the virus was already in the country. On 14 May the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) released images of monkeypox, and doctors in sexual health clinics realised some of their patients could have the disease. The patients had tested negative for common infections and doctors suspected a condition called disseminated gonococcal infection, before the patients tested positive for monkeypox. “This may be a virus that’s been circulating undetected for quite a while,” said Prof Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium. “They all have a common ancestor and that common ancestor probably dates back to 2019, though it’s too early to date with any kind of accuracy.” It is unclear whether mutations seen in the virus make the strain more transmissible in humans, but scientists point to the virus having evolved while infecting humans. “We know that chronic infection is not a plausible scenario, and that means there has been a chain of transmission events that apparently went unnoticed,” Van Ranst said. The Covid pandemic may have played a role, as people had less contact with GPs and other health services during the crisis. Asked if the outbreak might not have come to light if sexual health clinics had not been alerted by the first UK case, Van Ranst said: “It’s entirely possible.” Prof Oyewale Tomori, a virologist and adviser to the Nigerian government, said more studies were needed to understand what is happening. “Perhaps it was spreading silently within the community until we had this flare-up following some of the changes in behaviour we’ve seen,” he said. “Between 2019 and 2020 if anybody came up with a rash in any part of Europe, you’re not going to think of monkeypox, your thought would be other diseases that cause a rash. “And if the system misses that one case, then of course that’s an opportunity for it to spread from one person to another. I think the amplification came where you have a lot of people gathering with very close contact.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/monkeypox-may-have-been-circulating-in-uk-for-years-scientists-say"},
{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak was waiting to happen, say scientists", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Tue 24 May 2022 23.30 BST", "text": "The unprecedented surge in monkeypox cases in the UK and beyond was an outbreak waiting to happen after the end of global smallpox vaccination more than 40 years ago, scientists say. The UK  Health  Security Agency announced a further 14 cases in England on Tuesday, bringing the total to 70, and one further patient in Scotland. No cases have been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. Routine smallpox vaccination wound down in most countries before 1980 when the World Health Assembly declared the disease eradicated. Because the vaccine also protects against monkeypox, the campaign had kept that disease in check too, notably in regions of central and western Africa where the virus is endemic. In the decades since smallpox vaccination ended, the proportion of people protected against monkeypox has fallen substantially, allowing the virus to spread more easily from animals into humans and from person to person, fuelling the risk of a major outbreak. “This outbreak was really waiting to happen,” said Dr Romulus Breban, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Mathematical modelling by Breban and his team in 2020 found that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, immunity to monkeypox fell from 85% in the early 1980s to 60% in 2012. With declining immunity, monkeypox posed “an ever-increasing threat for health security”,  he wrote  at the time. In 2020 the DRC had more than 4,000 suspected cases and at least 171 deaths. “Our immunity level is almost zero,” Breban said. “People aged 50 and above are likely to be immune but the rest of us not, so we are very, very susceptible.” He believes the outbreak can be contained and said it was an opportunity to propose vaccination campaigns in countries where the virus is endemic. Until this year only a handful of cases of monkeypox had ever been spotted in the UK, all linked to travel from Nigeria. Since the first UK case of 2022 was announced on 7 May, nearly 300 suspected or confirmed cases have come to light in at least 16 countries. The surge in cases has raised questions about whether the monkeypox virus has evolved into a more transmissible form. So far scientists have found no evidence for this being the case, but researchers are studying the DNA to see if mutations in the virus may have changed its behaviour. Genetic studies so far suggest the virus matches strains that reached the UK, Singapore and Israel in 2018 and 2019. Prof David Heymann, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House’s global health programme, said the outbreak appeared more of a chance event, with the virus being amplified once it got into a community of men who have sex with men. Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there was unlikely to be the same “explosive growth” of infections into the general population that was witnessed with Covid. But he said the outbreak could continue for several months as contact tracing slows but does not stop transmission. “As with Covid, we can expect twists and turns as monkeypox outbreaks continue,” he said. “At the moment the transmission chains are mostly within sexually active younger men, but there are other settings where there is sufficient contact for monkeypox to spread. The longer the outbreak continues and the higher the prevalence, the more likely that monkeypox will find these other niches.” Researchers in the UK have revealed promising yet tentative signs that an antiviral may help to reduce illness from the virus. In a  study  published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, four of seven patients diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021 were given either brincidofovir or tecovirimat, drugs developed to treat smallpox. Findings from the three patients given brincidofovir suggest the drug provided little clinical benefit and did not appear to reduce the duration of the illness. However, the one patient treated with tecovirimat had a shorter hospital stay and appeared to shed virus, detected by PCR tests, for a shorter period of time. Dr Hugh Adler, a co-author of the study at Liverpool university hospitals NHS trust, said that although only one patient was involved, the result for tecovirimat was “a promising signal”. “Now that we’re seeing more cases, unexpectedly, we think it’s important to share,” he said. “This is the sum total of human experience with these drugs and monkeypox so far.” The UK has secured a supply of tecovirimat and is offering a smallpox vaccine to close contacts of people diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Sources suggest an  extra 20,000 doses of the vaccine  have been ordered to add to the UK’s stock of 5,000.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/monkeypox-outbreak-was-waiting-to-happen-say-scientists"},

Now experts have advised people who have been diagnosed with monkeypox  to avoid contact with their pets  for three weeks. “Based on current evidence, for pet rodents in households where there are infected people, temporary removal from the household for a limited quarantine period (21 days) and testing to exclude infection is recommended, particularly where there are infected human contacts who have had close direct and prolonged contact with the animal or its bedding and/or litter,” guidance from a multi-agency group states. Other mammals kept as pets, such as cats and dogs, should be kept under household isolation with regular vet checks “to ensure no clinical signs are observed”. Wendi Shepherd, the monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in  England . As a precautionary measure our health protection teams are advising confirmed cases to avoid contact with any household pets for 21 days.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) added that if possible someone else in the household should care for the pet, including feeding and grooming it. But the UKHSA said if it was not possible to avoid contact with pets, people with monkeypox should minimise contact and wash their hands before and after. However the UKHSA and Defra have stressed the risk of someone passing monkeypox to their pet is low, with the latter noting there is evidence of risk for only a limited number of species, most of which are rodents. “No cases of monkeypox have ever been suspected or reported in pets in the UK and the risk remains low,” said the chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss. The move comes as the UKHSA announced a further 16 monkeypox cases had been identified in England, bringing the total to 101. To date three cases have been found in Scotland and one each in Wales and  Northern Ireland .", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/27/monkeypox-patients-contact-pets-uk"},
{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak could be just ‘the peak of the iceberg’, WHO warns", "author": null, "date": "Sat 28 May 2022 04.31 BST", "text": "The World  Health  Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief, acknowledged on Friday in a briefing to countries. Since the UK first reported a confirmed monkeypox case on 7 May, nearly 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency in countries far from the states where the virus is endemic. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has put the number of such cases at 219. Endemic in a number of west and central African nations, monkeypox cases have suddenly been detected in more than 20 other countries around the world, including the US, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and nearly a dozen EU countries. The Spanish health ministry said on Friday that 98 cases had been confirmed there so far, while the UK currently counts 90 verified infections. Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday, adding that all the occurrences are in men, mainly aged below 40. Argentina confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in Latin America on Friday. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva. “We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said, but stressed there was no need to panic. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” Monkeypox is related to smallpox, a deadly disease that was eradicated in 1980. But monkeypox is much less severe, with a fatality ratio of 3-6%. Most people recover within three to four weeks. The initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and chickenpox-like rash. There is not much in the way of treatment, but some antivirals developed against smallpox exist, including one that was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency against smallpox, Briand pointed out. Vaccines developed for smallpox have also been found to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. However, since smallpox has not posed a threat in more than four decades,  most people under the age of 45 have not received the vaccine , and the supplies of the jabs are today very limited. Briand said experts were trying to determine what had spurred this “unusual situation”, saying preliminary investigations did not seem to indicate that the virus that causes monkeypox had changed or mutated. She voiced hope that the spread could be halted. “We have a good window of opportunity to stop the transmission now,” she said. “If we put in place the right measures now, we probably can contain this easily.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/monkeypox-outbreak-could-be-just-the-peak-of-the-iceberg-who-warns"},
{"title": "Further 71 cases of monkeypox detected in England", "author": "Harry Taylor", "date": "Mon 30 May 2022 19.03 BST", "text": "Another 71 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in England, according to the UK’s public health body. The UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) said the latest cases, as of 29 May, bring the total number in England to 172. Four cases have been detected in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales, taking the UK total to 179. Nearly 400 cases have been identified outside the virus’s usual areas of circulation, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  The updated case total comes after the UKHSA, along with authorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, issued joint guidance to stem the spread of the disease. It urged those with the virus to avoid close contact with others until their lesions have healed and any scabs have dried. They have also been told to avoid contact with pets  for three weeks . Anyone who has had contact with someone infected could be told to self-isolate for 21 days after a risk assessment. Updated guidance on Monday said that people who suspect they have the virus or have been diagnosed with it, and need to travel to get healthcare, should cover any lesions, wear a face mask and avoid public transport. They should also not have sex as soon as they notice the first symptoms, and use a condom for eight weeks after infection. Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to work closely with our colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure we are aligned in our approach to reducing the risk of transmission of monkeypox in the UK.” On Monday night, the WHO appeared to retreat on earlier comments where officials had said it could be the “peak of the iceberg”. Its top monkeypox expert, Dr Rosamund Lewis, said she did not think the virus would become globally prevalent: “At the moment, we are not concerned of a global pandemic.” The first cases in England were confirmed on 7 May. It is usually found in west and central Africa and can be transmitted through person-to-person close contact, including sex. A majority of cases identified so far are among men who have sex with men. Symptoms are normally mild and most recover within a few weeks. UKHSA has said that the risk to the UK population remains low, but people should be alert to any new rashes, spots, ulcers and blisters on their body. Anyone who has a rash with blisters should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre immediately, the agency added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/further-71-cases-of-monkeypox-detected-in-england"},
{"title": "Why are monkeypox cases suddenly emerging across the world and could the virus have mutated?", "author": "Melissa Davey", "date": "Mon 23 May 2022 18.30 BST", "text": "The  sudden emergence of monkeypox in several countries  has raised questions about how the virus, which is most common in central and west Africa, has managed to spread. Many health experts have said the monkeypox cases in 12 countries are not cause for panic, given the virus is much less infectious than illnesses like Covid and rarely fatal, but it is highly unusual. First identified in 1970, monkeypox cases usually only occur outside central and west  Africa  when a traveller becomes infected there and subsequently returns home. These cases do not usually lead to wider outbreaks. In other rare cases, owners of imported pets become infected, with animals such as rodents believed to be sources of transmission. But the World  Health  Organization [WHO] said cases are rising in non-endemic countries, with no link to travel or animals identified in most of these cases.  So what are the main theories about why cases are suddenly emerging this time? Prof. Raina MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute,  told the Medical Journal of Australia  that “waning of immunity from smallpox vaccination may be contributing to the increasing outbreaks of monkeypox”. “It is more than  40-50 years since mass vaccination ceased ,” she said. The smallpox vaccine offered the bonus of strong protection against monkeypox. A  study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases  in February which warned monkeypox cases were rising also attributed this to the cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination, given that virus has been declared by WHO as eradicated. In some countries where the virus has been detected, like Australia, mass smallpox vaccination never occurred. Epidemiologists flagged growing case numbers before WHO issued its alert earlier in May. There were calls for better worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases prior to the current outbreaks because of data suggesting a resurgence of the disease. Between 2010 and 2019, cases re-emerged in Liberia and Sierra Leone after a four-decade absence and in Central African Republic after three decades,  research published in February and led by Pallas Health Research and Consultancy in The Netherlands found . Since the Covid-19 pandemic began researchers and health workers worldwide are also more alert to symptoms of viruses and are quicker to report anything unusual, helping to lead to the detection of cases. Human-to-human spread is not easy for monkeypox;  one study found 3% of close contacts of someone with monkeypox will become infected . But the strange rise in cases has raised the possibility that the virus may have mutated in a way that makes person-to-person transmission more likely. More data and laboratory analysis is needed to confirm this, however, and for now it is just a theory. Sequencing of the virus in laboratories is occurring, and we should know within days whether the virus has changed. While monkeypox has been around for decades it is nonetheless considered a rare disease, meaning there is always more to learn about it. When monkeypox does spread between humans, it is through close physical contact with someone who has symptoms.  Monkeypox  can lead to pus-filled lesions developing on the skin, and contact with fluid from this rash – including contact from contaminated clothing and bedding – can spread the virus. Sores in the mouth can also be infectious. In the current outbreak, clusters have occurred among men who have sex with men, which has not been the case previously. But experts have warned against declaring it a sexually transmitted disease, or attributing spread to certain communities. It is much more likely that the close contact that occurs during sex is responsible for spread, rather than the disease being sexually transmitted. In the meantime WHO has urged people not to stigmatise those diagnosed with the virus. “ We have seen messages stigmatising certain groups of people  around this outbreak of monkeypox,” WHO said in a statement. “We want to make it very clear that this is not right. First of all, anyone who has close physical contact of any kind with someone who has monkeypox is at risk, regardless of who they are, what they do, who they choose to have sex with or any other factor.” It could be that the virus has not mutated at all, but that it has taken advantage of an ideal opportunity to spread when all the conditions were right; for example, in a community of people in close contact with each other, where there were multiple opportunities for spread.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/why-are-monkeypox-cases-suddenly-emerging-across-the-world-and-could-the-virus-have-mutated"},
{"title": "UK to announce more monkeypox cases as efforts ramp up to contain outbreak ", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Sun 22 May 2022 20.59 BST", "text": "Public health officials are to announce more UK  monkeypox  cases on Monday, as efforts ramp up to contain the first multinational outbreak of the virus that has led to cases in at least 14 countries. The unusual outbreak of the rare disease has sparked a wave of contact tracing and testing, with the closest contacts of confirmed cases – such as partners and people in the same household – offered a vaccine and told to isolate at home for up to 21 days. Under UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) guidance, the same high-risk contacts are advised to avoid immunosuppressed people, pregnant women and children under 12, as they are more vulnerable to serious infections. Reports have said that one of the UK cases is a child who is in intensive care in London with the disease. The NHS and UKHSA said they would not discuss individual cases. While some monkeypox patients have been admitted to hospital, many confirmed cases that do not need specialist care are told to isolate at home until local health protection teams are confident they are no longer infectious. “The vast majority of identified cases are isolating at home and do not require hospital admission,” said Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. Monkeypox does not spread easily, and most people who become infected develop only mild symptoms, including fever, rash and blisters, which can clear up without treatment. But the virus can cause more serious illness in those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UKHSA, said further cases identified over the weekend would be confirmed on Monday. Since the first was announced in the UK on 7 May – a person who arrived in London from  Nigeria  – the agency has confirmed 19 more cases, the majority among young men who have sex with men. The outbreak is unusual because although the UK has had sporadic cases of monkeypox before – seven from 2018 to 2021 – all previous cases were linked to travel from Nigeria. Most of the latest cases in the UK and beyond have no known links to parts of west or central  Africa  where the virus is endemic. Globally, more than 180 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries. More than half are in Spain and  Portugal . Genetic analysis of three monkeypox viruses from the outbreak have found it closely matches the virus that spread from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019. The same studies suggest that a Belgian man contracted the virus on a recent trip to Portugal. The pattern of the outbreak suggests the virus is spreading primarily through sexual networks. The infection can be passed on through close contact with body fluids, infected ulcers, and contaminated material such as towels and bedding. Superspreader events may have boosted the outbreak since it arrived in  Europe . “I think it’s possible that some of these outbreaks will be driven by superspreading events,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University. “For example, the Spanish health authorities are looking at a sauna as a site of single exposure that resulted in many secondary cases. The reportedly mild presentations of several cases may also be a factor, in that people will be more mobile and potentially likely to socialise. However, we do still need to understand more about the transmission dynamics.” Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning show that community transmission in the UK was “largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men”. Asked why cases were mostly in that group, she said: “That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have. “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department. We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country. “We would recommend to anyone who’s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash.” Dewsnap said sexual health clinics were already under massive pressures because of cuts and lack of support in recent years, while there were a “worrying number of unfilled genitourinary medicine specialist posts in sexual health clinics.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/monkeypox-uk-health-security-agency-to-announce-more-cases"},

UNAIDS said “a significant proportion” of recent monkeypox cases have been identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. But transmission was most likely via close physical contact with a monkeypox sufferer and could affect anyone, it added, saying some portrayals of Africans and LGBTI people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”. As of 21 May, the World  Health  Organization received reports of 92 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox cases and 28 suspected cases from 12 countries where the disease is not endemic, including several European nations, the US, Australia and Canada. “Stigma and blame undermine trust and capacity to respond effectively during outbreaks like this one,” said the UNAIDS deputy executive director, Matthew Kavanagh. “Experience shows that stigmatising rhetoric can quickly disable evidence-based response by stoking cycles of fear, driving people away from health services, impeding efforts to identify cases and encouraging ineffective, punitive measures.” Argentina’s health ministry said on Sunday it had detected a suspected case of monkeypox in Buenos Aires, amid growing global alarm over rising cases in  Europe  and elsewhere of the viral infection more common to west and central Africa. Israel and Switzerland both said they identified one infected person who had recently travelled abroad. Israel is investigating other suspected cases. Austria confirmed its first case of the virus on Sunday, while in the US health authorities said they might have found the country’s third case and were running tests on a patient in South Florida.

Public  Health  Wales, which has confirmed one case, urged people to be aware of the symptoms of the virus, adding it was important for gay and bisexual men to be alert. The majority of monkeypox cases recently diagnosed in England have been found among men who identify as gay, bisexual and among men who have sex with men.  The director of health protection at Public Health  Wales , Dr Giri Shankar, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed.” He added: “We are reassuring people that monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the general public is low. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.” On Thursday, a case of monkeypox was also confirmed in Northern Ireland. “This was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases elsewhere in the UK,”  the Public Health Agency (PHA) of Northern Ireland said in a statement . The UKHSA announced on Thursday that a further eight cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in England, bringing the total to 85. Three cases have also been identified to date in Scotland. The UKHSA has revealed that a vaccine against smallpox – a related but more serious disease that has been globally eradicated – is being offered to close contacts of people who have been diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. “Previous data from Africa suggests that  previous vaccines against smallpox may be up to 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection ,” a document released by the agency reveals. The rising number of cases of monkeypox in multiple countries around the world is unusual: while cases have cropped up in countries including the UK in the past, these have typically been in people who have returned from countries in central or western Africa, where the virus is endemic. Among the hypotheses experts have suggested to explain the surge is that the virus  may have been circulating  at low levels in the UK for several years before it took off. Experts have also noted the outbreak  may have been made more likely given most countries ended their smallpox vaccination programmes in the 1970s, and the vaccine also offers protection against monkeypox.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/wales-announces-discovery-of-its-first-monkeypox-case"},
{"title": "Tuesday briefing: Everything you need to know about monkeypox", "author": "Nimo Omer", "date": "Tue 24 May 2022 06.56 BST", "text": "Good morning. As the seemingly  never-ending fiasco of Partygate rumbles on  (new pictures, that were obtained by ITV News, appear to show the prime minister drinking with colleagues during the coronavirus lockdown in November 2020) another virus has begun worrying scientists. Understandably, after two years of a pandemic, any mention of a new viral outbreak is going to be quite alarming. So it’s no surprise that when countries across Europe and North America started  detecting cases of monkeypox , a disease usually found in central and western Africa, there was a bit of a panic. So far,  over 100 confirmed cases  have been identified in 16 countries. It feels eerily similar to reports of a mystery disease found in Wuhan in 2019 – but is it? I spoke to the Guardian’s science editor, Ian Sample, about how concerned we should really be. First though, the headlines: toasting a senior aide Foreign Office official witnessed her strike for 24 hours  life in prison A damning parliamentary report 57 cases of monkeypox  have been detected in the UK, with  Scotland announcing its first case yesterday , and that number will continue to grow. But before you start to worry about lockdowns and another deadly pandemic, below we have outlined some fairly reassuring facts about this newly-famous virus. Monkeypox has been around for a while. It’s a zoonotic virus (meaning it travels from animals to humans) and was first discovered in 1958 in colonies of monkeys. The first human case was recorded about 12 years later in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and for the last few decades the virus has generally stayed around central and west Africa, particularly in close proximity to tropical rainforests. Melissa Davey, Guardian Australia’s medical editor, has written  a great explainer  on the various reasons that cases of the virus are suddenly rising now. The virus has two genetic strains: the central African strain and the west African strain. The former is known to spread more easily and cause more severe symptoms whereas, generally speaking, the latter is milder – and it is that west African strain that is being found at the moment. “As far as I’m aware, no one outside Africa has died of monkeypox,” our science editor Ian Sample tells me. “Most people just shrug it off after a few weeks.” Ian’s right, according to the  World Health Organisation  there have been no fatalities associated with this outbreak.  Monkeypox has also been detected in the UK before, Ian says. “These cases caused doctors to scratch their heads in sexual health clinics. You had people turning up with ulcers and spots on their face and genitals, but they weren’t testing positive for the usual suspects like herpes.” But usually such patients have been quickly linked to somebody travelling to a country with high levels of monkeypox and bringing it back with them. Now – for the first time – the virus is being detected in people that have not travelled to western or central Africa. Scientists are left trying to figure out how these people were infected. Monkeypox is spread when there is close contact with an infected person or animal. “This virus isn’t airborne [like coronavirus],” Ian explains, “it gets into someone’s body through broken skin. Even if you can’t see those breakages the virus can get through.” This is perhaps why a lot of cases are found to have been sexually transmitted, but that’s not the only way it can happen. It is possible to catch it the way you would any other virus, like the flu, through your nose or mouth, if someone infected sneezed into your face, or coughed right at you, “but they’d have to be pretty close,” Ian adds. “And there’s also a possibility of getting it if you’re changing the bedding of a patient who’s had a lot of these ulcers which can have quite high concentrations of the virus in them.” But crucially there does have to be a high level of close contact. There’s no need to sound the alarm just yet. Monkeypox is not like Covid-19 – it’s nowhere near as transmissible, meaning that large outbreaks are very unlikely, and as it’s the milder strain of monkeypox, there’s not much to worry about in terms of death rates or severe disease either. “Monkeypox is a DNA virus, it doesn’t evolve anywhere near as fast as the RNA viruses, which is what coronavirus is,” Ian says. And because the virus is not new, doctors do have solutions on hand to mitigate damage: “the smallpox vaccine can give you about 85% protection against monkeypox. And there are also a couple of antivirals that could help.” That doesn’t mean monitoring isn’t needed. It’s still important we know who has got it and try to prevent the spread, as it can be dangerous for children, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems – hence why those testing positive are asked to isolate for three weeks. And the symptoms can be debilitating: headaches, nausea, fever, swelling lymph nodes, exhaustion and lesions that turn into ulcers on the face, hands and feet. But it’s not just those who have caught the disease that are suffering as a result of the outbreak. The UN has condemned what it has described as  racist and homophobic reporting of monkeypox . A significant proportion of these cases have been detected in men who have sex with men, but scientists are clear that this does not mean that only LGBT+ people can catch the disease. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infected is likely to get infected themselves. But the sinister undertone of some reporting is reminiscent of other viral infections that have been used to further stigmatise gay men in the past. “​​We saw this in the 1980s with HIV,” says Ian. “At times it was referred to as a ‘gay disease’ and that is obviously nonsense – anyone can get HIV just like anyone can get monkeypox.” Unlike Covid-19, monkeypox has been around for decades and been thoroughly studied. We know it doesn’t spread easily, it’s outside its natural home in the tropical rainforests, and it’s almost impossible to not know you have it once symptoms begin, making contact tracing and isolation easier. Cases will inevitably increase but unless something changes, it shouldn’t have the same catastrophic impact as the last disease to dominate the headlines.

{"title": "Monkeypox cases put UK's tropical disease response to the test", "author": "Nazia Parveen", "date": "Sun 7 Oct 2018 14.48 BST", "text": "The man had contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), the first such diagnosis in the UK since 2013. Beadsworth said his chances of survival were slim. Of the previous four cases, three had died. After weeks of painstaking, meticulous care in the world-renowned tropical diseases unit, however, the man survived. For Beadsworth, 50, and his team, there would be little respite. He was driving home when he received a phone call. A person in the UK  had contracted monkeypox for the first time . The airborne disease was diagnosed in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall. “We were literally stepping down the unit after looking after the Mers case. This guy had survived and we were really pleased for him,” he said. “But then I got a call to say we would have to reactivate the network because of a probable monkeypox case in Cornwall. My first thought was: ‘You’ve got to be joking.’ We had just had a pretty hellish couple of weeks and now we had this.” Following the  Ebola  crisis of 2014, when the West African epidemic was declared an international emergency, Beadsworth and other health professionals came up with a contingency plan if a deadly infectious disease were to enter the UK. Now this plan from the High Consequence Infectious Diseases Network – comprising five NHS trusts – was being tested in reality. Infectious disease experts took part in a teleconference call and plans to contain monkeypox were discussed. “The call lasted around 30 minutes. It was a business call and quick decisions were made,” Beadsworth said. “Although we regard ourselves as specialists in tropical medicine, no one here had seen a case in the UK. There was a lot of rapid literature reading that night.” The patient was sent to the Royal Free hospital in London, one of five centres in the UK able to care for patients with highly infectious diseases. Beadsworth was relieved. The emergency action plan had worked, the patient had been isolated and the risk had seemingly been contained. Four days later, however, the “most unimaginable” thing happened. A  second, unrelated case of monkeypox was diagnosed  in Blackpool. The patient had also just returned to the UK from Nigeria. “It was fairly unimaginable to have a Mers case, and then it was unimaginable to have one case of monkeypox in Cornwall. Then to have a second one, it really was like lightning striking twice,” he said. The patient was taken to the Blackpool Victoria hospital before being transferred to Liverpool.  Consultants, registrars and nurses undertook a process called “donning and doffing” to minimise the risk of spreading the disease and catching it themselves. It included wearing extra protective clothing, fitted masks, goggles, and three pairs of gloves. After each contact with the patient all their clothing was incinerated. Beadsworth said: “The patients tend to be very scared because they have suddenly been moved and they have got all these individuals wearing these space suits and they can’t see faces. But you can’t breach, you can’t make a mistake.” The rare viral infection, normally confined to African states, was first discovered in monkeys in 1958. It is similar to smallpox, but not as deadly. The first case in a human was identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, and cases have since been reported in other central and west African countries. On 26 September  a third case of monkeypox was diagnosed in the UK  in a female healthcare worker briefly involved in the treatment of the second patient at Blackpool Victoria hospital. The 40-year-old healthcare assistant from Fleetwood is now being looked after in the specialist unit at Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. It is understood that the woman’s colleagues at Blackpool Victoria and patients at her GP surgery have been offered the smallpox vaccine, which protects against the monkeypox virus. On Wednesday the Blackpool Gazette reported that residents in Fleetwood were alarmed by the sight of paramedics in white overalls and face masks at a house. A woman was taken to hospital but tests have since confirmed she had not contracted the disease. Public  Health  England, the government agency leading the effort to contain the UK outbreak, confirmed it was linked to the monitoring of monkeypox. For Beadsworth it has been challenging but also fascinating to deal with monkeypox in the UK. Samples taken from the UK patients and sent to the to the rare and imported pathogens laboratory near Salisbury will now help to develop vaccines. “It has been incredibly rewarding because this is what we have set this unit up for,” he said. “But the single most important thing that has come out of this is that the network that was set up after Ebola has worked. It may not appear like that to the public at the moment, but behind the scenes it has worked really, really well.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/07/monkeypox-cases-put-uks-tropical-disease-response-to-the-test"},
{"title": "Monkeypox cases in UK more than double to 57", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Mon 23 May 2022 17.50 BST", "text": "Public health officials have confirmed 36 new cases of monkeypox in England, bringing to 57 the total number of known infections in the UK. Efforts to contain the outbreak are continuing, with patients isolated either in hospital or at home and their closest contacts being told to isolate and avoid contact with vulnerable people such as young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems, for up to three weeks. The most at-risk contacts have been offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, which offers cross-protection against monkeypox, a far milder disease, and can be effective up to two weeks after exposure to the virus. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK  Health  Security Agency, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK. Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact-tracing efforts, you are helping us limit the spread of this infection.” Austria, Switzerland and Israel became the latest nations to declare cases. At least 15 countries outside Africa have now detected the disease, totalling about 100 cases. Earlier on Monday,  Scotland  confirmed its first patient, who is isolating in hospital. Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland, said the overall risk to the public was low but he urged anyone with an unusual blister-like rash or blister-like sores on their body to avoid close contact with others and seek medical advice if worried. “We have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with such cases of infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed,” he said. “We are working with NHS Boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.” Boris Johnson, when asked about the outbreak during a visit to a school in south-east London, said monkeypox was a rare disease, but it was important to “keep an eye on it” given the unprecedented outbreak. “So far the consequences don’t seem to be very serious, but it’s important that we keep an eye on it, and that’s exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing,” he said. Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or use of the smallpox vaccine, Johnson said: “As things stand, the judgment is that it’s rare. I think we’re looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. It hasn’t yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.” Monkeypox does not spread easily and is a mild disease in most people, but it can cause more serious illness in young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Phin said more vaccine doses and antivirals for monkeypox had been ordered. The UKHSA announced the first case in the latest outbreak  on 7 May , in a person who had returned to London from Nigeria, but some cases identified since seem to have been infected earlier and the majority have no travel history to Africa. The outbreak appears to be driven by the milder, west African type of monkeypox, which has a case fatality rate of about 1%, compared with 10% for the more severe central or Congo Basin type. People who are infected with monkeypox typically develop a high temperature or fever before small, flat spots appear on their skin. These become raised and filled with fluid before scabbing over. The spots can start around the mouth and spread around the body, including to the genitals. The virus can spread through large respiratory droplets, direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, or blisters and ulcers, and through contaminated sheets, towels and utensils. “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms,” Hopkins said. “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service. Monkeypox is a viral infection most commonly found in animals in rural central and west Africa. In recent years countries such as Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have witnessed more cases in humans, with the virus spreading between people. A small number of cases have been detected in the UK since 2018, but until this year all were associated with travel to Nigeria. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s lead on emerging diseases, said there would be more cases in the coming days, but the virus could be stopped. “This is a containable situation, particularly in the countries where we are seeing these outbreaks that are happening across Europe, in North America as well. We can stop human-to-human transmission,” she said. ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/scotland-reports-first-monkeypox-case"},

Three of the cases were detected in London, and one in the north-east of England, the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) announced on Monday. It is working to find links between the latest four cases, which all appear to have been contracted in the capital. Common contacts have been established between two of the four people who have caught the virus. Those needing care are being treated in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal free hospital and Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London, and the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. The cases do not, however, seem to be connected to the previous confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK  announced on 14 May , nor the  first UK case announced on 7 May , which has led to concerns that there has been community transmission of the virus. The first case was a person who had recently travelled to  Nigeria , which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection before travelling to the UK. UKHSA added that all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual. The health body is therefore asking these groups “to be alert” to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Due to the recent rise in case numbers and uncertainties about how the infections were transmitted, UKHSA has said it is working closely with NHS partners to establish whether there have been any more cases in recent weeks, and with international partners to examine whether other countries have seen a similar rise in monkeypox. The health agency emphasises that the virus does not spread easily between people and that the risk to the UK population is low. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” The rash, which can develop as part of the virus, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The health agency also said that initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/four-new-cases-of-monkeypox-identified-in-the-uk-bringing-total-to-seven"},

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus similar to smallpox. According to the   federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), it was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, chills, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that often begins on the face and spreads to the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The CDC said it was  working  with airline, state and local health authorities in 27 states to identify and assess individuals who may have been in contact with the person on flights from Lagos to Atlanta and Atlanta to Dallas on 9 July. The individual went to the emergency room at a Dallas hospital and was diagnosed with monkeypox on 15 July,  Stat News  reported. People being monitored include those who sat within 6ft of the infected individual on flight from Lagos, those who used the flight’s bathroom, flight attendants, airline workers who cleaned the bathroom and family members who came in contact with the individual in  Dallas . The CDC  said  the infection rate for the monkeypox strain concerned was one in 100 people. “It’s believed the risk of spread of monkeypox on the plane and in the airports is low, as travelers were required to wear masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic and monkeypox is primarily spread through respiratory droplets,” it said. The Dallas county judge, Clay Jenkins,  said : “While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public. Dallas county health and human services is working closely with local providers, as well as our state and federal partners.” The incubation period for monkeypox ranges from three to 17 days, similar to the two- to 14-day period for Sars-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the CDC has asked health authorities to monitor the individuals for 21 days, ending on 30 July. “We’re in the time frame where we certainly want to closely monitor people,”  said  Andrea McCollum, who leads the poxvirus epidemiology unit at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. “It is a lot of people,” she said. The last detection of monkeypox in the US was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states. The outbreak occurred after a shipment from Ghana to Texas contained rodents and small mammals that had the virus. Nigeria has seen a rise in monkeypox cases and seven exported cases have been  detected:  four in the UK and others in Israel, Singapore and the US.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/26/us-monkeypox-exposure-health-officials"},

There has been a fourth, and probably fifth, case of monkeypox detected in two  New South Wales  residents who recently returned from Europe. According to NSW  Health , the two men in their 30s, who were travelling companions, developed mild illnesses several days after arriving back in Sydney. Both men presented to a doctor with symptoms clinically compatible with monkeypox.  Urgent testing results for one of the men is consistent with monkeypox, making it the fourth case in NSW. His companion is likely to be confirmed as the fifth case.  Both men are isolating at home. As Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths remain high across Australia, Victoria is scaling back its dedicated pandemic response workforce, reports  .

The state government believes the time is right for the shake-up, with 70% of all Covid-19 vaccinations currently delivered by local GPs and pharmacists and more people opting to use rapid antigen tests. Under the changes, local public health units will lead the delivery of Covid-19 services under the health department’s stewardship. “The Covid-19 Response was always a time-limited operation,” a Victorian government spokesman said on Saturday. Victorian health minister  has acknowledged the state is facing a “challenging winter” as bubbling Covid-19 cases and the return of flu place further pressure on the system. While Australia’s Covid-19 intensive care figures have fallen in the past fortnight, about 2,700 patients remain in hospitals across the country. More than 28,000 new Covid-19 cases were reported in Australia on Saturday, along with a further 60 deaths to take the weekly toll to 292.

The reclusive country has been waging a battle against an unprecedented Covid-19 wave since declaring a state of emergency and imposing a nationwide lockdown last month, fuelling concerns over a lack of vaccines and medical and food supplies. The total number of fever patients compiled across the country since late April neared 4 million, and the death toll rose by one to 71, KCNA said, using data from the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters. KCNA has said the epidemic has shown signs subsiding, after daily tallies of fever cases topped 390,000 two weeks ago. North Korea has never confirmed how many people have tested positive for Covid-19, apparently lacking testing supplies.

{"title": "More monkeypox cases detected in UK ‘on daily basis’, says scientist", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Sun 22 May 2022 14.40 BST", "text": "More monkeypox cases are being detected in Britain “on a daily basis”, a senior doctor has warned, amid reports that a child has been admitted to intensive care with the disease. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser to the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), said an update on confirmed cases would be released on Monday as efforts continue to contain the outbreak using contact tracing, testing and vaccination. The number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 20 on Friday and is expected to climb significantly in the weeks ahead as more people are traced and others come forward for testing. Public health officials are still working to identify the source of the outbreak as many of the patients have no known links to other cases. Monkeypox is a mild disease in most people and resolves without treatment in two to four weeks. But it can be more dangerous in vulnerable people, such as those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children. According to the  Sunday Telegraph , the UK cases include a child who is being treated in intensive care in a London hospital. The UKHSA said it did not confirm or discuss information at patient level. The agency confirmed the first case of monkeypox on 7 May, three days after a passenger with symptoms returned to London from Nigeria, a country that has had a large number of cases since 2017. Sexual health clinics have since reported a flurry of cases among men who have sex with men, some of whom developed symptoms weeks earlier. More than 180 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries. More than half are in Spain and Portugal. “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department,” Dr Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning. Asked if the virus was spreading in the community in the UK, she said: “Absolutely. We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country.” Monkeypox was first discovered in monkeys used for research in 1958, but the natural reservoir for the disease is believed to be rodents. The virus is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. Until this year, only seven cases had been detected in the UK, in 2018, 2019 and 2021, and all were linked with travel to Nigeria. “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men,” Hopkins said. Asked why cases were mostly in that group, she said: “That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have.” “We would recommend to anyone who’s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash” she added. Monkeypox is not a highly infectious disease and most cases in rural Africa are believed to arise when people come into contact with infected animals. But the disease can spread from person to person through close contact with ulcers and blisters, which often appear around the mouth and genitals; respiratory droplets; and contaminated materials such as bedding, towels and cooking utensils. The incubation period can be as long as 21 days, meaning symptoms can take three weeks to appear after exposure to the virus, but in the latest outbreak, many patients are developing a rash within days. Patients can develop a fever before other symptoms come on. To help contain the spread of the virus, high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, including some healthcare workers, have been given shots of a smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, which can protect against monkeypox. “We’re using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms,” Hopkins said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/22/more-monkeypox-cases-detected-in-uk-on-daily-basis-says-scientist"},

Monkeypox is typically limited to Africa, and rare cases in the US and elsewhere are usually linked to travel there. A small number of confirmed or suspected cases have been reported this month in the  United Kingdom , Portugal and  Spain . Health officials in the US said they are in contact with officials in the UK and Canada as part of the investigation. But “at this point in time, we don’t have any information that links the Massachusetts case to cases in the UK,” said Jennifer McQuiston of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though it is the only US case the CDC is aware of, “I do think we are preparing for the possibility of more cases,” she said. The US case poses no risk to the public, and the Massachusetts resident is hospitalized but in good condition, officials said. The man traveled to Canada at the end of April to meet friends and returned in early May, McQuiston said. A CDC statement said he used private transportation. The case is the first in the US this year. Last year, Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who traveled to Nigeria. Monkeypox typically begins with a flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes, followed by a rash on the face and body. In Africa, people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, and it does not usually spread easily among people. However, investigators in Europe say most of the cases have been in gay or bisexual men, and officials are looking into the possibility that some infections were spread through close contact during sex. Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox.  It is usually mild, although there are two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe – with up to 10% mortality – and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate of more like 1% of cases.

{"title": "We will see more cases of monkeypox, warn British scientists", "author": "Robin McKie", "date": "Sat 21 May 2022 23.04 BST", "text": "Scientists have warned that they expect monkeypox cases  to continue to rise  this week as more infected people are traced by health authorities. More than 90 cases have already been reported in Europe, the US and Australia, including 20 in Britain.  The World Health Organization said there were a further 28 suspected cases, in addition to the 92 confirmed in 12 member states which were not endemic for the virus. The global figure is unprecedented for a disease that is normally confined to central and west Africa. Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, so doctors have been puzzled by the outbreak and by the appearance of cases on different continents at the same time. The virus is only transmitted from person to person through close physical contact –  including sexual intercourse . Symptoms are usually mild – headaches, aching muscles and exhaustion – but monkeypox also causes skin lesions which can become infected, resulting in secondary infections. “I am certain that we are going to see more cases,” said Charlotte Hammer, a Cambridge University expert on emerging diseases. “First, health authorities are now – very actively – looking for cases, so we are more likely to spot people with mild versions which we might previously have missed or misdiagnosed. “In addition, monkeypox has an incubation period of between one and three weeks so it is likely we will see new infections among those who were in early contact with the outbreak’s first cases.” Monkeypox has been found outside Africa in the past, but the number and range of cases in the present outbreak is unusual. “Essentially, we face two options,” Hammer said. “Either the virus is inherently different now or perhaps our susceptibility to it has changed. Alternatively, it could just be that we have an encountered a perfect storm of conditions that have allowed the virus to spread this way. I think the latter scenario is the more likely one.” One possibility is that the effects of past mass  smallpox vaccinations  is fading, leaving fewer people with protection against the closely related monkeypox. However, Prof Keith Neal, of Nottingham University, added: “Has the virus changed? Well it does not actually appear to be any more lethal, though something may have affected its transmissibility. And don’t forget this is a DNA virus and is unlikely to mutate at the rates that RNA viruses do, including those that cause Covid or HIV. Overall, I am not too worried.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/we-will-see-more-cases-of-monkeypox-warn-british-scientists"},

Public  Health  England (PHE) says monkeypox is not very transmissible and the patient is not thought to pose a risk to other people.

PHE is getting in touch with people who may have been in contact with the patient as a precautionary measure, including those who travelled to the UK on the same flight. It says they will be given appropriate advice and be monitored if necessary. “Monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low. We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary,” said Dr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at PHE. “PHE and the  NHS  have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission,” she said. The individual was in south-west England when they fell ill and was transferred to the high consequence infectious disease centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London.

There was no link to the second case, it was said at the time, even though that person had also spent time in Nigeria. The third was a healthcare worker involved in the care of one of the patients at Blackpool Victoria hospital before the infection was identified. Last year PHE said there had been a sustained outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and that it was expected the virus would continue to circulate there. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease which does not easily spread between humans and is usually self-limiting, meaning people recover within a few weeks. Sometimes, however, they become severely ill and it can be fatal in up to 10% of cases. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

The Africa CDC set up seven working groups allowing doctors and scientists working in richer countries to give regular advice remotely. “They have been extremely useful during this pandemic,” Nkengasong said. “We need to formalise it and facilitate the return to the continent to support the public need.” Africa seems to have  suffered less severely from Covid  and its variants than other continents. About 10 million people are estimated to have been infected but that is probably an undercounting, Dr Nkengasong said, and about 220,000 people have died. “That’s relatively low for a continent of 1.3 billion,” he said. “We saw  India was overwhelmed by Covid  in May, you couldn’t hide it. We’ve not seen a scenario in Africa where people are dying on the streets. “I think there is a puzzle of why many more people have been infected in Africa, but it has not translated into many deaths. That is a research question we need to investigate, and also how many deaths we are missing. “We have to be prepared for variants to emerge that will be more challenging than what we are dealing with.” Africa CDC has been instrumental in creating the Sentinel network of labs to track the virus using genomic sequencing that led to the detection of the Omicron variant in Botswana in November. “We have the infrastructure in place to detect early, prevent and respond,” he said. “Take west Africa – there’s a lot of public health assets there. The Noguchi [Medical Research] Institute in Nigeria is a state-of-the-art facility. The Pasteur Institute in Cote d’Ivoire, the Pasteur Institute in Senegal, the Medical Research Council in the Gambia – but they were not talking to each other. The whole concept of this new public health order is to use as much in the region as you can.” He added that in 2018 he was contacted by public health officials in Sierra Leone about a suspected monkeypox case, asking for help to find someone at the US CDC to test for the disease. “I said no, if you send that to Cote d’Ivoire, I know they have the primers to help you do that.” That mindset of Africans always needing help from richer western nations is far too widespread, he said. “People see the continent as a place to go, do a few projects, gather the data, publish it, do a few clinical trials and get out. That is not global health. It should be an equal partnership, recognising that the principal investigators should come from the developing countries.” The pandemic provided an example of the limits of western help, he said, with the WHO’s  Covax  programme. The Gavi alliance, which directs the programme, had pledged 2bn doses of vaccines to 144 poorer countries in 2021, but managed about 900m. Earlier this month, poorer nations rejected 100m doses that were close to expiring. There have been heated debates about whether western countries were hoarding vaccines. “Covax represents the best mechanisms of global cooperation,” Nkengasong said. “But look at what happened. It’s a good example of where good intention is not matched by reality. The promissory note that African countries would get vaccines at the same time didn’t happen. “And what we did, under the leadership of President Ramaphosa, we established the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team and we were able to acquire 400m doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.” So far Africa CDC has launched 12 pandemic initiatives, he said. As well as genomic surveillance and vaccines, there are plans to secure diagnostics and testing kits, and medical supplies.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/africas-health-boss-seeks-to-tempt-expat-medics-to-come-back-home"},
{"title": "Medic becomes third person infected with monkeypox in England", "author": "Damien Gayle", "date": "Wed 26 Sep 2018 13.42 BST", "text": "A medical worker has become the third person diagnosed with monkeypox in England, less than a month after the infection first appeared in the country. The person had cared for a patient at Blackpool Victoria hospital who was subsequently diagnosed with monkeypox, according to Public  Health  England (PHE). It is thought to be the first case of the virus spreading within the UK. All three infected patients are being treated in isolation units in different regions. It is thought the virus passed to the latest patient from an individual who contracted it after travelling to Nigeria, where an outbreak began 12 months ago. That patient – the  second recorded case  in the UK – was diagnosed days after a resident of Nigeria staying at a naval base in Cornwall  presented with symptoms . PHE said there was no UK link between the first two patients. The first patient is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London, the second is at the Royal Liverpool University hospital, and the latest is at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Monkeypox is caused by a virus that enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion before a rash develops, usually beginning on the face and spreading to other parts of the body. The rash goes through different stages before finally forming a scab that later falls off. Most people recover within several weeks and suffer no long-term effects, according to PHE. The first case of monkeypox outside of Africa  was recorded in 2003 . The virus, which comes from the same family as smallpox and cowpox, was first identified in a captive monkey about four decades ago and has subsequently been found in a range of animals in central and west Africa, particularly rodents. People living in rural areas of west Africa are regularly exposed to the virus and infections are common. A large and sustained outbreak of monkeypox began in Nigeria in September 2017, and since then sporadic cases have been reported. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for monkeypox, according to  the World Health Organization . Most people vaccinated for smallpox will be protected, but smallpox vaccines are not generally available since its global eradication. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the national infection service at PHE, said the latest case was “not wholly unexpected” and that the agency was tracing all potential contacts. “This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made,” he said. “We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly.” PHE previously said it was also trying to contact passengers who were near the first patient on the flight to the UK. It said people who had no symptoms were not considered to be infectious and anyone who was not contacted did not need to take any action.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/26/medic-becomes-third-person-infected-with-monkeypox-in-england"},
{"title": "Australia’s first cases of monkeypox virus identified in NSW and Victoria ", "author": null, "date": "Fri 20 May 2022 05.31 BST", "text": "Two cases of monkeypox virus have been confirmed in Australia with one in  New South Wales  and another in Victoria. The NSW case was a man in his 40s who developed a mild illness several days after returning from Europe. He and a household contact are isolating at home, NSW  Health  said on Friday. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said a preliminary test was positive and subsequent testing confirmed the case. The Victorian case was in a returned traveller from the UK. The man, in his 30s, developed mild symptoms before returning to Melbourne on 16 May and immediately sought medical attention. “Testing has confirmed that he has the virus and he remains in isolation at the Alfred with mild symptoms,” the Victoria health department said on Friday. Australia has joined a growing list of nations affected by the rare tropical illness including Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and the UK. Monkeypox occurs mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in humans in 1970. The illness can be transmitted from person to person through air droplets, close bodily contact or sharing contaminated linens or objects. Four countries in Africa – Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria – have reported cases of monkeypox in 2022. Chant said monkeypox was a rare virus that did not spread easily between people. It usually required “prolonged face-to-face contact” to spread, she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The chief health officer said people should be particularly vigilant if they had returned overseas “from large parties or sex-on-premises venues”. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said it was “doubtful” there would be a large number of cases in Australia “based on the long history of monkeypox already existing since 1970 in humans”. “My theory on this is that it’s party season in Europe and North America. They’ve come out of Covid and there’s a lot of partying going on … with close associations,” he said. Chant said the infection was “usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks”. She said people most at-risk were those with “severe underlying immunosuppression or disease … where those people may have a more torrid course and a worse outcome”. The general public and health clinics should be aware and have unusual skin rashes examined by specialist staff, the World Health Organization has said. The WHO also called for vigorous contact tracing around the spate of cases. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said state health authorities were closely monitoring the situation. “The advice I have is that it is a far less contagious condition than obviously Covid and things of that nature,” Morrison said in Perth. “We should be taking this seriously [but] at the same time I would say that no one should be alarmed at this point. We’ve got the best health authorities in the world.” Victoria’s health department said clinicians should consider testing for monkeypox in returned travellers with compatible symptoms. The state’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said suspected monkeypox clusters in Europe and North America appeared to be linked to West Africa. “That is a milder version of this monkeypox virus but it still has serious case fatality rates – so between 1% and 5%,” he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/australias-first-probable-case-of-monkeypox-virus-identified-in-nsw"},
{"title": "WHO official warns monkeypox could accelerate as cases spread across Europe", "author": null, "date": "Fri 20 May 2022 23.06 BST", "text": "A top European health official has warned that cases of the rare  monkeypox  virus could accelerate in the coming months, as the virus spread across Europe. Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for  Europe , said that “as we enter the summer season … with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate”. The virus, which causes distinctive pustules but is rarely fatal, has previously been seen in central and west Africa. But over recent weeks cases have been detected in European countries including Portugal and Sweden as well as the United States, Canada and Australia, Kluge said, calling the spread “atypical”. “All but one of the recent cases have no relevant travel history to areas where monkeypox is endemic,” he added. The health official warned that transmission could be boosted by the fact that “the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity”, and many do not recognise the symptoms. Most initial cases of the disease have been among men who have sex with men and sought treatment at sexual health clinics, Kluge said, adding “this suggests that transmission may have been ongoing for some time”. The WHO has said it is investigating the fact that many cases reported were people identifying as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. The official’s statement came as France, Belgium and Germany reported their first cases of monkeypox and Italy confirmed it now had three linked cases of the disease. Belgium’s three confirmed cases of monkeypox were on Friday linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, organisers of the Darklands Festival said. French authorities said the virus had infected a 29-year-old man living in the area that includes Paris. In Spain, the health ministry has reported seven confirmed cases, and has said it is awaiting confirmation on 23 more. But a regional health official said the authorities had recorded 21 confirmed cases in the Madrid region, most linked to a gay-friendly sauna in the heart of the capital. It was likely these figures had not yet been included in the nationwide tally. Portugal has recorded 23 confirmed cases. UK health officials on Friday reported 11 more confirmed cases in England, taking its total to 20. The UK  Health  Security Agency’s chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, said she expected “this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community”. She particularly urged gay and bisexual men to look out for symptoms, saying a “notable proportion” of cases in the UK and Europe came from this group. Monkeypox had not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, the UKHSA said. It can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions and droplets of a contaminated person, as well as shared items such as bedding and towels. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, sought to reassure the public, tweeting: “Most cases are mild and I can confirm we have procured further doses of vaccines that are effective against monkeypox.” Symptoms of the disease include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face. The first UK case was announced on 7 May, in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria. Two more cases were reported a week later, in people in the same household. They had no link to the first case. The UKHSA said that four further cases announced on 16 May all identified as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men and appeared to have been infected in London. It said two new cases reported on 18 May also had no history of travel to countries where the virus is endemic and “it is possible they acquired the infection through community transmission”. It did not give any details of the latest cases reported on Friday. On Thursday, health authorities in Italy announced the country’s first case of monkeypox, in a young man recently returned from the Canary Islands. On Friday they said two further cases, linked to “patient zero”, had been confirmed.

{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak: WHO working on sexual contact theory, top adviser says", "author": "Edward Helmore", "date": "Sat 21 May 2022 20.17 BST", "text": "A senior adviser for the  World Health Organization  has said the monkeypox outbreak seems to be spreading through sexual contact, and warned that case numbers could spike over the summer months as people attend major summer gatherings and festivals. David Heymann, chair of the WHO’s Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Infectious Hazards with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential, led a meeting of the group on Friday “because of the urgency of the situation”. Heymann told Reuters the WHO is working on the theory that cases so far identified were driven by sexual contact. “What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread, as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” Heymann said. Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said experts were likely to give more guidance to countries in the coming days.  Health  officials in several countries have warned that cases could rise further over the summer. Heymann said the monkeypox outbreak did not resemble the early days of Covid because it does not transmit as easily. “There are vaccines available, but the most important message is: you can protect yourself,” he said. The warning comes as a  New York  City resident has tested positive for the virus that causes monkeypox, health officials said, with the federal Centers for Disease Control investigating to determine whether the rare disease is actually present. Officials are treating the case as positive, and they have placed the patient – whose identity was not released – in isolation as they awaited final confirmation of the test result from the CDC. The notification came a day after authorities in New York City said they were investigating two potential cases. One of those potential cases in the city was ruled out, the state health department said. City epidemiologists have begun contacting people who may have been exposed to the person infected with Orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox. State and city officials have said they will try to determine how the New York patient was infected. The virus comes from wild animals, including rodents and primates, but can occasionally transfer to humans – with most of those cases traced to central and west Africa. The first known human infection dates back to 1970, when a nine-year-old boy in a remote part of DR Congo was diagnosed with the virus, which can cause fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with severe cases can also develop rash and pus-filled lesions on the face, palms of the hands and other body parts. The virus does not spread easily between people, though officials have said transmission can occur through contact with body fluids, monkeypox sores, items that have been contaminated with fluids or sores such as clothing and bedding, or through respiratory droplets following prolonged face-to-face contact. The apparent infection in New York comes as the WHO has identified about 80 cases globally, along with roughly 50 more suspected cases. The WHO warned more cases are likely to emerge. Infections have been confirmed in nine European countries, as well as the US, Canada and Australia. Health officials in Massachusetts confirmed its first case of the disease on Wednesday. Officials in the state have said the patient recently traveled to Canada. “The current patient is of no public health risk right now,” Dr Paul Biddinger, director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts general hospital said on Thursday. “People should just be aware of symptoms, but not be afraid in any way.” Cases of monkeypox  periodically show  in the US. Last year, Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who had recently traveled to Nigeria. In 2003, there was a six-state outbreak that infected 47 people. “Monkeypox is not a monkey virus,” D. Matt Aliota, head of the  University of Minnesota’s Program of Zoonotic Viral Infections , told  Minnesota’s Kare11  last week. “It was originally isolated out of a monkey, but monkeys aren’t the natural host. “It’s a virus that naturally infects small rodents and can then jump to humans through scratches or hunting and processing of meat.” In recent days, clinicians have been advised to treat patients with related symptoms as a “possible diagnosis” and to consult their state health department or the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center “as soon as monkeypox is suspected”. The advisory also gives  infection control information  to healthcare providers. Health officials have also made it a point to note that the monkeypox is harder to transmit – and therefore easier to contain – than the coronavirus. People who are exposed to monkeypox, which has a slow incubation period, can be given smallpox vaccines already in circulation to curb the severity of the sickness, according to the CDC.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/21/new-york-city-resident-monkeypox-virus-positive"},
{"title": "‘Now we have to deal with it’: what’s going on in the UK with monkeypox?", "author": "Ian Sample", "date": "Fri 20 May 2022 15.09 BST", "text": "Because monkeypox is listed as a “high-consequence infectious disease”, the situation moved fast. The sample was sent to Porton Down science park in Wiltshire where the UK  Health  Security Agency’s rare and imported pathogens laboratory swiftly ran a PCR test. This confirmed the infection, which the agency announced the next day, on 7 May. Sporadic cases of monkeypox are rare, but not new in Britain. In total, seven cases have been recorded, in 2018, 2019 and 2021, all linked to travel to Nigeria where monkeypox is endemic. But as public health officials were soon to discover, this year was to be different. For the first time, doctors have uncovered chains of transmission in the community – not only in Britain – among people with no known links to travel. The UK has confirmed 20 cases, but more than 100 known or suspected cases are under investigation in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Australia. “It’s come into the UK, it’s come into other countries, and now we have to deal with it and figure out what’s going on,” said Prof David Heymann, distinguished fellow at the Chatham House global health programme and former executive director of the communicable diseases cluster for the World Health Organization. Monkeypox is a viral infection that most people shrug off. There are two forms. The more serious is the central African or Congo strain. The latest cases involve the milder west Africa strain. Data from Africa suggest about 1% of people with cases die. The concern is less around the impact on healthy people, but on the vulnerable – those with weakened immune systems, for example – and on the virus spreading in healthcare settings. Despite its name – the virus was first detected in macaques – most human cases of monkeypox are believed to come from contact with other infected animals, such as rodents. Historically, transmission between humans has been limited – infections sometimes spread in homes but soon fizzle out. The virus spreads through large respiratory droplets, calling for prolonged or frequent face-to-face contact, or contact with body fluids such as saliva, or skin lesions, either directly or through contaminated sheets, towels and other items. A week after confirming the first patient, the UKHSA reported two more in a family in London, with no links to the first case. The announcement on Saturday 14 May was “crucial” according to one doctor, because it  carried images of monkeypox lesions . These were seen by specialists struggling to diagnose patients with unexplained rashes at sexual health clinics. They immediately sent swabs to Porton Down, which confirmed the cases as monkeypox. On the Monday, the health agency confirmed four more cases, all men who have sex with men and appeared to have caught the virus in London. The increase in mostly unrelated cases prompted the UK’s chief medical officers to send immediate advice to healthcare workers via the NHS central alerting system. It called on providers to ensure they had sufficient PPE to assess and treat patients and noted that the smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, offered some protection against monkeypox if given soon after exposure. The vaccine is already being offered to healthcare workers and contacts of cases at high risk of infection, and the Department of Health has secured thousands of doses in case the outbreak grows. The alert put the spotlight on men who have sex with men (MSM), and a flurry of cases have since been confirmed, pointing to spread in sexual networks. While public health experts rush to contain the outbreak, they warn against focusing on any particular group. “This could easily have popped up in a different context,” said one senior specialist in sexual health. “The MSM phenomena may well have been a very quick way to have drawn our attention to there being skin-to-skin transmission in the community.” Asked why most cases are in men who have sex with men, Sir Ali Zumla, professor of infectious diseases and international health at University College London, urged people to avoid any “prejudicial, unfair and stigmatising” focus on the group. He said clusters of monkeypox could occur in any group in close contact with infected people. It was “highly unlikely” the clusters were due to any change in the virus, he added. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said “everyone” should be alert to monkeypox symptoms. “If you notice any unusual rashes or lesions consistent with monkeypox, please contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service, calling ahead before your visit. A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, which is why we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms. We are working to trace contacts of cases and offering vaccination where appropriate, and meanwhile we are rapidly investigating how the virus is transmitting to understand why we are seeing this unusual outbreak.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/now-we-have-to-deal-with-it-whats-going-on-in-the-uk-with-monkeypox"},

Public  Health  England (PHE) said it was unusual to see two cases in such a short space of time and officials were searching for anyone, including medical staff, who had come into contact with either patient, to offer them health advice. They stressed, however, that there was no UK link between the two patients and said the virus does not spread easily between people. The second patient was being treated in the tropical and infectious diseases unit of Royal  Liverpool  University hospital. The unit’s clinical director, Dr Mike Beadsworth, said staff there were highly trained and experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases. “All necessary precautions are being taken by specialist staff and there is currently no risk to other staff, patients or visitors,” he said. “We ask that people continue to use our services as normal and that people only come to our emergency department if their condition is serious and/or an emergency.” PHE said monkeypox was “usually a mild, self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.”  It said the virus could be spread by close contact with an infected person, but the risk of transmission to the general population was “very low”. The first patient to be diagnosed, who was from  Nigeria  and was staying at a naval base in Cornwall, is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London. The second patient had just returned to the UK from the west African nation, where each is believed to have contracted the virus, and first went to Blackpool Victoria hospital. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of PHE’s national infection service, said monkeypox was probably still circulating in Nigeria after an outbreak there a year ago. Besides medical staff, PHE said it was trying to contact passengers who were near the first patient on the flight to the UK. It said people who had no symptoms were not considered to be infectious and anyone who was not contacted did not need to take any action. “Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion,” PHE said. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.

During an official visit to South Korea, Biden told reporters, “They haven’t told me the level of exposure yet but it is something that everybody should be concerned about.” The president, who was speaking at Osan airbase, also added: “It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential.” Initially, Biden said the government was exploring what vaccine “if any might be available” to protect people against the virus. But later his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the US had a “vaccine available to be deployed” against the monkeypox virus if necessary. Officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have previously said that people who are exposed to monkeypox, which has a slow incubation period, can be given existing smallpox vaccines to limit the sickness’s severity. Biden’s first remarks on the growing outbreak of the rare virus came a day after a senior adviser for the World Health Organization said the monkeypox seemed to be spreading through sexual contact and admonished that case numbers could continue climbing over the summer as people attended festivals and other major gatherings. “What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread, as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” said the WHO adviser, David Heymann.

The health ministry cautioned that the suspected cases – all in the Madrid region – had yet to be confirmed, but said a nationwide alert had been issued “to guarantee a swift, coordinated and timely response”. Madrid’s regional health department said the suspected cases were being analysed by the National Microbiology Centre to obtain a definitive diagnosis. “Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the 23 suspected cases point towards transmission through mucus during sexual relations,” it said in a statement. “The people involved are doing well and are isolating at home, but a close eye is being kept on them in case they need hospital treatment.” Fernando Simón, an epidemiologist who heads Spain’s health emergencies centre, said while it was unlikely that monkeypox would spread significantly, “that can’t be ruled out”.  Portuguese authorities have confirmed five cases and are investigating another 15 suspected cases. In a statement on Wednesday, Portugal’s health ministry said the cases it had detected – all in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region – had all involved men whose symptoms included ulcerative lesions. “The UK has reported similar cases of ulcerative lesions, with confirmed monkeypox virus infection,” it said. “We are monitoring the situation at national level and in conjunction with European institutions.” The first of the seven cases logged in the UK involved a person who had recently been to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the infection. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency, all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The health body is asking these groups “to be alert” to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. A rash that can look like chickenpox or syphilis can also develop and spread from the face to other parts of the body, including the genitals. Most people recover within a few weeks. A handful of cases of monkeypox, which has two forms and is typically found in central and western Africa, have been diagnosed in the UK in the past.

Monkeypox is related to smallpox, and has similar symptoms but is much less deadly. It is usually seen in central and western Africa.  Once it was confirmed, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration banned the import of all African rodents into the US.

They are being treated in an isolation unit at Guy’s and St Thomas’ infectious disease unit. Although monkeypox can be spread during close contact with an infected person, the agency said it did not spread easily and most people recovered in a few weeks. As a precaution, the UKHSA said its experts were working closely with the NHS and would be contacting those who may have had close contact with the person, including some passengers who were on the same flight. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other areas of the body. The rash progresses through different states until it forms a scab which falls off. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said “It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.” He added: “UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.” Dr Nicholas Price, director of NHSE high consequence infection diseases (airborne) network and consultant in infectious diseases at Guy’s and St Thomas’, said: “The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas’ hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.” The NHS said infection could be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa and was believed to be spread by rodents. Only a few people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, all of whom had either travelled to west Africa or been in close contact with somebody who had. According to information produced by Public Health England (the agency replaced by UKHSA last year), monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a “pox-like disease” were found in monkeys in captivity for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since then, it said, most cases have been reported from DRC and Nigeria, but there have been a handful of cases further afield. In 2003, cases were recorded in humans and pet prairie dogs in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. In December 2019, a patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, which PHE said was the fourth case diagnosed in the UK since the first imported cases the year before. There have also been cases in Israel and Singapore.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/patient-treated-for-monkeypox-in-isolation-at-london-hospital"},
{"title": "Monkeypox could significantly disrupt UK sexual health services, expert says", "author": "Jane Clinton", "date": "Sat 21 May 2022 11.57 BST", "text": "Monkeypox could have a “massive impact” on access to UK sexual health services, a leading doctor has warned. Dr Claire Dewsnap, the president of the British Association for Sexual  Health  and HIV, has voiced concern about how the viral infection could affect services as staff who come into contact with sufferers are forced to isolate. She told the BBC that clinic staff were already under significant pressure before monkeypox was identified. “It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who’s infected,” she said. As of Friday, there were 20 confirmed cases of the disease in the UK, and nine other countries outside central and west Africa have also reported outbreaks. Monkeypox, which was first detected in 1958, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. Dewsnap told BBC Radio 4: “In terms of the infection and its consequences for individuals, I’m not that concerned, but I am concerned about our ability to maintain good sexual health services and access for everyone while still managing this new infection.” She called for “adequate funding” for sexual health services that she said had experienced cuts to their budgets over the past decade, adding that the ability to see people quickly was important when dealing with infection. “Over the last 10 years, there’s been a significant decrease in funding through the public health budget, and that has seen a direct effect on staffing level and that means we have less capacity to see people,” she told BBC Breakfast. “We used to be able to see people within 48 hours of them contacting us – that’s really important because it cuts down the window where people have an infection [while] they don’t know they have an infection and therefore they can pass it on to people. “So, the speed in which we see people is really critical, and monkeypox coming along shows us that more than ever before.” She said proper funding would mean they could “ensure people can get in quickly, and therefore we can reduce the risk of infection of other people”. Meanwhile, Prof Sir Peter Horby, the director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, described the monkeypox outbreak as “an unusual situation” because the virus is being transmitted within communities outside central and west Africa. “It’s transmitted by close person-to-person contact and in the past we have not seen it being very infectious,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What’s unusual about what we’re seeing now is that we’re seeing transmission occurring in the community in Europe and now in other countries, so it’s an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now have ongoing transmission within certain communities.” He added: “It would appear that there is some element of sexual transmission, perhaps with just the very close contact between people and the skin lesions, because a large proportion of the current cases are being detected in gay and bisexual men. “So it’s very important that we get the message across that if people have unusual skin lesions that they do seek attention quickly so that we can control this. “The important thing is that we interrupt transmission and this doesn’t become established in the human population in Europe.” The UK Health Security Agency has said the infection can be transmitted through “close contact or contact with clothing or linens used by a person who has monkeypox”. However, it added that the virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population “remains low”. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitalia. The rash then changes and goes through different stages – and can resemble chickenpox – before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. According to the  NHS , symptoms are usually mild and clear up in “two to four weeks”, although severe cases can sometimes occur. The UK government has said it is stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against monkeypox.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/monkeypox-disruption-sexual-health-services"},
{"title": "Two people diagnosed with monkeypox in London, health officials say", "author": "Harry Taylor", "date": "Sat 14 May 2022 12.37 BST", "text": "Two more people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in  London , health officials said. The pair live in the same household and are not linked to the  previous confirmed case in England  that was announced on 7 May, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Of the latest two cases, one person is receiving care at the infectious disease unit at St Mary’s hospital, Imperial College healthcare NHS trust in London. The other is isolating and does not currently require hospital treatment, the UKHSA said. Health officials said they were investigating where transmission took place and how the people had become infected.  Contact tracing is taking place, the agency said, with those who have been in close contact with the diagnosed cases being given information and health advice. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, and people tend to recover within two to four weeks. The virus is mainly found in tropical forests in central and western Africa. Dr Colin Brown, the UKHSA’s director of clinical and emerging infections, said: “We have confirmed two new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on 7 May. “While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low. “We are contacting any potential friends, family or contacts in the community. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.” Prof Julian Redhead, the medical director of Imperial College healthcare NHS trust said: “We are caring for a patient in our specialist high-consequence infectious diseases unit at St Mary’s hospital. “All of the necessary infectious control procedures have been followed and we are working closely with UKHSA and NHS England.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/14/two-people-diagnosed-with-monkeypox-in-london-health-officials"},
{"title": "First ever case of monkeypox recorded in the UK", "author": null, "date": "Sat 8 Sep 2018 18.41 BST", "text": "The first ever case of monkeypox has been recorded in the UK. The rare viral infection was recorded on Friday in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall,  Public Health England  said. The patient was transferred to the infectious disease unit at the Royal Free hospital in London on Saturday morning. They are believed to have contracted the infection in  Nigeria  before travelling to the UK. PHE said monkeypox does not spread easily and most patients recover within a few weeks, but it can cause severe illness in some people. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab that falls off. PHE said that, as a precautionary measure, it is working with experts in the NHS to contact a number of people who were on the same flight as the patient. The body has not revealed whether the patient is a member of the military, or confirmed their gender. PHE said in a statement: “People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.” The organisation said passengers that are not contacted need take no action. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free, said: “Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. Most people recover within several weeks. “It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. “We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: “PHE and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported and infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/08/first-ever-case-of-monkeypox-recorded-in-the-uk"},
{"title": "Should we worry about monkeypox?", "author": "Alok Jha", "date": null, "text": "There's little reason to. Although at least 33 people have been infected with the virus in the American midwest and there is no treatment for it, experts believe they will all recover. The disease can kill though. The largest outbreak in Africa infected around 500 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997, killing at least five children.  This is the first time the virus, which comes from the same family as smallpox and cowpox, has appeared outside Africa. The infection was carried to the US by a Gambian giant pouched rat (above), which is thought to have passed the virus on to people via local prairie dogs.  The infection was first identified in a captive monkey around 30 years ago, although subsequent studies have shown the virus also infects other animals in central and west Africa, in particular rodents.  \"The name monkeypox sticks, but monkeys are not that important as reservoirs of the virus,\" says Paul Fine, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  \"For monkeys, it's their equivalent of smallpox,\" says Mike Skinner at the Institute for Animal Health. \"The indications are that it's not endemic in monkeys so they're getting it from something like rodents. We don't know what the main animal reservoir is in Africa.\"  People living in rural areas of west Africa are regularly exposed to the virus and infections are common.  Fine says the disease starts like many others with a fever and sometimes backache, coughs and a sweat. The symptoms develop with a rash, which starts as red spots that harden, blister, and finally become scabs.  While there is no treatment for monkeypox, anyone vaccinated against smallpox will be protected. In Africa, the fatality rate has reached 10% in the past, with children most at risk. \"It's not a highly transmissible virus,\" says Fine.  \"The key issue is if it gets out into the wild prairie dog population of the US,\" says Fine. If the virus becomes endemic in the millions of prairie dogs, the number of human infections would certainly rise, he says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jun/12/thisweekssciencequestions"}
