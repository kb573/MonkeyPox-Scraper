Up to July 28 there have been 2,469 confirmed cases of  the bug , new data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has revealed. On top of that, there are also 77 highly probable infections, bringing the total to 2,546. London  is still being hit hard by the outbreak and has 1,778 of the infections - up from 1,699 earlier this week. It's followed by the South East where there are 204 cases and the  North West , where there is 126. The East of England has 99, the  West Midlands , 69, the South West, 47,  Yorkshire  and the Humber, 44,  East Midlands  31 and the  North East  has 26. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, UEA said: \"Although the total number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in England are continuing to rise the number of new cases being reported in each week does now appear to be falling.   \"But there is a long way to go before we can relax as the risk of another surge in cases remains.” The rise in cases comes as a  new study  published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) revealed those catching the bug aren't displaying typical symptoms. Anus pain and swelling of the penis are some of the new signs patients are suffering with during this global epidemic of monkeypox.

The majority of the cases, about 98 percent, have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, the World Health Organization has previously said.  'CHECK YOURSELF' The WHO this week advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider \"reducing the number of sexual partners\" momentarily. Dr Sophia Makki, National Incident Director at UKHSA, warned people to check for  symptoms of monkeypox  - namely a rash or blisters on the skin - before having  sex . Close physical contact enables the virus to spread, hence why people are picking it up through sexual activity. But it is not defined as a  sexually tramismitted disease. People can also catch monkeypox from an infected person’s bed sheets or towels, or from their coughs or sneezes.  Dr Makki said: “Monkeypox cases continue to rise, with the virus being passed on predominantly in interconnected sexual networks.  “Before you have sex, go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters.  “If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician.” The UKHSA previously warned that monkeypox patients  should use condoms  for 12 weeks after they’ve had the bug.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19360661/major-monkeypox-update-cases-rise-painful-symptoms/"},

The man - with a rash on his legs - was photographed by a doctor in  Madrid  who was concerned for the welfare of other passengers. Dr Arturo Henriques, 32, claimed he spoke to the passenger, who didn't care that he was spreading the virus. But the man accused has since spoken to local media and categorically denied that the conversation took place. He said he suffers with a condition called neurofibromatosis, the symptoms of which may be mistaken for other rashes.  In now deleted Tweets, Dr Henriques is claimed to have said: \"The gentleman gets on the train at Legazpi station. Completely full of wounds from head to toe, including his hands. \"I see the situation and I also see people around him as if nothing will happen to them. \"I went up to the gentleman prudently and asked him what he was doing on the metro if he has monkeypox. \"His response: yes, I have it, but my doctor did not tell me I had to stay home. He only told me to use a mask.\" \"I tell him the wounds he has all over his body are what are most infectious.

To which he replied that I stop bothering him.\" Dr Henriques' thread racked up tens of thousands of likes on Twitter before his account went private.  The \"infected patient\" has since spoken to  20minutos , confirming his identity with the tattoo on his leg and pair of trainers in the photo. He said:  \"I don't have monkeypox and I didn't speak to him [Dr Henriques] at any time.\" The man says if he had been by Dr Henriques, he would have explained he had neurofibromatosis - as he often does to other people who are curious.  The man's legs are covered in a rash - which looks similar to the  tell-tale monkeypox rash . But it is in fact the symptoms of neurofibromatosis, a condition which causes tumours to grow along the nerves. The skin may have birthmark or freckle-type patches.  Get to know the monkeypox rash The monkeypox rash comes a few days after a person feels unwell with  symptoms  such as a fever, headache, muscle aches, back ache, chills or exhaustion. The rash tends to start on the face and hands before spreading to the limbs.  But in the current outbreak, experts have said the rash is more commonly  appearing on the gentials  than before.  The rash initially looks a little like chickenpox, and there may be many lesions or just a couple. Then the marks on the skin turn into pus-filled blisters. Experts wrote in the British Journal of Dermatology the most common skin lesions are  rare pseudo-pustules . With standard pustules, most of the time you can scrape away the top layer of the lesion, in order to get to the pus. But with pseudo-pustules, they are white and solid. Over time, these pseudo-pustules can become necrotic and lead to ulcers. And these blisters tend to just be in one location, rather than spread across the body. The NHS website says monkeypox can be passed on from person to person through any close physical contact with blisters or scabs. It can spread up until the rash has completely healed - when all scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed. Monkeypox can also be transmitted through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the virus. And even the coughs or sneezes of a person with monkeypox can be infectious. But the NHS adds: \"Anyone can get monkeypox. Though currently most cases have been in men who are  gay, bisexual or have sex with other men .\" The virus is generally passing between people during sexual activity. It has led health chiefs to warn men at risk of catching monkeypox to momentarily  limit sexual partners .  However, it does not mean it cannot spread to anyone outside the gay community, and it is not officially known as an  STI . Anyone can be infected with  monkeypox , regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity or sexuality.  But currently, it is spreading among the gay community. Spain  has been particularly badly-hit by the disease, where health chiefs have recorded 4,298 cases so far, and  two deaths .", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19398971/horrifying-image-train-passenger-riddled-monkeypox/"},

Medics said that both mum and baby are doing well after labour. Just  last month  experts warned that the continuous spread of the virus is worrying for certain groups of people. Pregnant women, the immunosuppressed and children are at high risk when it comes to monkeypox.

And instead of widespread rashes, some patients saw scattered or localized lesions in areas other than the face, hands, or feet. At times, flu-like symptoms developed after the rash, but other people didn't have those symptoms at all. Scientists have warned of unusual symptoms in US patients that were not previously associated with the virus. Some patients reported pain in or around the anus and rectum, rectal bleeding, proctitis (painful inflammation of the rectum lining), or the feeling of needing a bowel movement even though the bowels are empty.

Sharing her experience on  TikTok ,  Jacqueline  was forced to prove her chronic condition after cabin crew wrongly presumed she had  monkeypox .  Eczema  causes a  dry, red rash  on various parts of the body. Sometimes there are bleeding or scabbed over wounds. It is not contagious like monkeypox,  which has been spreading  for the first time in the UK, US, Europe and elsewhere since May. Monkeypox  causes lesions  on the skin that start looking like chickenpox, before turning into blisters that ulcerate, and turn into scabs. Jacqueline, who had gotten on a Spirit Airlines flight to the US, wrote: “They had me get off the plane in front of everyone along with my wife to interrogate me about the eczema I've had my whole life. “They asked me to provide medical documents and told my wife to watch her attitude.  “I’ve never been so humiliated in my life.” In another follow-up TikTok video she wrote: “We were able to board the flight again after I presented a tube of my prescribed eczema cream... \"My wife called out the CRO on being discriminatory (which is when she was told there was no need for an ‘attitude’.

Other users commented on her post that they feared being in public and having their skin condition, such as  acne  or  psoriasis , mistaken for monkeypox.

Around 2,468  infections  have been confirmed across the country - with at least 77 'highly probable' cases. An endemic state refers to a disease or condition regularly found amongst a population. While medics at the UK Health Security have urged Brits to stay calm, the US this week declared a  public health emergency  over  the virus . The declaration came after the  World Health Organization (WHO)  also called the outbreak a global emergency. Now, both politicians and LGBT+ groups have demanded the government increase its efforts to help curb the spread. Vaccines have already been rolled out in some parts, but the group has said this now must become a priority. In a letter penned to health secretary  Steve Barclay , the group said: \"We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. \"Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.” Signed by the LGBT+ groups for Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Scottish National Party, along with sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, the group said communication on the outbreak is key.

The agency said there is a “body of evidence” showing monkeypox is present in the semen of people infected. Dr Hugh Adler said transmission in households is \"possible, but not common, and certainly not like we would see with COVID, influenza, measles etc\". An expert in clinical science at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, he told The Sun: \"I think the vaccine campaign really needs to ramp up. \"We can still bring this to a close, but it will get more and more challenging the higher the number of cases we see.\" The NHS has launched  a vaccination programme , centred around the outbreak epicentre of London, to protect those most at risk. This includes men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men.  More than 95 per cent of the monkeypox cases so far in the UK have been in this group - with the same trend seen globally. Some 100,000 jabs will be available. Dr Makki said: “Vaccination will further strengthen our monkeypox response and so we urge all those who are eligible for the vaccine to take it up when offered.  “It will help protect yourself and others you have had close contact with.  “While the infection is mild for many, it can cause severe symptoms and hospitalisation in some.  “Please remember that the vaccine may not provide complete protection against monkeypox, so it is still important to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and call 111 or a sexual health clinic if you develop any.” The World Health Organization (WHO) said the monkeypox virus has reached more than 70 countries,  declaring it a global health emergency.   The surge in monkeypox infections is unusual because it is outside the West and Central African countries where it is endemic. The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days. Rashes subsequently appear on the face, palms of hands and soles of the feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs. The UKHSA updated its  official list of monkeypox symptoms  in light of new evidence. Experts said that just a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus and surrounding area, lesions in the mouth, and symptoms of anal rectal pain or bleeding can be a sign. They highlighted that this is a red flag especially if the individual has recently had a new sexual partner.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19325014/uk-monkeypox-cases-rise-brits-check-symptoms-before-sex/"},

Last month, health bodies estimated the outbreak was doubling in size about every two weeks, but the number of new infections has dropped in recent weeks. Harun, who lives in  London , first started to display  flu -like symptoms back in early June, such as high fever, chills and muscle aches. After having recently caught  Covid  he was “convinced” he had had the virus again, he told The Sun. “But every test I did came back negative.” A few days later, the charity worker developed a red and white rash on his body that resembled an allergic reaction, which he said was “nothing like the monkeypox pictures you see online”. It wasn’t until a few days later that he also noticed a painless spot on his nose which he assumed was a mosquito-like bite or pimple.  Harun works in sexual health so is well versed in monkeypox and its symptoms, but he had never seen his rash or spot associated with the disease and so didn’t think he could have it. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence A few days later, Harun's health took a turn for the worse as his fever reached 40C. “No amount of painkillers would ease the pain,” he said.  Despite his symptoms, Harun was struggling to be taken seriously by medics, who eventually gave him penicillin for tonsillitis - which he didn’t have. There was no suggestion from healthcare professionals that he had could be suffering monkeypox. Harun is living with  HIV , a virus which can damage cells in the immune system.  He takes medication which reduces the amount of HIV in his blood to a very low level, which keeps his immune system working and prevents illness.   His blood tests suggested he had a robust immune system at the time of his monkeypox infection. However, his GP suggested that his symptoms may be an indication that his medication isn’t working, which Harun said was “really scary”. It was at this point that Harun went to his sexual health clinic who suggested it could be monkeypox and sent him to A&E to get tested. “You never believe it could happen to you. I work in sexual health and I still didn’t think I could have it,” he said.  It was at this point that Harun developed swollen tonsils and a very sore throat.   “I couldn’t breathe, swallow or speak,” he said.  “I vividly remember calling up the hospital and crying in pain.\" Harun was finally referred to hospital where he was put into isolation.  His test confirmed he had monkeypox, and only then did lesions often associated with monkeypox begin to appear on his hands, legs, and feet. \"My throat was covered,\" he said, explaining that the lesion on his nose was bigger and became infected. Harun was transferred to a specialist hospital for treatment with an experimental drug that works for  smallpox , a related virus. “I was scared I would die alone in my hospital room,” he said. “I’d never been in so much pain in my life.” “I remember looking at a water bottle and crying because I couldn’t drink it,” he added.  Harun has now made a full recovery and has since called for the government to ramp up the vaccine process to get more people jabbed. “Many people can be symptomless and not display spots in obvious places. Or they may be very small like mine,\" he explained. “These people can easily and unwillingly end up passing the virus onto others. The faster we get the vaccine the faster we can stop it spreading.\" Harun also said that many people still mistakenly believe monkeypox is a gay disease.  \"Just because the disease is currently impacting the gay community, it doesn't mean only gay people can catch it,\" he explained.  \"I've had several straight people and straight couples contact me on social media to share their own experiences of monkeypox.\" Last week, both politicians and LGBT+ groups demanded the government increase its efforts to help curb the spread. Vaccines have already been rolled out in some parts, but the group has said this now must become a priority. In a letter penned to health secretary  Steve Barclay , the group said: \"We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. \"Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.” Signed by the LGBT+ groups for Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Scottish National Party, along with sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, the group said communication on the outbreak is key. The Terrence Higgins Trust said urgent political action is needed to get hold of the rise in cases. Vaccination  experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. In recent weeks, scientists have said new skin symptoms have been identified. Typical  signs of the illness  usually include a fever - along with swelling of the lymph nodes. But a new review of 185 cases published in the British Journal of Dermatology has found otherwise. Medics have now stated that the most common signs of this outbreak are rare pseudo-pustules. These are similar in appearance to pustules, with the main difference being that they are white and solid. With standard pustules, most of the time you can scrape away the top layer of the lesion, in order to get to the pus. Two deaths have now been recorded  in Europe.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19460234/thought-covid-but-was-monkeypox/"},

Medics have declared the outbreak a  global health emergency , with 2,208 cases having been detected in the UK so far. In the US there are currently 2,891 cases - with New York and California being the worst hit. New guidance issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged Brits to look out for any new lesions. Experts said that just a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus and surrounding area, lesions in the mouth, and symptoms of anal rectal pain or bleeding can be a sign. They highlighted that this is a red flag especially if the individual has recently had a new sexual partner. In most cases, infection usually starts with  symptoms  such as a fever and headache. Some people will also experience muscle aches, back ache, chills or exhaustion. This is usually followed by a rash a few days later. Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at UKHSA said medics are continuing to see cases that have been passed on primarly through close or sexual contact.

For many people symptoms can be mild but for some people, hospital treatment may be required.” There have been no deaths in the UK as of yet from the outbreak and medics said that most people can manage their symptoms at home. The update from the UKHSA comes after a study in The New England Journal of Medicine last week found that many who have  the bug  were experiencing symptoms not recognised. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Experts today said you should also look out for lesions in the mouth or around the anus  “These symptoms include single  genital lesions  and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. One in ten people had only a single skin lesion in the genital area, and 15 per cent had anal and/or rectal pain, Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said. The findings back those of a recent analysis of London cases, published in the  British Medical Journal. It said of the 54 cases, \"skin lesions on genitals appeared to be more common in this outbreak\", while fever and tiredness was less so. The concern is that these symptoms are being confused for other  sexually transmitted infections  (STIs), such as genital warts or  syphilis , or even cold sores. When cases slip through the net it makes containing the spread of the disease more challenging. The paper said: “The clinical symptoms are similar to those of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and can easily lead to misdiagnosis.  “In some people, anal and oral symptoms have led to people being admitted to hospital for management of pain and difficulties swallowing.  “This is why it’s so important that these new clinical symptoms be recognised and healthcare professionals be educated on how to identify and manage the disease – misdiagnosis can slow detection and thus hinder efforts to control the spread of the virus.  “The study will therefore lead to increased rates of diagnosis when persons from at-risk groups present with traditional STI symptoms.” Monkeypox is not an STI but is predominately spread through sex, given that it it transmits with close skin contact.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19313169/monkeypox-official-symptoms-cases-continue-rise/"},

These signs include issues with their stools and rashes in the tissue lining the mouth. Other patients have said rashes have caused them to experience pain in the anus and rectum and in some cases, rectal bleeding has occurred. Many have also had painful inflammation of the rectal lining - with others experiencing the sensation of having to poo when their bowels are actually empty. The World Health Organisation's Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"It’s now clear that there is an unusual situation, meaning even the virus is behaving unusually from how it used to behave in the past.\" Details from the CDC report state that for some people who have the bug, rashes have been either 'scattered or localised' to a specific part of the body.

A vaccine rollout has begun to try and keep a lid on the outbreak - which shows no signs of slowing. The  monkepox  caseload has gone up by 14 per cent in  three days , the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed. An additional 201 cases have been detected between July 4 and 7, bringing the total to 1,552.  The outbreak, which has been rumbling on since May, shows “no signs of a decline”, UKHSA said. Almost every identified person with the virus has been a gay or bisexual man. There is no evidence as of yet that  the bug  has spilled outside of this group, UKHSA said.  A vaccination programme is beginning, and sexual health services will offer the vaccine to anyone considered to be at higher risk of exposure.  “This includes people with a recent history of multiple partners, participating in group sex, attending sex on premises venues, or have recently had a bacterial sexually transmitted infection,” health chiefs said.

Its most characteristic symptoms is a  rash , causing blisters that scab over time. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “It’s concerning that we are continuing to see the outbreak grow and we urge the public to do all they can to help us slow the spread. “If you’ve recently had new or multiple sexual partners, please be vigilant to the  symptoms of monkeypox , and be aware that many of the cases we’re seeing are finding only a single, or few, lesions. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact.  “Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been reviewed by a clinician. “To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners. “If you are called forward for vaccination, we strongly recommend that you take it.” The average age of those infected is 36 years old, with London becoming the epicentre (75 per cent of cases). Monkeypox is a zoonotic infection that occurs mostly in West and Central Africa.  The handful of previous cases in the UK have been either imported from countries where monkeypox is usually found. But for the first time, the virus is spreading through parts of the population.  The rise in the UK comes as the US has also now recorded 700 cases of the bug.

Outbreaks across the globe were sparked in May and experts are still grappling with containing them. Today, the largest review of cases so far, spanning 16 countries, has been published.  It’s already apparent that  monkeypox  causes a flu-like illness, with  a rash spreading  from the face around the body in the days following. The rash looks similar to chickenpox, with the small spots (or lesions) becoming blisters before scabbing over. But reporting in the  The New England Journal of Medicine , scientists said many infected people were seen with “symptoms not recognised” by current monkeypox definitions. “These symptoms include single  genital lesions  and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said.

It comes after UK health officials warned of a “body of evidence” showing semen can contain monkeypox. It is not clear whether this means the virus can be spread via sex, however, Brits have been told to  use condoms for at least 12 weeks  after recovering.  Professor Chloe Orkin, Queen Mary University of London and Director of the SHARE collaborative, warned: “Viruses know no borders and monkey pox infections have now been described in 70 countries and in more than 13,000 people.” Vaccination programmes are being rolled out in order to protect the most vulnerable groups. The disease is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men, including more than 95 per cent of the cases in the UK. It comes as the NHS steps up its vaccination programme in London - the epicentre of the UK’s outbreak.  Of the 2,137  confirmed cases in the UK, 1,492 are in London. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine on Tuesday. And now, NHS England said thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted about getting their jab. Those at highest risk, such as primary contacts and healthcare workers, will be invited to come forward for a jab at one of the 18 clinics.  Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: “Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too. “As we have done with the most successful Covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19275340/new-monkeypox-symptoms-revealed/"},

Spain  has been particularly badly-hit by the disease, where health chiefs have recorded 4,298 cases so far. No further details are known about the people who have died. But the vast majority of those diagnosed with the disease in the country have been men. Just 64 female patients have been treated. The earliest cases, recorded in May , were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria. Last week, the World Health Organisation  declared monkeypox a global health emergency , after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. That means it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed. The WHO Director General said the risk globally was \"moderate\" but the health committee had decided to declare an emergency anyway. At the time of their announcement, more than 16,000 people had been infected with monkeypox and five people had died. Now, more than 19,000 cases have been confirmed with 1,778 infections in London alone as of yesterday. In the whole of the UK, cases have risen up to  2,469 confirmed infections on July 28. Medics have also recorded 77 \"highly probable\" infections, bringing the total to 2,546. Traditionally, symptoms of monkeypox have included  a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. Some victims also suffer from a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.

The decision comes one month after WHO declared monkeypox a global health emergency after more than 26,000 cases were reported in 87 countries.  What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is a rare disease that causes several symptoms and a distinctive bumpy rash.

Monkeypox can last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks, and while  WHO  says the monkeypox virus is similar to human smallpox, it can still be fatal.  So far, there have been five reported deaths worldwide, according to the University of Minnesota's  Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy .  Is there a vaccine for monkeypox?  While there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox in the United States, Biden stated that the smallpox vaccine is effective and that the country has enough “to deal with the likelihood of a problem,\" according to  USA Today .  “I just don't think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with Covid-19,” Biden said during a separate press conference.

In the US , infections have also been climbing with 351 being recorded by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC). So far, experts investigating the outbreak have said cases have been in adults, with the majority being  detected in men . Now the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that it is investigating reports of infections in two children in the UK as well as kids in France and Spain. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women.\" Monkeypox  is spread through close physical contact, meaning it's easily transmissible.

Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\", Dr Hopkins said, and are like \"a viral illness\". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. \"It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,\" Dr Hopkins said. \"They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious.\" Medics  say the fatality rate in children is between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. The  NHS  states that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms.

The hotspot is London, where 77 per cent of cases have been confirmed, data published by UKHSA today reveals. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “The monkeypox outbreak continues to grow.  “Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other  men who have sex with men. ” Ms Shepherd warned those who have plans over London Pride to enjoy so safely, echoing comments made  by local health chiefs in the city. She said: “This weekend, let’s enjoy  Pride  safely – before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “Please don’t attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell. If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested.  “Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks – especially if you are having sex with someone new.” She also urged people to keep the contact details of any sexual partners, in the event it will be needed for contact tracing. Last week Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UKHSA, said anyone attending “large events over the summer” to be aware of the symptoms.  The monkeypox outbreak is unusual because there have only been some seven cases in the UK in the years between 2018 and 2021. The sudden influx of cases coincides with a global spike. And experts are now concerned it will coincide with a  new Covid wave , and an unusually early flu season. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at UKHSA said she thought this year \"will be even more challenging than normal\",  The Telegraph  reported. The agency is watching Australia - in its winter - \"very, very carefully\" to predict what will happen in the UK. “They have had their worst influenza season for more than five years,\" Dr Susan said at a briefing, adding it started earlier. “While we normally don’t see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October – that’s what we’re planning for,\" she said. Dr Hopkins said at least one wave of  Covid  is expected this autumn-winter, and monkeypox should be expected to spread for at least \"the next six months\". Monkeypox does not spread easily between people. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth). Monkeypox can spread from person to person through: The illness begins with: Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops. It often begins in the face before spreading to other parts of the body.  The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off. An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The illness is usually mild and most of those infected will recover within a few weeks without treatment.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19062458/monkeypox-cases-jump-1235-infections-warning/"},

If you catch monkeypox you have to isolate for 21 days, and the group has called for more help for these people. Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of British Association of Sexual Health & HIV said monkeypox cases are currently doubling every 15 days and we have now reached a critical point in our ability to control its spread. \"Already-stretched sexual health services are buckling under the additional pressures that the outbreak is placing upon them, and an increasing volume of core sexual health care is being displaced as a result. “This has left us on the precipice of a fresh public health crisis, one which can only be averted with urgent, additional support,\" she added.

Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been reviewed by a clinician. “To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners. “If you are called forward for vaccination, we strongly recommend that you take it.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19172514/monkeypox-cases-continue-rise-infected-signs/"},
{"title": "I’m an expert – here’s everything you need to know about monkeypox in children", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "15:39, 4 Aug 2022", "text": "EXPERTS have revealed what parents need to know about the monkeypox outbreak, after cases in children have been confirmed. Four kids  in the  US  and one under 15-year-old male in the UK have been struck. The number of cases is very small compared to the larger epidemic, in which a few thousand people have been reported. But experts have warned that children under eight are at “high risk” of severe disease if they catch monkeypox. Monkeypox  usually causes a mild disease of flu-like symptoms and  a rash  which gets better on its own. It has a fatality rate of three to six per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Two deaths  have been reported in  Spain . Here is everything you need to know about the risk to your kids: Yes, children can get monkeypox. Jimmy Whitworth, an Emeritus Professor, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: “Anyone who comes into close contact with a case can become infected.\" Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Monkeypox can be spread through close skin-to-skin contact or through a secondary surface like clothing, bedding, or towels. It is transmitting differently in Western countries compared to  Africa  - where the virus is endemic. It is mostly spreading via close contact, typically during sex, throught  Europe , the US,  Canada  and elsewhere. Gay and bisexual men make up the majority of cases - but this does not mean it cannot spread outside this group. Dr Hugh Adler, an expert in clinical science at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: “Infection in children is relatively more common in African countries, where it typically is acquired via contact with wildlife. “If a high number of cases were seen in children, this would suggest that household or community transmission was widespread.  “Fortunately this is not currently the case in the UK or elsewhere in the current outbreak. “Household transmission is possible, but not common, certainly not like we would see with  Covid , influenza, measles etc.” The World Health Organizations says that severe cases occur more often in young children. The CDC has warned of preliminary evidence that has suggested children below the age of eight could develop a more severe reaction to the virus. Young children with eczema and other skin conditions, and children with immunocompromising conditions may also be at more risk for severe illness, according to the  CDC . In rare cases, the virus can result in encephalitis (brain swelling), pneumonia, sepsis, vision loss and more, the CDC reported. It is not clear why kids are more at risk - as are pregnant women and immunocompromised adults.  The most recent cases are in the state of Indiana, where health authorities reported two cases on August 2.  The  first two infected children  were a toddler in California and a non-US resident from the UK who was tested in the Washington DC area. Data from the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) also reveals that one under 15-year-old caught the bug sometime since the outbreak started in May. Kids and the public generally are at a low risk of catching the virus, health bosses say.  Prof Whitworth said that monkeypox is unlikely to cause an epidemic in the general population because “most people do not have very close contact with many different people”.  And Prof Adler said that if a child is infected, it is unlikely they’d be in school spreading it to other youngsters. “Sick children (including with monkeypox) would typically be kept at home rather than being out playing with other kids, indeed they probably would feel quite unwell in the early stages, and then be in isolation if they'd tested positive,\" he said.  If someone comes down with monkeypox, their first symptoms are likely to be similar to flu. They may have a high temperature, headache, muscle aches, swollen glands and exhaustion. A distinctive rash follows, which can be confused for chickenpox, scabies or hand, foot and mouth disease. But what start as flat, slightly raised spots turn into pus-filled blisters. These eventually burst or ulcerate and turn into scabs. The NHS says it’s unlikely to be monkeypox unless you have not been in close contact with someone who has the virus, or you have not recently travelled to west or central Africa.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19419742/everything-to-know-monkeypox-children/"},

Authorities are trying to halt an outbreak that has exploded across the  Canary Islands  - a tourist hotspot that attracts millions of visitors every year.  The Ministry of Health of the Government of the Canary Islands said a total of 96 cases have been confirmed.  Gran Canaria has recorded 65 cases, while Tenerife has confirmed 29 and Fuerteventura has detected two.  Another two suspected cases were detected yesterday, officials said.  They are all experiencing mild symptoms and are isolating at home,  El Dia  reports. It comes after  monkeypox cases in Spain and Italy were traced  to a festival in Gran Canaria in May attended by 80,000 revellers. Authorities investigated the festival after it was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. The Canaria Pride festival, held in the town of Maspalomas between May 5 and 15, became a hotspot for the monkeypox outbreak. The massive party was attended by over 80,000 people, including three Italian men who later tested positive for the virus.

There are now more than 15,000 monkeypox cases worldwide. Cases have now been detected in Israel, Norway, Thailand, Australia, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and Canada. Experts have warned that although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it could be  passed on through skin-to-skin contact during sex . Many known patients are gay men who were tested after going to STI clinics, the WHO said. Health chiefs warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . In the UK, the NHS is stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab come on stream. On Tuesday, the UK Health Security Agency said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine as monkeypox cases continue to rise. As of July 18, there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: \"While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. \"On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible.\" US officials have also ordered more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses - with several million more on order for the months ahead.  The WHO's emergency committee met on Thursday to consider for the second time within weeks whether to declare monkeypox a global crisis. African officials said they are already treating the continent's epidemic as an emergency.  But experts said the mild version of monkeypox in Europe, North America and beyond makes an emergency declaration unnecessary - even if the virus can't be stopped. ", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19276866/brit-holiday-warning-monkeypox-outbreak-canaries/"},

Now, medics have revealed that patients attending sexual health clinics in the capital are experiencing symptoms that have not been seen in previous outbreaks. Most people who get the illness will usually have cold and flu like symptoms such as a fever and  headache  - before a rash appears. Experts looked at 54  monkeypox  patients who tested positive during a 12 day period in May this year. They found that patients in London were predominately presenting with skin lesions in the genital area - with tiredness and fever being lesser symptoms compared with previous outbreaks. All the patients in the study were symptomatic and  presented with some sort of skin lesions Analysis found that 94 per cent had at least one skin lesion on the genital or perianal skin - signs that have not previously been noted.

She added: \"It is possible that at various stages of the infection monkeypox may mimic common STIs, such as herpes and syphilis, in its presentation.  \"It’s important that sexual health clinicians and patients are aware of the symptoms of monkeypox as misdiagnosis of the infection may prevent the opportunity for appropriate intervention and prevention of onward transmission.  \"Additional resources are urgently required to support services in managing this condition.” Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: Writing in the  The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal , experts said the  high prevalence of genital skin lesions in patients means sexual health clinics are set to see more cases of monkeypox in the future. Dr Nicolo Girometti, from the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"Currently, the UK and several other countries are seeing a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics, with no apparent links to countries where the disease is endemic. \"Monkeypox is a novel diagnosis within the sexual health setting and our study, the first to publish on cases from this UK outbreak, will support future case finding and clinical care.”  The report from the clinic in London comes days after medics in the US said doctors needed to be on the lookout for  less common signs of the illness. In the US there are currently with 460 cases with California being worst hit. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said some patients are experiencing these five symptoms: In a report from the CDC, medics explained that while rashes are common, they don't usually feature in the tissue in the lining of the mouth. Other patients have said rashes have caused them to experience pain in the anus and rectum and in some cases, rectal bleeding has occurred. Many have also had painful inflammation of the rectal lining - with others experiencing the sensation of having to poo when their bowels are actually empty. The World Health Organisation's Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"It’s now clear that there is an unusual situation, meaning even the virus is behaving unusually from how it used to behave in the past.\" Details from the CDC report state that for some people who have the bug, rashes have been either 'scattered or localised' to a specific part of the body. However, medics also stated that common flu-like symptoms that often occur with cases of monkeypox 'have not always occurred before the rash if they have occurred at all.'", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19097271/new-monkeypox-symptoms-discovered-signs-not-ignore/"},

It comes amid fears the virus can spread via semen, even when somebody is not showing signs of illness. The UK Health and Security Agency said on Friday there have now been 1,856 confirmed cases of  monkeypox  in the UK, as of July 15. The significant majority of these cases are in London, and almost always in  gay or bisexual men . UKHSA said there is a “body of evidence” showing  monkeypox  is present in the semen of people infected. In one man from Italy, viral particles were found in semen 11 days after the infection. Health officials said: “The evidence relating to the transmission of monkeypox through semen is limited at the present time. “In line with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance, UKHSA is now advising people to use condoms for 12 weeks after infection.  “This is a precaution to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to a partner.” It said people who were symptomatic were advised not to have sex at all.

UKHSA also said that some people who have recovered from monkeypox will need to get a PCR test on their semen. These people are those undergoing fertility treatment or who have an immunocomprised sexual partner. Vaccines are being given to people deemed the most at-risk of monkeypox - such as a person living with a patient. Gay and bisexual men are also being offered a vaccine in some cases if they attend sex parties or have multiple partners. UKHSA said overall, the number of monkeypox cases is small and the risk to the public remains low. The  virus is mild  and typically causes flu-like  symptoms , including a high temperature, headache and muscle aches, followed by a rash that starts on the face.  The rash  looks like chickenpox until blisters form.  Dr Hugh Adler, Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said it was reassuring that cases were not growing at an “exponential rate” in the UK. But he said: “Less reassuringly, the outbreak shows no signs of slowing down. “Overwhelmingly, men who have sex with men remain at highest risk currently.” Monkeypox has caused outbreaks in Africa for decades, but the recent explosion of cases outside of the continent has baffled experts. According to the WHO, the outbreak has reached 63 countries. “I am concerned by the increasing number of monkeypox cases in the  EU ,\" said EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides today. She added there were now over 7,000 cases reported in the EU, marking a nearly 50 per cent increase from last week. Nearly 1,500 cases have been identified in the  US  since the end of May, and similarly, these are almost all in gay and bisexual men. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says: “While many of those affected in the current global outbreaks are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has monkeypox can get the illness.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19236927/monkeypox-patients-condoms-fears-virus-spreads-via-semen/"},

The  World Health Organization  (WHO) is overseeing a review of the bug - which could see  the illness  called hMPXV. The illness was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research - hence the name monkeypox. The review from the WHO comes after 30 scientists  wrote a letter  calling for the change, over concerns it could provoke racism and stigmatisation. Anyone can get  monkeypox , and before the current outbreak, it was mostly found in African countries. But experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO said it was currently working with experts around the world on changing the name of the virus. In a letter to the organisation scientists said that \"continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising.\" The note continued: \"The most obvious manifestation of this is the use of photos of African patients to depict the pox lesions in mainstream media in the global north.\" Medics claim that the 'current narrative' is linking the  rise in cases  to Africa or West Africa, or Nigeria.

Dr Tedros also revealed that the WHO would be converging next week to discuss whether or not the outbreak will be given 'emergency status.' In recent weeks around 1,600 cases have been detected globally - something experts say is 'concerning'. In the US, the total number of infections that have been registered is 72, with California and New York having the majority of cases. \"For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,\" Dr Tedros said. In the UK there have been 524 detected cases, after 152 were confirmed today. Anyone can get the illness, with Brits being urged to visit a sexual health clinic if you have new  blisters or rashes . Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: A  technical briefing  issued the UKHSA on Friday found that the majority of cases are in London - with 99 per cent of them being in men. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. UKHSA admitted that \"traditional contact tracing is currently challenging\". Where gender information was available, 311 of 314 confirmed cases were male, with three confirmed female cases. Monkeypox  is not considered a  sexually transmitted infection  (STI). However, the data suggests that this is the primary way that the virus is spreading. The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

However, medics also stated that common flu-like symptoms that often occur with cases of monkeypox 'have not always occurred before the rash if they have occurred at all.' People who have contracted  monkeypox  will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Dr Tedros this week said that the WHO has become worried about the spread in cases globally. \"I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women,\" he told a briefing. Monkeypox  is spread through close physical contact, meaning it's easily transmissible. In the UK the majority of cases are in  London , and one health chief this week urged people to head caution when socialising. Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the outbreak in the UK is continuing to grow. \"We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. \"If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on. \"Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. \"However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk.\" Dr Makki said that if you are concerned you might have  the illness , then you should not got to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact.

Most people who get the bug will have a mild illness, but it can be particularly dangerous for the most vulnerable in society. So far, the majority of  cases  have been seen in men, but the infection is easily transmissible as it's passed through skin to skin contact. Experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) have this week warned that the continuous spread of the virus is worrying for certain groups of people. \"WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women.\" Pregnant women  are more susceptible to illness, due to the fact that their immune system is compromised. When you're pregnant, certain parts of your immune system are enhanced as you grow a fetus, while others are dampened. But during this time, your immune system is in a state of flux - as it constantly tries to keep up with your ever changing body. It's because of this that pregnant women are in danger, as they become more vulnerable to viruses such as monkeypox and  Covid-19 . Infections of the bug have now hit more than 3,400 globally.

In the US , infections have also been climbing with 351 being recorded by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC). The NHS states that the first signs of the illness include a high temperature, headaches and muscle aches. Many women experience aches, especially back ache during pregnancy, so if it's accompanied by other symptoms, you should seek medical attention. Other key symptoms include swollen glands, shivering and exhaution. However, The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said some patients are experiencing  unusual symptoms  such as issues with their stools and rashes in the tissue lining the mouth. In a report from the CDC, medics explained that while rashes are common, they don't usually feature in the tissue in the lining of the mouth.

{"title": "Monkeypox ‘not a gay disease,’ blast experts – after infected men reveal they are suffering debilitating pain & lesions", "author": null, "date": "0:06, 7 Jul 2022", "text": "EXPERTS have blasted the misconception that the monkeypox virus is \"a gay disease\" as it continues to spread throughout the US. The health officials are warning the public that sexual orientation does not affect your susceptibility to the virus.  While most cases of monkeypox in America and Europe involve gay and bisexual men, correlation, in this case, does not equal causation, experts say. \"This is not a gay disease,\" Fenway Institute medical research director Dr Ken Mayer told the  Boston Globe . The remarks come as the US has seen 605 confirmed monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases with 7,243 reported worldwide, according to CDC data. The virus appearing in queer males is a painful recall to the deadliest epidemic of the 1980s.  The spread of  human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) and autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) primarily through gay males in the 1980s made the disease that much deadlier due to stigmatization. Health officials are determined to not experience the same as monkeypox cases rise in the US and the UK. Mayer explained that the disease has largely stayed among men who have sex with men because that's where it began. If the virus first affected straight people, it would likely have remained among them, according to Mayer. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “It’s the social network phenomenon,” Mayer said. “It’s who you’re having contact with, not anything about the specific behavior.” Though rare, monkeypox spreads through skin to skin contact. This contributes to it being particularly vulnerable to men who visit sexual establishments such as bathhouses and sex workers. Health officials also stress the spread can just as easily happen via contaminated objects.  The onset of monkeypox often includes intense fever and headaches. However, for some, the disease festers into painful, very visible skin lesions.  The  CDC's  announcement of 53 cases of monkeypox near Washington DC alone has led to the introduction of two new vaccine sites. The number of vaccines available is limited, and  spots for vaccinations  at the sites fill up as quickly as they are offered.  Priority for vaccinations is being given to those whom monkeypox poses the highest threat.  The eligibility criteria for DC vaccinations includes gay and bisexual males, transgender women, non-binary, male-bodied individuals who are sexually active with other men. The eligibility is also extended to sex workers of any sexual orientation and gender, as well as those who are staff at establishments where sexual activities are engaged in regularly.  If you are displaying monkeypox symptoms or believe you have come into contact with the monkeypox virus, contact a local healthcare provider immediately.

Where information on gender was available, 1,033 cases were in males, with five being confirmed in females. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: The median age for those most affected is 36. Medics stated that the majority of cases are not in those who have documented travel to endemic countries - such as West Africa. In recent years, there have been just seven cases of monkeypox, between 2018 and 2021 in the UK. Of these, four were imported, with two cases having been household contacts and one had been a health care worker who had contact with an imported case. In the previous cases they had been no evidence of community transmission. The illness was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research - hence the name monkeypox. At present, England is deemed to be at a level two outbreak which means 'transmission within a defined sub-population with high number of close contacts'. However, the country is being monitored for signs of a level 3 outbreak, which means 'transmission within multiple sub-populations or larger sub-population'.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19027031/uk-monkeypox-cases-soar-health-officials-stay-at-home/"},

Navin Khosla, a Medical Writer at  NiceRx , told The Sun in an exclusive interview this week that the most common symptoms include high temperature, muscle aches, swollen glands, fatigue and shivering. “If you believe you might have monkeypox, then it’s vital you isolate and ring your doctor and explain your symptoms,\" Khosla said. \"They will talk you through the next steps and what you need to do in order to prevent the virus from transmitting to other people.” Many people are already hyper-vigilant of irregularities felt in the bodies or symptoms possibly connected to the coronavirus, Khosla said.  The same attention has to be shifted to potential monkeypox symptoms to stop the spread following this week's announcement that there are  more than 700 cases in the US. Unlike Covid, the spread is slower and symptoms are milder. Most importantly, there have been no reported deaths connected to monkeypox yet, according to the well-respected medical writer.  \"Although cases of monkeypox in the US are on the rise, it’s a rare disease and most people who contract the virus usually only suffer from mild symptoms which last around two to four weeks,\" he said. There's some concern that this can be a Covid 2.0 and turn into another global pandemic, but Kholsa said that doesn't appear to be the direction the disease is moving in.  \"Unlike Covid-19, the symptoms of monkeypox are a lot less mild and the cases have been a lot lower globally, so we would predict that monkeypox would not have the same effects as the covid-19 pandemic,\" he said.

He listed the main symptoms as: a high fever, muscle aches, swollen glands, fatigue and shivering. It's typically spread through human transmission and animals.  For humans, \"it’s important to avoid contact with any humans who are unwell,\" Kholsa said.  \"Refrain from sharing bedding, towels and other items they may have been in contact with.  \"It can spread quickly through the body and a rash typically spreads within 24 hours and becomes most concentrated on the face, arms and legs.” Animals are another medium of transmission.  “No matter how obscure this may sound, it’s important to stay away from any dead animals you may come across, whether that’s in the street or local woodlands,\" Kholsa said.  \"Stay away from animals which appear unwell because monkeypox can be transmitted through animals.

Here's what my experience has been like so far and why you should take it seriously. Trust me, you don't want to have it.\" When Matt first learned of the infection, he admitted that \"it seemed like a far-off problem in a vague world of potential inconveniences.\" It wasn't until June 17 that his friend tested positive and warned Matt that he might have been exposed through skin-to-skin contact. Matt immediately noticed some lesions his his \"underwear zone,\" he explains. \"The next day, I began to have intense flu-like symptoms: a fever, full-body chills, night sweats, a cough, a sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. This would last about a week,\" he writes. Days after his June 20 doctor's appointment, Matt learned he was positive for monkeypox and issued a stay-at-home order via email.

Matt said his flu-like symptoms slowly subsided and by June 24, a week after he first noticed lesions, he \"felt mostly normal.\" \"Thankfully, I’m feeling much better. At this point, it’s mostly a waiting game for the lesions to heal,\" he revealed via BuzzFeed. Days before his BuzzFeed article was published, the self-employed actor took to  Twitter  to urge his followers to get vaccinated against monkeypox as it is \"absolutely no joke.\" Matt suspects he was exposed to monkeypox approximately one week before his systems began. He tweeted: \"Started off with just a couple bumps, then developed intense flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, etc. \"Then those symptoms lessened and more spots appeared in various places on my body.

In a video  shared on TikTok , Matt explains: \"I think in total I counted 25 and there are also some in more sensitive areas which tend to be the most painful. \"They're so painful that I had to go to my doctor to get painkillers just to be able to sleep ... like really f***ing painful.\" 'CDC doing a lackluster job' In addition to explaining his symptoms, Matt said: \"And according to my doctor and this NPR article, the CDC is doing a really lackluster job of tracking how many cases there actually are, due to lags in testing and just generally not being on top of it.\" According to Matt, it took CDC officials three days to confirm he had tested positive for monkeypox. \"The government needs to pick up the pace on vaccines and testing,\" Matt wrote on Twitter. \"The slow response is pretty unacceptable.

The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) have secured another 100,000 vaccine doses to try and control the outbreak. Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: “ Monkeypox  is a rare and usually mild disease that does not spread easily between people. \"But we are taking action to help further manage the outbreak in the UK by procuring over 100,000 additional doses of vaccine. “The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine, and I would urge people to take up the offer as soon as they are contacted. “In the meantime, please contact a sexual health clinic if you notice any  unusual rashes  or lesions.” The  virus is mild  and typically causes flu-like  symptoms , including a high temperature, headache and muscle aches, followed by a rash that starts on the face. The rash  looks like chickenpox until blisters form. The virus has now been confirmed in 2,137 people as of July 18, after the bizarre outbreak started at the end of May. Most cases are in England (2,050), particularly London (1,492). Monkeypox  has caused outbreaks in Africa for decades, but the recent explosion of cases outside of the continent has baffled experts.

Gay and bisexual men are also being offered a vaccine in some cases if they attend sex parties or have multiple partners. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: “Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.” Dr Merav Kliner, Deputy Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow. “Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms. “While our advice on isolation is changing, monkeypox is still a serious public health challenge, and we urge contacts to take a break from any activities or events involving skin to skin contact.” Sex, hugging and kissing can all spread monkeypox from one person to another. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.  But it can be caught from touching the scabs of someone with the bug, touching their bed sheets or breathing in their respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing or kissing. It comes after the UKHSA warned that monkeypox patients  should use condoms  for 12 weeks after they’ve had the bug. The agency said there is a “body of evidence” showing monkeypox is present in the semen of people infected.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19253079/uk-monkeypox-cases-2000-government-stockpiles-vaccines/"},

Monkeypox is not an STI by nature, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. \"The spots, ulcers and blisters, which are most likely to pass on monkeypox, can appear on any part of the body, so condoms will not necessarily prevent transmission of the virus between two people who are in direct contact, including during sex. \"Although it is not clear if monkey pox can be transmitted through genital secretions, UKHSA is advising the precaution of using condoms for 8 weeks after a confirmed diagnosis of monkeypox. \"Monkeypox can also be passed on through contact with clothing, bedding and towels used by someone with monkeypox.\" The report also stated that recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within  Europe .

The report said that for the first time, the UKHSA has graded the outbreak on a levelling system. \"At present, England is judged to be in Level 2 and we are monitoring closely for any evidence of Level 3,\" it said. Level 2 is when there is \"transmission within a defined sub-population\", while Level 3 escalates to multiple or a larger population. Level 4 represents significant spread of the bug. The current outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments.  \"We use the new data rapidly to inform the public health response and we continue to work to reduce transmission.  \"We are grateful to all those who have come forward for testing and the patients who continue to help us understand the outbreak through participating in studies and investigations.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

In the  US , 113 cases have been confirmed, with New York and California being the worst hit places. Anyone can get  the illness  - more so if you have been in contact or had sexual contact with a person who has symptoms. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA said extensive contact tracing work has help stopped the spread of the bug. However, she added that medics are continuing to see a large proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. She added: \"By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. \"Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing.  \"The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet.\" In the meantime, she said that everyone should continue to be alert to any  new spots, ulcers or blisters  on any part of their body, particularly if they’ve had close contact with a new partner. \"If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending,\" Dr Ramsey added.

In the  East Midlands  there have been 8 confirmed, in the South West 6 and in the North East five. There are 142 cases under investigation in England - which means their addresses have not yet been confirmed, which in turn could make  contact tracing  difficult. Around 80 per cent of the infections have been found in London residents, with 624 having a reported home address.

The city of New York's  official website  revealed on Monday that 48 people across NYC tested positive for orthopoxvirus, all cases which are likely monkeypox, as of June 27, 2022. \"Most of these people have had mild illness, have not been hospitalized and have recovered on their own,\" the website explains.  \"Even with mild illness, the rash and sores from monkeypox can be itchy and painful.\" The website adds: \"Anyone can get and spread monkeypox. The current cases are primarily spreading among social networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, so this community is currently at greater risk of exposure.\" The spike in suspected monkeypox cases marks a 60 percent rise in just four days,  NBC New York  reports. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), as of 4pm ET Monday, the total confirmed number of  monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases  across the US reached 244. On Monday, California appeared to have the most cases in the country with 62 cases, with New York ranking second with 37, before the numbers increased. Other states with high numbers of cases are Florida, Illinois, District of Columbia, and Massachusetts, a  CDC map  reveals. Although cases are going up in New York City, vaccination slots are filled and the \"Health Department has not yet received additional doses and will not be able to offer more appointments yet,\" NYC.gov states.

And consider what we just went through with COVID-19, we should be much more prepared,\" NYC Council Member Erik Bottcher said in regards to the unavailable vaccines, according to NBC New York. The US confirmed its first case of  monkeypox  in a traveler who returned to  Massachusetts  from  Canada  on May 17. The CDC has released  new guidance  about how to identify monkeypox during the outbreak. Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The  symptoms are followed by a rash  that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet. However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. And instead of widespread rashes, some patients saw scattered or localized lesions in areas other than the face, hands, or feet. At times, flu-like symptoms developed after the rash, but other people didn't have those symptoms at all. Scientists have warned of unusual symptoms in US patients that were not previously associated with the virus. Some patients reported pain in or around the anus and rectum, rectal bleeding, proctitis (painful inflammation of the rectum lining), or the feeling of needing a bowel movement even though the bowels are empty. Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses like smallpox and most people recover within weeks, but the disease is fatal for up to 1 in 10 people, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, monkeypox cases have risen again in the UK with officials urging Brits to stay at home if they think they have the illness. There are now 1,076 infections across the country, an increase of 32 percent on figures reported on Friday. Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the outbreak in the UK is continuing to grow. \"We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. \"If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.\"", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19028671/monkeypox-cases-new-york-infections-nationwide/"},

Level 2 is when there is \"transmission within a defined sub-population\", while Level 3 escalates to multiple or a larger population. Level 4 represents significant spread of the bug. The current outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments.

Earlier this week it was revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) is currently looking into reports that the virus is  present in the semen of patients . In recent days, scientists say they have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany. Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said it was not known whether recent reports meant the monkeypox virus could be sexually transmitted. She said: \"This may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: \"We really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin-to-skin contact.\" Medics say you should contact a sexual health clinic if you have rashes or blisters and if you have been in contact with someone who has had monkeypox in the last three weeks. This guidance also applies to those who have been to West or Central Africa in the past three weeks. However,  the WHO are also set to rename the virus  - in a move which could see the illness called hMPXV. It comes after 30 scientists wrote a letter calling for the change, over concerns it could provoke racism and stigmatisation. The illness was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research - hence the name monkeypox. Experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk? Email us at  exclusive@the-sun.co.uk  or call  0207 782 4104 .

{"title": "I’m a monkeypox expert – from how it’s spread to protecting your family, here are the 13 things you need to know", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "21:00, 29 May 2022", "text": "FIRST came Covid, then a mysterious outbreak of hepatitis among kids and now monkeypox. It’s the latest health scare to send shivers down our spines, with words like “isolation” rearing their ugly heads once more. Monkeypox  is a rare viral disease typically seen in parts of central and west Africa, having been discovered in a colony of monkeys in 1958, and later in humans in 1970. On May 7, the UK Health Security Agency announced that a case had been detected in a patient who had  travelled to Britain from Nigeria . Since then cases have risen, with community spread and more than 300 cases outside Africa, according to the  World Health Organisation . More than 100 of those cases have been detected in the UK, with  one child ending up in intensive care  and infections confirmed across Europe and the US among other countries. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and  NHS  services. “If anyone suspects they have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111, or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though phone ahead before attending in person.” So, what is monkeypox, who is at risk and why are young men making up most of the cases so far? We asked Dr Amr Bayoumy, a virologist at Coventry University, to share everything you need to know. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence WHAT IS MONKEYPOX? LIKE coronavirus, monkeypox is what’s known as a zoonotic virus — meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. “Clinical symptoms are similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients,” Dr Amr says. “But while monkeypox is genetically similar to smallpox, it’s less severe.” Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, which just means that it’s consistently present, and accounts for some 9,000 cases a year. There are two strains, one originating from West Africa and most likely to be the one causing the global outbreak, and another from the Congo, which is more deadly. WHY IS IT CALLED MONKEYPOX? THE name suggests it originated from monkeys, but scientists can’t be certain. What they do know is where it was first identified. Dr Amr says: “Monkeypox was first isolated from lab monkeys in 1958, hence the name. However, the natural host is thought to be rodents such as rats, mice and squirrels, not monkeys.” In the 1970s, not long after the virus was discovered, it was first found in humans. HOW WILL I KNOW IF I’M AFFECTED? THE good news is that in most cases monkeypox is a mild disease and clears up on its own. Symptoms start between five and 21 days after a person is infected and can be mistaken for flu. Dr Amr tells Fab Daily: “Clinical symptoms include fever, headache, lymph node swelling and muscle aches. “Skin rashes usually start within one to three days after a fever. Symptoms can last two to four weeks, and in most cases a person will typically recover. “However, severe cases can be seen in children and people with compromised immune systems.” CAN PEOPLE DIE? IT’s been referred to as a “cousin” of smallpox, which is enough to instil fear because smallpox killed millions before it was eradicated in the 1980s, thanks to vaccines. However, monkeypox is less severe and less deadly. Dr Amr says: “The case fatality is three to six per cent, with fatalities higher in young children.” That’s for the Congo strain, the West African strain’s fatality rate is thought to be about one per cent. HOW WORRIED SHOULD I BE? MONKEYPOX is “not another Covid”, Dr Amr says, reassuringly. Unlike Covid, this virus doesn’t spread or mutate as quickly. And Dr Amr says transmission among humans is “not efficient”, with most people passing it on to less than one other person, meaning its R rate is less than one. “Transmission requires prolonged direct contact with an infected individual or his or her recently contaminated objects,” Dr Amr says. “Coronavirus is transmitted by breathing in contaminated droplets.” HOW DOES IT SPREAD? IN most cases a person is infected after coming into contact with an infected animal, but it can also be transmitted through close contact  with a person which appears to be the main source in this outbreak. Dr Amr explains this can happen if you touch the skin lesions of an infected person, or objects they have contaminated “such as bedding, towels or clothes”. IS IT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED? MONKEYPOX is not thought to be sexually transmitted in the traditional sense. But, it can be passed through sexual contact. You are contagious with the disease until scabs that form over a rash fall off. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said more research is needed to “better understand” if it could spread through sex via semen and vaginal fluid. WHO IS AT HIGHEST RISK? ANYONE who comes into close contact with an infected person is most risk. If you’ve recently travelled to West or Central Africa, you’re deemed higher risk too. But in general, Dr Amr says younger people are more likely to catch it. “People younger than 40 to 50 years old (depending on the country they live) may be more susceptible due to the end of smallpox vaccination campaigns globally in the 1980s,” he says. UK health chiefs have warned that so far a disproportionate number of cases have been detected in gay and bisexual men. That does not mean it’s a “gay disease”, TV doctor Ranj Singh told Attitude Magazine. Dr Ranj said men who have sex with men (MSM) are not at fault, but it might be that the first cases were detected in MSM networks. “This community should be on increased alert,” he added. The WHO added that cases in gay and bisexual men might be “because of positive health-seeking behaviour in this demographic”, as lots of cases have been detected at sexual health clinics. The WHO added: “Anyone who has close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox is at risk, regardless of who they choose to have sex with or any other factor. “Stigmatising people because of an illness is unacceptable.” ARE MY KIDS AT RISK? ONE child in the UK has ended up in intensive care with monkeypox. Official guidance states there are four groups at risk of severe disease: newborns, children, people who are immunocompromised and health workers. Seek help if you’re worried about your child. HOW CAN I PROTECT MY FAMILY? IF you know someone with monkeypox, avoid close contact. The Government says anyone with direct or household contact with a confirmed case should isolate for 21 days. Dr Amr says: “Avoid sharing bedding, towels or clothes. Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Avoid contact with pet rodents which may have monkeypox. “In 2003, the first outbreak outside Africa was linked to pet prairie dogs, a type of squirrel.” WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK I HAVE IT? DR Amr says: “Contact the NHS or your GP. Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people until you have been told what to do.” IS THERE A VACCINE? THE short answer is yes. Studies have shown the smallpox vaccine is around 85 per cent effective against monkeypox. “The smallpox vaccine is no longer available for the general public,” Dr Amr says. “But prior smallpox vaccination may result in milder illness.” The Government has stockpiled doses and close contacts of confirmed patients are being jabbed in a strategy known as “ring vaccination”. Dr Amr says: “Everyone who has been exposed to a patient receives the vaccine. “Ring vaccination requires complete and rapid surveillance and epidemiologic case investigation.” This strategy has worked for previous outbreaks of monkeypox. CAN IT BE TREATED? AN antiviral medicine known as tecovirimat has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms and infectiousness. It was licensed for monkeypox in Europe in 2022, but Dr Amr says it is not yet widely available. Most people recover by themselves without serious complications. Dr Amr adds: “The authorities are not powerless against monkeypox. We already have the tools — vaccines and medicines — to control infections.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18718452/monkeypox-expert-need-know/"},
{"title": "How to tell the difference between chickenpox and monkeypox", "author": "Terri-Ann Williams", "date": "12:33, 30 May 2022", "text": "CASES of monkeypox are on the up in the UK, with 106 infections having been identified in the country. The illness can cause a rash on the body alongside symptoms such as fever and  headaches . It's these signs that are similar to a common illness that children often get -  chickenpox . Just last month parents were warned of a  dangerous outbreak  of chickenpox and  scarlet fever infections . Experts say that many common infections declined during  lockdown  but they're now circulating at higher levels, particularly affecting pre-school and nurseries. But what are the main differences between  monkeypox  and chicken pox, and what should you be on the look out for? Monkeypox Monkeypox is a rare disease that causes outbreaks in Africa. But unusually, it has started spreading across a number of untouched countries in Europe and the Americas. While  monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. About six per cent of cases are fatal, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Symptoms  usually last between five and 21 days after exposure. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence They start off similar to flu. But then  a rash  breaks out, starting on the face. Initial symptoms include: fever headache backache exhaustion An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. What starts as a seemingly harmless red rash - which looks like chickenpox - evolves into angry blisters that can last several days. The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. If it spreads to the eyes it can cause blindness. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. Medics have urged people who think they have monkeypox to  visit a sexual health clinic  rather than call 111. Head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Mateo Prochazka wants 111 staff to be able to focus on handling other health queries.  Chickenpox The main difference between the two is that chickenpox will not usually cause a headache and swollen lymph nodes. Chickenpox is another highly infectious infection caused by the varicella zoster virus, and presents itself with a characteristic rash, with vesicles on the face, spreading down over the body to the arms and legs. Although generally mild in otherwise healthy children, it can be more severe in  pregnant women  and immuno-suppressed individuals. Children with chickenpox should remain at home until they are better and the rash has gone. It's a very itchy condition and can make little ones feel miserable, even if they don't have very many spots. Before a rash appears, you might get a high temperature, aches and pains with a general feeling of illness and a loss of appetite. Adults who get chickenpox will usually have symptoms for longer and in most cases will have more spots. The  NHS  says that it is possible to get chickenpox more than once but that this is unusual. If you are worried about any of your signs and symptoms you should call 111 for advice. In an emergency, always dial 999. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

It comes as Brits have been warned to  stay away from their loved ones  if they become infected under new rules. So far,  321 cases of the illness  have been detected in the UK, after another 18 were announced on Wednesday. Now the  World Health Organization  (WHO), has said the risk of the bug becoming non-endemic in some countries is starting to materialise. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the rise in cases was clearly concerning. Speaking at a press conference he said: \"The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic countries is real. \"More than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox have now been reported to WHO from 29 countries that are not endemic for the disease. \"So far, no deaths have been reported in these countries. Cases have been reported mainly, but not only, among men who have sex with men. \"Some countries are now beginning to report cases of apparent community transmission, including some cases in women.\" Medics as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said anyone can get monkeypox - particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual  with symptoms .

Dr Tedros added that the WHO is particularly concerned about the risk the virus poses to vulnerable groups, including children and  pregnant women . The WHO is set to issue further guidance in the coming days on  infection control . In the UK, chiefs have already taken measures to curb the spread - with medics urging anyone with symptoms to visit a sexual health clinic. As cases of  the bug  continue to rise - Brits now have to stay one metre apart from those who are infected. Where possible, experts have urged people to sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms. If this isn't possible, cases should avoid physical contact and keep at least three steps or one metre away from all household members. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: Other guidance states that you should keep laundry separate from other households and avoid close contacts with pets. Anyone can get monkeypox - particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. You should also get checked if you have been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past three weeks. The same applies if you have been to West or Central African in the past three weeks. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at UKHSA said: “Self-isolation is an important measure for protecting others from Monkeypox. “Staying at home and doing all we can to avoid close contact with other people in the household will prevent the spread of this virus. “We know that self-isolation is not easy for some so it’s important that people ask for support if needed.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

{"title": "British Airway crew member struck down with monkeypox – sparking massive delay to London-bound flight", "author": "Stephen Moyes", "date": "19:22, 21 Jun 2022", "text": "A DIPLOMATIC incident was brewing today after a British Airways crew member was struck down by monkeypox in Singapore. Government officials were in talks with authorities in Asia after they demanded the steward’s entire crew quarantine alongside their infected colleague for 21 days. BA  and the Home Office were trying to get permission to charter a plane to bring the rest of the staff home for further testing. Flight BA16 back to London was delayed for six hours today while the legal wrangle unfolded. The infected crew member had worked on the flight out from  Heathrow  to  Singapore , before completing the leg from  Asia  to  Sydney . He enjoyed downtime in Oz with the rest of his airline pals. But after the return flight from  Australia  to Singapore, the steward tested positive for monkeypox. It meant he was immediately quarantined and banned from working on the final return flight to  London . But a row broke out when Singapore authorities insisted a further nine crew and two technical BA staff also remain there in quarantine. A source said last night: “BA is desperate to bring its workforce home and have them in quarantine in Britain if needs be.

Passenger Tan Lay-Kok hit out online: “Got an unpleasant surprise when I checked my upcoming booking on BA16 from SIN to LHR to find it will be delayed by 6 hours.” A second unaffected BA crew in Singapore was due to work on the delayed flight back to the UK while the row continued behind the scenes. As of June 20, there are 793 confirmed infections in the UK. Of these cases, 766 are in England, 18 are in Scotland, three are in Northern Ireland and six are in Wales. In recent weeks around 2,103 cases have been detected globally, the most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) states. Anyone can get the illness - more so if you have been in contact or had sexual contact with a person who has symptoms. Health Promotion Specialist at Terrence Higgins Trust, Alex Sparrow, said a new targeted vaccination programme is a positive move. Data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK. A British Airways spokesperson told The Sun this evening: “We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require. \"We’re in contact with our crew and providing the necessary support.

While the infection spread is still on a relatively small scale, one man has now revealed he was one of the first to catch the illness. Yesterday it was reported that a  further 73 cases  were detected - all of which are in the last month alone. Most cases of  monkeypox  are in England (287), followed by Scotland (10), Wales (three) and Northern Ireland (two). Medics have also said that the majority of the cases have been detected in London and in gay men. Speaking for the first time, George (not his real name) has revealed that he was one of the first to contract the bug in the capital. The healthcare worker said he initially had been  suffering with a fever , lower back pain, and also had swollen lymph nodes. George, who identifies as gay, said he also had a rash and a black lesion on his groin, alongside little spot-like sores that had sprouted across his body. Speaking to  The Telegraph , he said he had no idea what it was and at first, thought it was a  sexually transmitted infection .

He said it was the 'most famous' gay sauna in the city, and said while he didn't have unprotected sex - he was intimate with others. After his diagnosis he told his flatmates, who then had gloves and masks on and also asked him to wear the same protective gear. Luckily, he was offered a room at the Royal London and spent nine nights isolating there before being moved to Liverpool for five nights to make more space for people in the capital. George said he got the all clear three weeks after a positive test. While he is now fully recovered and was able to celebrate the  Platinum Jubilee , he said he has suffered stigma because of the infection. He added that there have already been some homophobic remarks. with some people assuming he got monkeypox from having unprotected sex. Because of this, he said he's worried about public perception.

{"title": "Monkeypox UK symptoms LIVE:  Virus outbreak could be ‘tip of the iceberg’, WHO warns as 257 confirmed cases worldwide", "author": "Milica Cosic", "date": ": 12:52, 30 May 2022", "text": "THE WORLD Health Organization has warned that the monkeypox cases found in recent weeks could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are  many more cases that are undetected  in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said on Friday. Since the UK first reported a confirmed  monkeypox  case on 7 May, over 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency. The World Health Organization has received reports of 257 confirmed monkeypox cases and about 120 suspected cases in 23 nations where the virus is not endemic as of Thursday, it said in a Sunday update. Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday, while Argentina confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in Latin America on Friday. “We are still at the  very, very beginning of this event ,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva.  “We know that  we will have more cases in the coming days ,” she said, but stressed there was no need to panic. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” More than 100 of those cases have been detected in the UK, with  one child ending up in intensive care  and infections confirmed across Europe and the US among other countries. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and  NHS  services. “If anyone suspects they have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111, or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though phone ahead before attending in person.” So, what is monkeypox, who is at risk and why are young men making up most of the cases so far?

THE WORLD Health Organization has warned that the monkeypox cases found in recent weeks could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are  many more cases that are undetected  in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said on Friday. Since the UK first reported a confirmed  monkeypox  case on 7 May, over 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency. The World Health Organization has received reports of 257 confirmed monkeypox cases and about 120 suspected cases in 23 nations where the virus is not endemic as of Thursday, it said in a Sunday update. Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday, while Argentina confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in Latin America on Friday. “We are still at the  very, very beginning of this event ,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva. “We know that  we will have more cases in the coming days ,” she said, but stressed there was no need to panic. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population “remains low”. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness. The rare virus has also spread across 20 countries in Europe, with  Brits already warned to be “alert” when they hit holiday hotspots  this year.  The full list of European countries with confirmed monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have reported cases And elsewhere in the world: A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual. Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox. It is possible to become infected by touching the clothes or bed sheets which have been used by someone with Monkeypox. This means that the danger of contracting the disease is low, with around 20 cases confirmed in the UK currently. If you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. Monkeypox  comes from the same family of viruses as  smallpox  but is much less severe. No deaths have been reported  from the 2022 outbreak of the disease in the UK. The chance of catching monkeypox in the UK is very low as  cases are rare. Cases have been linked to some  festivals in Europe . According to the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) up to a tenth of people who contract the virus may die but this is mainly in younger age groups. The majority of those who catch monkeypox will survive. So, if you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. Read more  here . A rash  which looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters, and then scabbing, is the main  symptom of monkeypox .  It appears a couple of days after flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache and chills.  Professor David Heymann, the former head of WHO’s emergencies department, said it’s known that monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, “and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission”. But he said there was unlikely to be widespread transmission of the virus, and the outbreak might be traceable to a single infection. While the monkeypox is concerning experts, they have reassured it is “not another Covid”. Professor David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO’s emergencies department, said it does not spread in the air – although can be passed from sneezing and coughing – and we have vaccines to protect against it. The UK is  stockpiling  jabs against the virus which will only be given to those who are deemed at high risk after being in contact with a case. The vaccine was designed to fight smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, before being discontinued. But it is also 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, given they are similar viruses of the same family – although the former is more mild. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said Monday there were no plans for an “at scale” vaccination programme in the UK. It comes after  a British tourist  staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is tested for monkeypox. The holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura is one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed, health chiefs in the region said. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia said the number of beds available depends on how many cases would need that level of care. He said: “The concern is that in the 2018 outbreak, the case infected a health worker and that was thought to be while they were changing the bedding because the flakes from their scabs were spread.  “Patients have to be kept in the specialist unit to avoid the spread.” An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS has tried and tested plans in place for treating sporadic cases of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, through a network of highly specialised centres providing expert care. “The NHS is working closely with UKHSA to ensure the small number of people identified are treated in line with their guidance.” THE NHS only has enough space to treat 50 monkeypox patients, as cases continue to rise in the UK. Guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) states that all confirmed cases need to be transferred to high consequence infectious disease (HCID) units if they need hospital care. But just 15 beds are believed to have existed before Covid- with the spread of the virus ramping up capacity. Now sources say there are only 50 beds and many people will have to quarantine at home, the  MailOnline  reported. Experts said there is ‘always a risk beds will run out’, especially if the situation ‘deteriorates further’. It’s unclear whether the HCID units were kept following the pandemic, with many centres having being closed. Around 57 Brits have the illness, with more cases having been announced yesterday. Number 10 is ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation – but travel restrictions have been ruled out. The World Health Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said: “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities.” Monkeypox is related to smallpox, a deadly disease that was eradicated in 1980. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday published recommendations by its group of independent experts on a smallpox vaccine that limit its use to only people who work closely with viruses such as monkeypox. The Jynneos vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, will be available for the recommended groups at a time when monkeypox infections are spreading in Europe, United States and beyond. The publication of the vote by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which took place in November last year, formalizes the recommendations. A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is expecting more cases of monkeypox in the coming days as public health officials intensify their efforts to contain a virus that originates in the jungles of west and central Africa. The HSE is attempting to trace people who may have been exposed to the virus by a man from the east of the country who tested positive on Friday after presenting with symptoms. The results of tests on a suspected second case are awaited. The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland recorded its first case on Thursday and is expecting more in the weeks ahead. In a statement yesterday the HSE said people infected with monkeypox usually recover within weeks, though it warned that severe illness might occur in those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and babies. There is no known cure. Kim Roberts, an assistant professor of virology at Trinity College Dublin, said more cases are almost certain as it can take up to seven days, and sometimes weeks, for symptoms to develop after exposure. \"This means it can take longer to identify cases at this stage, but also that public-health teams have time to identify first contacts and break the rate of transmission. I would expect the numbers across the different countries which have expe- rienced outbreaks to go up in the coming weeks and months, but then fall as public-health teams break the transmission cycle,\" she said. Covid-19 hospital cases have fallen to their lowest rate since last summer, an expert has said. Professor Linda Bauld said on Friday that daily hospital cases with the virus had dropped to less than 50, the first time the figure has dropped so low in almost a year. She also added there were \"about 650\" people in hospital with the virus, compared to more than 2,000 last month. \"We've seen a significant decline in levels of infection in the community,\" she told BBC Radio Scotland on Friday. \"The (Office for National Statistics) infection survey will have some results out today that shows another drop.\" She added: \"That R number - which nobody is hearing about any more, but is still with us - is well below ... it's between 0.7 and 0.9.\" However, Prof Bauld stressed that the virus had not gone away and the potential for new variants continues. The Omicron variant, which spread aggressively during the winter, caused a surge in cases. \"We're not saying that everything's over because we may see new variants, and we may see surges in infection again, but we do seem to be in a much more stable situation,\" she said. An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. What starts as a seemingly harmless red rash – which looks like chickenpox – evolves into angry blisters that can last several days. The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. If the rash spreads to the eyes it can cause blindness. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. Symptoms generally last from 14 to 21 days, with severe cases relating to age, the extent of virus exposure, the patient’s health and the severity of complications. Doctors and the public have been warned to keep an eye out for unexplained rashes. Monkeypox causes symptoms  between five and 21 days after exposure. The symptoms of monkeypox start off similar to flu. But then  a rash  breaks out, starting on the face. Initial symptoms include: fever headache backache exhaustion SEVERE monkeypox patients may be infectious for up to ten weeks, scientists fear. An investigation of previous patients who had  the disease  found one man tested positive more than 70 days after he first showed symptoms. It comes as cases of the virus  reach 71 in the UK , and health officials have urged people to stay alert to symptoms. Signs of the disease  in the early stages include fever, headache, chills, back and muscle aches. Patients are contagious until their scabs fall off, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) says, and the scabs themselves can contain viral material. However, the latest study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggests people may be infectious long after their rash has settled. Study author Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved.  “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.” Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual. Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox.

Read the article in full  here . Mexico on Saturday reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the country, according to deputy health secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell. The patient was a 50-year-old permanent resident of New York who is being treated in Mexico City, Lopez-Gatell said on Twitter. \"He was probably infected in the Netherlands,\" Lopez-Gatell wrote, adding that the patient was being isolated and was in stable condition. The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Dr Carlos Maluquer de Motes, Reader in Molecular Virology, University of Surrey, said: “Isolation is one of the most effective measures to contain the spread of a disease, particularly a viral disease, because it limits the number of susceptible individuals that can be exposed to the virus. “Isolation of confirmed cases and the identification and vaccination of all their close contacts creates a circle of protected people around a positive case that is very effective in breaking chains of transmission. “This ‘ring vaccination’ strategy was successfully used to eradicate smallpox, so it is a proven strategy to contain poxvirus disease.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18691376/monkeypox-virus-uk-symptoms-live-cases-death-rate/"},

It comes as today  a further 52 cases of monkeypox were detected  in the UK, raising the total to 524 infections. In recent weeks around 1,600 cases have been detected globally - something experts say is 'concerning'. And now the WHO is exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted. Many cases in the current monkeypox outbreak are among sexual partners who have had close contact. The agency reiterated that virus is mainly transmitted via close interpersonal contact. In recent days, scientists say they have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany. Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said it was not known whether recent reports meant the monkeypox virus could be sexually transmitted. She said: \"This may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence \"We really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin-to-skin contact.\" Medics say you should contact a sexual health clinic if you have rashes or blisters and if you have been in contact with someone who has had monkeypox in the last three weeks. This guidance also applies to those who have been to West or Central Africa in the past three weeks. However,  the WHO are also set to rename the virus  - in a move which could see the illness called hMPXV. It comes after 30 scientists wrote a letter calling for the change, over concerns it could provoke racism and stigmatisation. Anyone can get monkeypox, and before the current outbreak, it was mostly found in African countries. But experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. In a letter to the organisation scientists said that \"continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising.\" The note continued: \"The most obvious manifestation of this is the use of photos of African patients to depict the pox lesions in mainstream media in the global north.\"", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18899513/traces-of-monkeypox-semen-who-investigation/"},

James McFadzean, 35, was left feeling \"rough\" after contracting  the virus  on May 25 following a trip to Dubai. But he told  TalkTV's  Tom Newton-Dunn how the UK Health Security Agency never responded to his phone calls - despite testing positive two weeks ago before cases  exploded to over 300 in the UK . The HR manager fumed: \"Not until ten minutes ago when my story broke, all of a sudden they found my right phone number which seems farcical! \"Every day I have been calling my clinic, the NHS Trust trying to get people to call me so we can do contact tracing.\" The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) says it made multiple attempts to contact James.  James, from London, is the  first Brit to go public with the disease  which leaves sufferers with fluid-filled blisters that appear like chicken pox, but James didn't get these. But he fumed that he can \"only wonder\" how long contact tracers will take to get in contact with the now hundreds of cases in the UK if they had \"trouble\" containing it when there were small numbers. The rare infection - mainly found in parts of west or central Africa - has now struck down 302 Brits who have been asked to isolate. The first case in the UK was recorded on April 29. There have been no deaths anywhere during the latest outbreak.

Own the mistake, say we're getting on it and do better\", he added. There have been no reported deaths in the UK from the disease which sees suffers develop flu-like symptoms within one to five days of contracting it. James said he didn't think he had the disease at first, but then his symptoms kicked in. He explained: \"It was very rough for the first week but now I feel fit and well and back to normal health. The first symptoms of monkeypox include (NHS advice): \"Everything you hear, everything you read talks about this telltale rash, or lumps or pimples which I never had at any point of the illness. \"I felt ill much like a flu: fever, very exhausted, back pain\". James explained he consulted a local clinic who said he should go for a Monkeypox test which turned out positive. But he never developed the trademark \"pox\" which he explained made it hard to understand when he was going to get over the disease and it left doctors confused, he claimed. Dr Yimmy Chow, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, UKHSA said: “We’ve made multiple attempts to reach this individual by phone and email and would urge them to contact the London Health Protection Team as soon as possible. “Anyone who suspects they might have Monkeypox, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, should limit their contact with other people and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as they can.” You can catch monkeypox from an infected animal if you're bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters, or scabs, the NHS says. Every day I have been calling my clinic, the NHS Trust trying to get people to call me so we can do contact tracing Severe cases can occur and in recent times, the case fatality ratio has been around 3–6%, according to the World Health Organization.  The infection can be transferred through sex and touching items that an infected person has come into contact with. If your symptoms are severe or you're at higher risk of getting seriously ill you may need to stay in a specialist hospital until you recover.

In the UK there have been 190 detected infections, and while the risk to the public remains low, experts have urged people to get to know the key signs of the monkeypox rash. As we head into the summer months and Brits spend more time out and about, our skin can feel the impact.

Fluid filled spots that later become crusty: Monkeypox Initial signs of monkeypox include a fever,  headache  and muscle aches. A monkyepox rash will usually start of the face, before moving across the rest of the body. A rash will occur within three days after a fever. Ifti Khan,  Well Pharmacy  superintendent explained: \"There are several stages to monkeypox. The first developing into papules and fluid filled pustules before forming a scab and falling off. Monkeypox lesions appear and develop at the same time.\" 2. Red or pink spots everywhere: Chickenpox Just last month parents were warned of a  dangerous outbreak  of chickenpox and  scarlet fever infections  - with many families being on high alert. Experts say that many common infections declined during  lockdown  but they're now circulating at higher levels, particularly affecting pre-school and nurseries. Mr Khan said: \"Chickenpox and monkeypox are similar in the way they are spread, via close contact and respiratory droplets, as well as direct contact with contaminated objects, but monkeypox is much rarer and spreads less easily.\" One of the  differences between monkeypox and chickenpox  is that people with the latter will usually not experience swollen lymph nodes. \"Chickenpox usually forms in a different way. \"In a chickenpox rash the spots do not develop uniformly and appear at different times,\" he added. 4. A patchy red rash that can turn scaly: Lymphoma Mycosis fungoides is a common rash in patients diagnosed with lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system - the network of tissues and organs in our body that work to rid us of toxins. It can be particularly dangerous because the cancerous cells can travel through the body in the bloodstream. The cancer cells can then grow in several places at once, affecting multiple parts of the body. A person with lymphoma may develop mycosis fungoides, a rash that is caused when the blood travels to the upper layer of the skin. In its early stages it may appear as a patchy red rash but as it progresses it tends to become scaly. It may be itchy and look  similar to eczema. 5. Tiny red spots covering the skin: Leukaemia Leukaemia, a type of  blood cancer  that starts in the bone marrow, can spread throughout the body in the bloodstream. A person with leukaemia may also develop tiny red spots on their skin known as petechiae. The rash is caused by broken blood vessels under the skin. Children may also develop a rash called acute myelogenous leukaemia, which causes dark spots to appear on the skin. 7. Reddish rash on your hands or back: Any cancer Dermatomyositis tends to appear as changes around your nail folds, a reddish rash on the back of your hands, especially around the knuckles, and a shawl-like red rash on your back. This rash can be associated with any type of cancer. It can also appear on your face, eyelids, chest, knees and elbows. Dermatomyositis can also cause muscle weakness and inflamed muscles. 8. Dark, thicker patches of skin: Cancer or diabetes Acanthosis nigricans is when darker, thickened patches of skin develop around the armpit, groin and neck. It's not a condition in itself but a sign of an underlying health problem. The patches will be dry and rough, feeling similar to velvet, and can also be itchy. Acanthosis nigricans usually develops slowly over time but spreading quickly has be linked to cancer. A dark patch (or band) of velvety skin on the back of your neck, armpit, groin, or elsewhere could mean that you have too much insulin in your blood - a sign of diabetes. While diabetes itself is not deadly, it has a number of serious complications from heart attacks to amputations, so it is vital to get an early diagnosis.7 Necrotising fasciitis BUT... in most cases a rash is harmless With skin rashes linked to so many serious diseases, including cancer, Dr Hussain reassured most of the time, a rash is harmless. \"The most common cause of a rash will NOT be cancer related.  I think that is a really important message to give to people,\" he said. \"The bottom line is if there is anything on your skin that you are worried about, you go and see your GP.\" tips@the-sun.co.uk  ", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18742992/spot-dangerous-rash-from-harmless-one/"},

As more  cases of the illness  are identified, new legislation will come into play tomorrow to help curb the spread. It means that  monkeypox  will be designated a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Other illnesses that also fall under this legislation include  Covid-19 , the  Plague , acute  meningitis ,  measles  and  smallpox . Labs must also inform the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) if a case is detected in samples. If monkeypox is suspected, medics must tell the correct authorities within three days or within 24 hours for urgent cases. Wendi Shepherd, Monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of Monkeypox.  \"This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. “It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.” Yesterday a further 73 cases of the infection were detected, bringing the total in the  UK to 301 .

Experts at the UKHSA said they will update Brits every three days on the growing spread. The current outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. Prof David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: \"Making monkeypox a notifiable disease suggests a desire to be sure to have reporting from all sectors (public and private) and all parts of the NHS. It suggests that the government wants to focus surveillance on the entire population - not only on the risk groups identified so far.  \"This will permit clear identification of all risk groups and help better understand the epidemiology and extent of spread.” Anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases have been seen in gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men. Despite this, experts say there is not one singular clear risk factor for picking up the virus. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said cases may be more prevalent among people in the gay community because they are more likely to come forward to sexual health clinics when they have  symptoms . The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks.

Only two cases have been in women. The UKHSA said today: “Anyone can get  monkeypox .  \"Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men, so it’s particularly important to be aware of the symptoms if you’re in these groups.” The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said cases may be more prevalent among people in the gay community because they are more likely to come forward to sexual health clinics when they have  symptoms . But in a report released on Wednesday night, the UKHSA stated that dating apps and bars used predominantly by gay people have linked cases. It said: “Investigations to date have identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad.  “Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified.” Researchers of a new study published on Thursday also noted “ links to sex  on premises venues, private sex parties, and the use of geospatial dating apps, both in the UK and abroad\". Published in  Eurosurveillance , the study investigated cases of monkeypox in the UK, grouping patients into three groups. One group was cases among those who had travelled from Africa, the second was household transmission, and the third was had no links to travel or previously confirmed cases. Of the 79 people in group three, all were men, and the majority (66) identified as gay, bisexual, or as men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, which just means that it’s consistently present, and accounts for some 9,000 cases a year. But it has been unusually spreading in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and other parts of the world. Experts now say there is evidence of community transmission in the UK. It may have been spreading in non-endemic cases “under the radar” for a while, the WHO has said. While health teams race to find more people with the virus through contact tracing, one expert has said it could be  hard to “stamp it out”. Professor John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the fact that so many infections have been “cropping up all over the world” indicated there was “going to be a problem”. “You’re not going to get rid of it overnight,” he told  The Independent. “It’s going to take a good couple of months of really solid work to chase up all the infections and contacts and stamp it out. It will take a while.” In most cases monkeypox is a mild disease and clears up on its own. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak. The signs may include - according to the UKHSA and previous medical reports: 2. Headache 3. Muscle aches 4. Backache 5. Chills 6. Exhaustion 7. Night sweats 8.

Most cases of  monkeypox  are in England (287), followed by Scotland (10), Wales (three) and Northern Ireland (two). The growing outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. Anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases have been seen in gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men.

Someone may also pick the virus up from touching the towels, clothes or bed linen of a patient. The virus has been detected in dozens of European nations, the US, Canada, Australia and other parts of the world. It may have been spreading in non-endemic cases “under the radar” for a while, the WHO has said. The UK has seen only six cases of monkeypox in the past.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed new findings into the virus today, after cases surged from May. So far, there have been  190 confirmed  cases of  monkeypox  identified from 6th to 31st May. A total of 183 were in England, four were in Scotland, two were in Northern Ireland and one was in Wales. Looking at England’s cases, the UKHSA revealed that 86 per cent were in one city. London has the most cases of country - and the UK - with 132 identified so far. The second “hotspot” is the South East, where 10 cases have been reported.  Health chiefs continue to see a trend in the groups that monkeypox is spreading within. Some 111 cases are known to be gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Only two cases have been in women.

{"title": "Parents rush to get chickenpox jabs as cases of monkeypox surge – how to tell them apart", "author": "Terri-Ann Williams", "date": "9:27, 31 May 2022", "text": "PARENTS have rushed to get their kids vaccinated against chickenpox due to fears surrounding an uptick in monkeypox infections. In the last six weeks the number of people who have had a jab for  chickenpox  has gone up by 146 per cent. Data from Well Pharmacy shows that this is double the number of doses usually rolled out. Experts say that this could be down to the confusion between the two viruses - which both produce a rash. The chickenpox jabs cost £130 and are not available for free on the NHS and will not protect you from monkeypox. Because the monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, people are given the smallpox jab to protect against the bug. In the UK, anyone who has been in contact with a monkeypox case is being given the smallpox jab. A  further 71 cases  of monkeypox were last night detected in the UK, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 179. The first case in Britain  was recorded on May 7,  but numbers have since jumped , with hundreds around the world. Just last month parents were warned of a  dangerous outbreak  of chickenpox and  scarlet fever infections  - with many families being on high alert. Experts say that many common infections declined during  lockdown  but they're now circulating at higher levels, particularly affecting pre-school and nurseries. Ifti Khan,  Well Pharmacy  superintendent said the current spate of monkyepox cases is concerning - especially as we are still living with the recent memory of  coronavirus   lockdowns .

One of the  differences between monkeypox and chickenpox  is that people with the latter will usually not experience swollen lymph nodes. A monkyepox rash will usually start of the face, before moving across the rest of the body. Mr Khan said that the best way to detect the two rashes is that with monkeypox, the rash will occur within one to three days after a fever. He explained: \"There are several stages to monkeypox. The first developing into papules and fluid filled pustules before forming a scab and falling off.  Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. \"Chickenpox usually forms in a different way.  \"In a chickenpox rash the spots do not develop uniformly and appear at different times.  \"However, monkeypox lesions appear and develop at the same time. \" As infections continue to rise, Brits have been urged to  take care  over the Jubilee weekend in order to stop cases of monkeypox spreading. The bug is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases are rising globally. Millions of people across the country will be taking part in celebrating  70 years of service  of our current monarch. Events  such as street parties, pub gatherings and barbeques are set to take place. But as more people gather, medics have warned of the potential spread. Consultant in Health Protection at UKHSA South West Dr Charlotte Bigland said: \"Monkeypox is circulating nationally and internationally, so it’s important to for people to stay vigilant. \"There has been a notable number of cases identified among people who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact 111 or their local sexual health service for advice.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

{"title": "I’m a doctor – here’s how to tell if your child’s rash is really monkeypox", "author": "Terri-Ann Williams", "date": "9:36, 25 May 2022", "text": "INFECTIONS of monkeypox are spreading globally and Brits have been warned to be on the lookout for rashes and lesions. A child in London is known to have contracted the illness, with many  parents now worrying  about marks their children are coming home with. Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Now one medic has revealed how you can tell if your child's rash is really monkeypox - or if it's down to something else entirely. Paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Dr David Porter said parents should not worry about their children having monkeypox as cases in youngsters are rare. So far in the UK  71 cases of the virus  have been detected, after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) last night revealed 14 more infections. One child in London is in intensive care, and  symptoms  are thought to be the same in youngsters as they are in adults. Dr Porter said  parents  should be reassured to follow what they would usually do if their child has a rash - unless a child has had known contacted with someone who has the illness. \"As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don’t think parents should be worried about this being… monkeypox at this stage, because we’re seeing a very low number of cases. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we’ve seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it’s been predominantly in adults anyway. “And without any contact history with somebody that’s known or strongly felt to have monkeypox, and then if you’ve got a rash at this time of year when we’ve seen lots of rashes from chickenpox and other things in children, hand, foot and mouth disease, then that’s what it’s likely to be,\" he explained. When it comes to the difference between rashes, it's the symptoms that sit alongside the illness that are different.  If your child has  chickenpox  rather than monkeypox, they will also suffer aches and pains, as well as a loss of appetite which is not a key symptom of monkeypox. The rashes are similar, but a  chickenpox rash  usually looks more inflamed, and is harder to spot on darker skin. Symptoms for  hand foot and mouth  are similar to chickenpox, but they vary from monkeypox in that usually, patients will have mouth ulcers which also appear on the tongue. AT RISK As a parent, medics say adults are more likely to get the illness than children. So if you get it and are looking after your little one, there is the likelihood - as with any illness that you could pass it on to them. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said the illness is \"relatively mild\" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\", Dr Hopkins said, and are like \"a viral illness\". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. \"It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,\" Dr Hopkins said. \"They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious.\" Medics  say the fatality rate in children is between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms.

A total of 71 more  infections  have been recorded, health officials say, bringing the total number to 179. The first case in Britain  was recorded on May 7,  but numbers have since jumped , with hundreds of cases around the world. Four of the UK's confirmed cases are in Scotland, two are in Northern Ireland, one is in Wales and the rest are in England.

That's because  the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact , meaning sex  could help spread it more easily. The World Health Organisation has warned that the current number of cases could just be the “peak of the iceberg”. WHO's pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: \"We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days.\" MONKEYPOX SPREADS However, the expert added it is \"not a disease the general public should be worried about\". \"It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.\" In recent weeks, the virus has been identified in several countries across Britain and the west, including Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. Symptoms include  fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Top Brit medic Dr Susan Hopkins said: \" We anticipated that further cases would be detected  through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals. We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days “We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. “Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. \"We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. “We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.\" The virus can be  significantly more harmful in young children.

{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak ‘likely sparked by sex at two raves in Spain and Belgium’, WHO warns", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "9:30, 24 May 2022", "text": "A WORLD health leader has said sex occuring at two raves in Europe could be behind the mystery monkeypox outbreaks.  Monkeypox  is not known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Health officials have said a notable proportion of the cases in Britain and Europe have been in young men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.  They have had no travel to  Africa , where the disease is endemic and typically spread through the handling of infected monkeys.  Professor David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO's emergencies department, said the leading theory “was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and  Belgium ”, AP reported. He said it is one hypothesis among many. 'Not a gay disease' Experts are stressing that monkeypox is not a \"gay disease\" just because patients presenting with symptoms are men who have sex with men (MSM). Dr Ranj Singh, and NHS doctor and TV personality, wrote in  Attitude magazine : \"It’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts has allowed more rapid spread.  \"We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all.  \"And we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’.\" Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence \"It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply.\" Andrew Lee, Professor of Public Health, University of Sheffield, said gay and bisexual men have suffered \"tremendously over the years\" due to the stigma with HIV.  He wrote in the  Conversation : \"We need to get across the message that monkeypox is not a disease of men who have sex with men.  \"It is not about sexuality: people tend to be infected through close physical contact and it does not have to be sexual in nature.\" He added that outbreaks could also occur among straight groups, including sports teams or simply a circle of friends.  European hotspots The two events DrHeymann was referring to were a Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria and  a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp,  Belgium .  Some men have gotten a diagnosis after they sought help for skin rashes at sexual health clinics. The WHO states: \"The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic.\" A rash  which looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters, and then scabbing, is the main  symptom of monkeypox .  It appears a couple of days after flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache and chills.  Dr Heymann said it’s known that monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, “and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission”. THE NHS only has enough space to treat 50 monkeypox patients, as cases continue to rise in the UK. Guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) states that all confirmed cases need to be transferred to high consequence infectious disease (HCID) units if they need hospital care. But just 15 beds are believed to have existed before Covid- with the spread of the virus ramping up capacity. Now sources say there are only 50 beds and many people will have to quarantine at home, the  MailOnline  reported. Experts said there is 'always a risk beds will run out', especially if the situation 'deteriorates further'. It's unclear whether the HCID units were kept following the pandemic, with many centres having being closed. Around 57 Brits have the illness, with more cases having been announced yesterday. Number 10 is 'keeping an eye' on the situation - but travel restrictions have been ruled out. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia said the number of beds available depends on how many cases would need that level of care. He said: \"The concern is that in the 2018 outbreak, the case infected a health worker and that was thought to be while they were changing the bedding because the flakes from their scabs were spread.  \"Patients have to be kept in the specialist unit to avoid the spread.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS has tried and tested plans in place for treating sporadic cases of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, through a network of highly specialised centres providing expert care. \"The NHS is working closely with UKHSA to ensure the small number of people identified are treated in line with their guidance.\" But he said there was unlikely to be widespread transmission of the virus, and the outbreak might be traceable to a single infection. It's very possible that somebody with the  monkeypox rash  on their hands or genitals spread it to someone else through physical touch. This helped seed the outbreak around the world, into the US and other European countries, Dr Heymann theorised.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), urged people - especially men who have sex with men - to be alert to symptoms. She said: “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms.   “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” There are now  56 cases  of monkeypox in England, and one in Scotland.  The UKHSA has said the threat to the public remains low. While the monkeypox is concerning experts, they have reassured it is “not another Covid”. He said it does not spread in the air - although can be passed from sneezing and coughing - and we have vaccines to protect against it. The UK is  stockpiling  jabs against the virus which will only be given to those who are deemed at high risk after being in contact with a case. The vaccine was designed to fight smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, before being discontinued.  But it is also 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, given they are similar viruses of the same family - although the former is more mild. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said Monday there were no plans for an \"at scale\" vaccination programme in the UK. It comes after  a British tourist  staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is tested for monkeypox. The holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura is one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed, health chiefs in the region said. Monkeypox is a viral infectious disease. This particular virus is a rare zoonosis, this means that it is transmitted to humans from an animal. It primarily occurs in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rain forests. In Africa, human infections have been documented through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels. It spreads between humans only through close contact. Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with the skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by the patient. Monkeypox has a mortality rate of between one and 10 per cent, with most deaths occurring in younger age groups. Initial symptoms include: A painful rash and open sores can then develop, usually starting on the face. Symptoms generally last from 14 to 21 days, with severe cases relating to age, the extent of virus exposure, the patient's health and the severity of complications.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/18666999/monkeypox-outbreak-likely-sparked-sex-raves-spain-belguim-who/"},

It was published just a few months before the current outbreak. In England, 101 people have the bug, with three cases having been detected in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The cases in Scotland are said to be in people with “recent travel history”, according to Public Health Scotland. Health officials added that close contacts of the affected people were being identified and provided with health information, advice and, where appropriate, a vaccine.

It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: \"We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  \"If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Everyone is welcome. “There are other potential routes of trying to get yourself into the system, maybe calling NHS 111, but this resource has been really overloaded with everyone calling who had a rash.” Another 16 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK, meaning there are 106 cases in total.  The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which means it can take three weeks for symptoms to appear. They include suffering from a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

Experts fear that if the virus is unleashed into wild animal populations then it will become endemic and be increasingly difficult to eradicate. All of the new patients are based in England, with the first case detected on May 6 and Wales and Northern Ireland declaring their first cases on Thursday.  The World Health Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. Monkeypox  is not known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex, possibly through contaminated items such as bed linen, clothing and towels. 'RESOURCES OVERLOADED' Officials are confident that the outbreak will not reach the levels of covid, believing that the risk to the public is low.  But they have urged Brits, especially gay and bisexual men, to be on the look out for any new rashes or lesions.   Teams from the UKHSA have been contacting high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising them to self-isolate at home for three weeks and avoid contact with children. Both confirmed cases and close contacts are being offered the Imvanex vaccine to form a buffer of immune people around a confirmed case to limit the spread of the disease. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  “If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.”", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18712484/brits-overloading-nhs-rash-health-chief-monkeypox/"},

Cases have now been  confirmed in the US , United Kingdom, Portugal, and Italy, while potential cases are being investigated in Canada and Spain. Nearly 20 years ago, Wisconsin had its own outbreak and the new cases hold painful memories for survivor Dr Kurt Zaeske. Back in 2003, he was a veterinarian who came in contact with the virus from a prairie dog he was treating. “Within about 48 hours of my handling that specimen, I became ill,” he told local news outlet  WISN . Zaeske developed lesions similar to chickenpox and suffered from nausea, dizziness, and a high fever. “I started developing a blister on my thumb that didn't look right, didn't act right,” he said back in 2003, after being quarantined for two weeks. Cases across the state sprouted up at the time, causing health officials to warn the public. Dr Seth Foldy was the Milwaukee Health Commissioner. “Direct contact with the skin lesion of monkeypox can transmit the virus,” he said in 2003. In the US, 71 cases of monkeypox were reported in 2003 and 39 of those cases were in Wisconsin.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one case of monkeypox has been confirmed in Massachusetts.  A possible case  was reported in Bellevue Hospital  in New York City. “We are investigating a possible case of monkeypox in NYC,” read a tweet from the  @nycHealthy  account. “Our Public Health Lab will conduct preliminary tests, which - if positive - will be sent to  @CDCgov  for confirmatory testing. “The Department’s epidemiologists will follow up with any individual who may have been in contact with the patient while infectious,” read  a statement  from the Department of Health and Hygiene in the state. MONKEYPOX SYMPTOMS There are two main strains of the virus: the Congo strain, which has a 10 percent mortality rate, and the West African strain, which only has a fatality rate of one percent. Spots often start on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, experts say. The disease is a viral infection, similar to smallpox but milder. The rash affects the face mostly (95 percent of cases) and hands (75 percent), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). During the illness, the rash changes from raised red bumps to spots filled with fluid.  The spots eventually erupt and form scabs, which later fall off. The infection causes two periods of illness. In the first phase, up to five days, patients can suffer: Do you have a story for The US Sun team? Email us at  exclusive@the-sun.com  or call  212 416 4552 .

It brings England’s total since early May to 70, with an additional  monkeypox  case reported in Scotland. As of May 23, no cases have so far been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. Despite further cases being detected, the risk to the UK population remains low, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, warned people to be aware of  \"rashes or lesions  on any part of their body\". She said this was particularly important if someone has a new sexual partner. \"They should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person,\" she said.  A rash is a key  symptom of the monkeypox  virus.  At first it looks similar to chickenpox, before developing into pus-filled blisters which eventually scab over. A person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off, and experts warn the bug can be caught from objects they touch, such as bedding, towels or utensils.

They are being advised to  isolate  themselves at home for up to 21 days. In addition, UKHSA has purchased supplies of a  smallpox vaccine  called Imvanex which is being offered to close contacts of someone diagnosed with monkeypox. Although the vaccine is against smallpox - a virus declared eradicated in 1980 - it is shown to be 85 per cent effective against the similar monkeypox virus. But most Brits won’t have had it, given it was discontinued upon the eradication of smallpox.  Worldwide spread Health authorities in Europe, North America, Israel and Australia have identified more than 100 cases of monkeypox in recent days. The outbreak is unusual because it is affecting countries where monkeypox is not endemic. It is only endemic in parts of Africa, where there are some 9,000 cases per year, and humans are typically infected by animals.  Health officials are still investigating, but a top adviser to the WHO said this week that the leading theory is that monkeypox was likely spread after sexual activity at  two recent raves in Europe . Most cases have been in men who have sex with men, including those who are gay and bisexual. However, experts have stressed the importance of avoiding a \"gay disease\" label, which could lead to stigma, and therefore further spread.  It may just be unlucky that monkeypox happened to get into this one particular community first, said Dr Jake Dunning, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Oxford. It's just that they are a community and by having sex with each other, that is how it's spreading, he said. While  monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. About six per cent of cases are fatal, the WHO.

So far, there have been  190 confirmed  cases of  monkeypox  identified from 6th to 31st May in the UK. A total of 183 were in England, four were in Scotland, two were in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Looking at England’s cases, the UK Health Security Agency revealed that  86 per cent were in London  - with 132 infections in the capital. As the spread continues globally, scientists have said the recent outbreaks are an 'accumulation of years of warnings that basically went ignored'. Monkeypox is usually found in Western African, and due to that, medics say other countries don't often pay attention. Scientist and infectious diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Dr Boghuma Titanji said researchers have long been concerned that it could fill the gap left by smallpox. \"If given the opportunity to spread unchecked ... it could get better at infecting humans and lead to bigger outbreaks than what we've seen in the past,\" she told  CBC News . The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that some 550 cases have been reported in the latest spike in infections across 30 countries where the virus is not commonly found.

Speaking at a press conference on monkeypox,  Covid-19  and other global health issues he said: \"Investigations are ongoing, but the sudden appearance of monkeypox in many countries at the same time suggests there may have been undetected transmission for some time. “WHO is urging affected countries to widen their surveillance, to look for cases in the broader community. “Anyone can be infected with monkeypox if they have close physical contact with someone else who is infected. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: “It’s important to remember that generally, monkeypox symptoms resolve on their own, but it can be severe in some cases.” Dr Rosamund Lewis added that right now, monkeypox is in the 'outbreak' stage and could be stopped. She said that there is cause for concern, as it's not yet clear how long the virus has been in circulation for. “So we don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain, what WHO and all member states are certainly trying to do is to prevent onward spread.” Due to the spread, Brits have been urged to look out for any new lesions or blisters that may appear.

The virus  is not new, having been endemic in parts of Africa for decades.  However, people in countries where the virus has recently appeared may not be familiar with  monkeypox  symptoms. There have been very few cases in the UK historically, with the  first only in 2018 . But in May alone, some  78 infections  have now been detected. Researchers published a paper this week that detailed the cases of seven people  previously infected  with monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021. They had all been watched closely in hospital, where they stayed for between ten and 39 days. Patients reported early symptoms of fever, night sweats, cold-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes and groin.  They then developed the  rash characteristic of monkeypox  one to four days later.  But some patients had no early signs, and developed a rash straight away, the paper published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases revealed.

Arms, legs and hands were also common.  Five of the seven developed the rash around their genitalia. These reports, together with the list of symptoms compiled by the UKHSA, helps build a picture of how monkeypox presents. The signs may include: 1.Fever 2. Headache 3. Muscle aches 4. Backache 5. Chills 6. Exhaustion 7. Night sweats 8. Cold-like symptoms, such as congestion and runny nose 9. Swollen lymph nodes 10. Swollen groin 11. Rash Complications of the illness were documented as: 12. Low mood 13. Severe pain 14. Conjunctivitis The rash and its blisters appeared on locations: ‘I thought I’d lose my thumb’ Meanwhile, a veterinarian who caught monkeypox in 2003 has come forward to describe his illness. Dr Kurt Zaeske told  NBC  he suffered “flu-like symptoms” including a fever, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and a headache. Then he started developing small lesions on his body, including \"one significant blister that developed on my thumb, and that became quite painful.\" He said: \"My biggest fear was that I was going to lose my thumb and not be able to practice anymore.” Dr Zaeske caught monkeypox from a dog who had likely been infected by a rodent. He was part of the biggest and first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa, when more than 70 cases were identified in the US, all linked to infected dogs. But the current outbreak is set to challenge that. The number of confirmed cases of monkeypox worldwide has reached 219 outside of countries where it is endemic, according to the European Union's disease agency. More than a dozen countries where monkeypox is unusual, mostly in Europe, have reported at least one confirmed case, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said on Wednesday. It added that most of the cases were detected in young men, self-identifying as men who have sex with men. The UKHSA has said many patients had been diagnosed after going to a sexual health clinic with a rash. But it has warned that people who have had multiple sexual partners - regardless of sexual orientation - are more at risk.

Last night medical chiefs confirmed a further  36 infections  had been recorded in England. It brings the total to 56, with one case also being reported in Scotland yesterday. The  monkeypox  outbreak, now spanning some 20 countries, is mystifying health leaders. It is endemic in West and Central Africa, but extremely  rare elsewhere . However, between 100 and 200 confirmed and suspected cases have been detected in recent weeks across the world. The key signs to look out for include a fever and headache, but officials have warned that some groups are more at risk than others when it comes to catching the illness. The  World Health Organisation  (WHO) says that anyone who has close physical contact with someone who has symptoms of monkeypox, or with an infected animal are at highest risk of infection.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Medics explained that newborns are at risk - just as they are with other illnesses, due to the fact that their immune systems have not yet been fully formed - meaning they are more susceptible to infection. They added: \"Newborns, children and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.  \"Health workers are also at higher risk due to longer virus exposure.\" Those who are vaccinated against smallpox are likely to have some protection against the monkeypox infection. Currently people who have been in contact with those infected are being given the vaccine as a precaution. Experts at the WHO said: \"Younger people are unlikely to have been vaccinated against smallpox because smallpox vaccination stopped worldwide after smallpox became the first human disease to be eradicated in 1980.  Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. \"Even though people who have been vaccinated against smallpox will have some protection against monkeypox, they also need to take precautions to protect themselves and others.\" Health officials have said a notable proportion of cases in the UK and Europe have been in young men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on May 20 said a number of early cases had been detected in gay and bisexual men. Because of this, the agency said it is urging this community to be particularly alert. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: \"Clinicians should be alert to any individual presenting with unusual rashes without a clear alternative diagnosis and should contact specialist services for advice.\" 'RAPID SPREAD' However, monkeypox is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But it can be spread through sexual contact when someone touches the lesions of an infected person. It can be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. Coughs and sneezes are also a mode of transmission. NHS doctor and TV star, Dr Ranj Singh said the global spread is worrying, as there doesn't seem to be a clear connection between travel - suggesting that it is spreading through humans. Dr Ranj stressed that the high proportion of cases in men who have sex with men does not mean it is a \"gay disease\". He  told Attitude magazine: \"It’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts has allowed more rapid spread. \"We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all. \"And we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’. \"It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply.  \"So this community should definitely be on increased alert,\" he told  Attitude . The WHO added: \"The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

A total of 57 cases have been confirmed in Britain so far, with all but one of them in England.   The rare virus has also spread across 20 countries in Europe, with  Brits already warned to be \"alert\" when they hit holiday hotspots  this year. There have still not been any reports of monkeypox in pets, but in a rapid risk assessment on Monday, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said it was important to “manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife”. Issuing the update, the ECDC said: “If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. “Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. “Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low.” Prof David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, told  the Telegraph  this was a “valid concern”. He said: “It would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with.\" Experts believe rodents, such as rats and squirrels, can harbour the virus but the full range of animals at risk is not yet known.

Health chiefs have warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, however can be passed on through  skin-to-skin contact during sex . It causes flu-like symptoms before a  blistering rash  spreads across the body. Festivals  - attended by Europeans on holiday - have been tied to outbreaks across the region, including in Spain, Italy and Germany.  And the World Health Organization (WHO) said the explosion of cases is “a highly unusual event”. The agency’s Europe director, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could fuel the spread of  monkeypox . Dr Kluge  said : \"I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the  symptoms  are unfamiliar to many.\" Asked about the risk to Brits going to summer festivals or going on holiday, chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said people “need to be alert” to the virus. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"No, no considerations of that kind.  \"What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel.\" Before now, there had only been eight cases of  monkeypox in the UK , all with links to travel from West Africa. But that's not the case for this outbreak, which has now seen at least  57 in the UK  infected. There is already community transmission in the UK - but the UKHSA stresses that the risk to the public is \"low\". Many more are expected to be diagnosed in the coming weeks, experts say. Dr Hopkins comments came as some of Europe’s top holiday destinations reported outbreaks of the virus. There are around 100 cases across Europe and Northern America, the WHO said Monday. The full list of European countries with  monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have  cases And elsewhere in the world: A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox \"mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans. VAX DASH It comes as the EU’s infectious-disease agency prepares to tell member states to prepare vaccination programmes, according to the  Financial Times. Any jab initiatives would use an existing smallpox vaccine that also offers 85 per cent efficacy against monkeypox.  The two virsues cause similar symptoms, although smallpox was eradicated by 1980 thanks to the jabs.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said there were no plans for an \"at scale\" vaccination programme in the UK. It came despite Health Secretary Sajid Javid ordering a further  20,000 doses  of the smallpox jab on top of the 5,000 already secured.  \"We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers,\" the PM's spokesperson said. \"But given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign.\" The outbreaks are atypical, according to the WHO, as they are occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate.  Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. But as of yet, the WHO does not have evidence the virus has mutated. WHO said confirmed cases have so far been the less severe West African group of monkeypox viruses.  MP Simon Clarke, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said this was not \"some repeat of Covid\". He said: \"We are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.\"", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18665184/monkeypox-warning-permanent-europe-pets/"},
{"title": "Holiday warning after monkeypox fears hit favourite UK summer break destination as Brit tourist tested", "author": null, "date": "8:22, 24 May 2022", "text": "A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The outbreaks have been traced to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Gran Canaria pride festival attended by 80,000 people from Britain and other European countries. News of the suspected Fuerteventura case follows warnings by chief medical advisor Dr Susan Hopkins for people to be “alert to the virus” on holiday. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population remains extremely low.

On Monday  Britain’s monkeypox outbreak nearly tripled in size  as health officials confirmed another 37 patients have caught the tropical virus. UKHSA bosses have now logged 57 cases in little over a fortnight. Authorities described the outbreak - which has disproportionately struck gay and bisexual men - as \"significant and concerning\" but insisted the risk to the UK population remains low. It comes as experts have warned  monkeypox could become permanent in Europe  if pets start catching it too. There have still not been any reports of monkeypox in pets, but in a rapid risk assessment on Monday, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said it was important to “manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife”. Issuing the update, the ECDC said: “If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. “Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. “Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk? Email us at  exclusive@the-sun.co.uk  or call  0207 782 4104 . You can WhatsApp us on 07423 720 250.

The risk to the population remains low, but health officials have urged Brits to be alert to  rashes and new lesions  on any part of the body. In England, 85 people have the infection, with three cases having been confirmed in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The cases in Scotland are said to be in people with “recent travel history”, according to Public Health Scotland. Health officials added that close contacts of the affected people were being identified and provided with health information, advice and, where appropriate, a vaccine. Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body.

At present, anyone who has been in contact with someone who has caught the infection will be given a dose. Anyone who has the bug has to isolate and Brits have been told to be aware of the key signs when it comes to infection. Medics have said the advice applies to everyone, but added that the majority of cases have been detected in gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men. Experts are therefore asking people in these groups to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

{"title": "Is monkeypox deadly?", "author": "Danni Scott", "date": "11:44, 24 May 2022", "text": "A SMALL outbreak of monkeypox has caused concern in Europe and the USA but many people are unaware of the virus.  Monkeypox  is more often seen in Africa than in Western countries but is  not unheard of in the UK .  Is monkeypox deadly?  Monkeypox  comes from the same family of viruses as  smallpox  but is much less severe. No deaths have been reported  from the 2022 outbreak of the disease in the UK.  The chance of catching monkeypox in the UK is very low as  cases are rare.  Cases have been linked to some  festivals in Europe .  According to the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) up to a tenth of people who contract the virus may die but this is mainly in younger age groups.  The majority of those who catch monkeypox will survive.  How dangerous is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual.  I thought I had Covid & feared I'd die in agony in hospital - it was  monkeypox Monkeypox cases hit 9,492 in US with Biden declaring virus health emergency I was interrogated, humiliated and 'thrown off' a flight over my ECZEMA Urgent monkeypox warning amid fears virus will become endemic in the UK Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox.  It is possible to become infected by touching the clothes or bed sheets which have been used by someone with Monkeypox.  This means that the danger of contracting the disease is low, with around 20 cases confirmed in the UK currently.  If you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. What is the public health advice?  The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus.  If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is a rare infection that comes from wild animals such as rodents and primates.  It was first discovered in 1958 when two colonies of monkeys broke out in pox-like symptoms, hence the name.  The first case of a human infected with the virus was in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is not exclusive to any particular members of the population and is  not an STI .  What are the symptoms? The most prominent  symptom of monkeypox  is the rash which forms in the second stage of the illness.  Initial symptoms are:  These can appear between five to 21 days after infection.  The rash starts one to five days after the other symptoms begin, it can be confused with chicken pox in the early stages. Spots turn into small fluid-filled blisters, which scab over and then fall off. Most people suffer from monkeypox for about two weeks.

Protections teams have said that anyone who has been risk assessed and remains well, should isolate at home for 21 days. In order to protect the community, the UKHSA has stockpiled smallpox vaccines. At present those who have been in contact with identified cases are being given the jab. Health authorities in Europe, North America, Israel and Australia have identified more than 100 cases of monkeypox in recent days. The outbreak is unusual because it is affecting countries where monkeypox is not endemic. It is only endemic in parts of Africa, where there are some 9,000 cases per year, and humans are typically infected by animals. The NHS says the first signs of the illness are: Medics said that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. Health officials are still investigating, but a top adviser to the WHO said this week that the leading theory is that monkeypox was likely spread after sexual activity at  two recent raves in Europe . Most cases have been in men who have sex with men, including those who are gay and bisexual. However, experts have stressed the importance of avoiding a \"gay disease\" label, which could lead to stigma, and therefore further spread. It may just be unlucky that monkeypox happened to get into this one particular community first, said Dr Jake Dunning, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Oxford. It's just that they are a community and by having sex with each other, that is how it's spreading, he said. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

{"title": "Ignore the hoohah, monkeypox virus isn’t the new Covid", "author": "Rod Liddle", "date": "21:20, 25 May 2022", "text": "YIKES! Monkeypox! WTF is all that about? Horrible blisters all over your face. A disease from Africa which has decided to come over here for a bit. Transmissible from animal  to human and vice versa. Don’t s**g any monkeys, then. And if you must, then wear protection. There are currently 78 cases of this illness in the UK. It had been largely confined to people in Africa. It is now  spreading across Europe , mostly among the gay population — though it looks like the NHS and World Health Organisation are playing down the gay side of it. It has also been reported that we should  avoid eating meat , or only eat meat that has been “thoroughly cooked”. What? You can catch it from a medium-rare ribeye steak? How? No, you can’t. I have the feeling that we’re being wound up by folks who seem to be yearning for another pandemic. And another  lockdown . Already, our  beleaguered Prime Minister  has refused to rule out a lockdown. And health protection teams say that anyone who has been risk-assessed for monkey-pox and remains well should  isolate at home for THREE WEEKS . So what’s going on? First things first. No, you can’t catch it from a medium-rare ribeye steak. Or even a very rare ribeye steak. Or a Chicken Zinger or a pork kebab. What wasn’t in the headlines was the KIND of meat you shouldn’t eat. Turns out the riskiest stuff is monkey, squirrel and rat. Bush meat. So try to avoid chowing down on rat biriyani, sauteed squirrel in the basket or chateaubriand de singe (that’s chateau-briand of monkey, you plebs). And if you can’t, then ask the restaurant to make sure it’s well cooked. Transmissible from animal to human and vice versa. Don’t shag any monkeys, then. And if you must, then wear protection. Is it like  Covid , then, and really easy to catch? Nope, it isn’t. Getting jiggy with an infected person may do it, sure. Any exchange of bodily fluids is a risk. But otherwise you are in very little danger. It is MUCH harder to catch than Covid. Does it kill you? Nah. Almost certainly not. There’s a death rate of between one and three per cent, which is quite high, sure. But that’s largely because of the poor health systems in the countries of West Africa, where it is prevalent. Otherwise, it will be a bit uncomfortable for a couple of weeks, maybe three. And you’ll have those blisters, a bit like chicken pox. Then it will go. But what if the virus mutates, like Covid did? And gets more contagious and more lethal? Nope, it almost certainly won’t. Almost all the evidence says monkeypox is a very stable virus, not given to mutating. It tends to behave itself. UNLIKELY TO BE FATAL So all in all, it’s not really very much to write home about, is it? Hard to catch, still very rare and unlikely to be fatal. And yet we’re being whipped up into a bit of frenzy about it. Don’t worry. People have the heebee-jeebees as a consequence of Covid. And now every virus that arrives here is a cause for great wailing and gnashing of teeth. And there will always be those clamouring for another lockdown. Probably because they liked the previous ones so much. So, for the rest of us — carry on, as you were. Nothing much to see here. Unless, tonight, you were planning to elope with an attractive gibbon who has been feeling under the weather recently. THANKS a lot, then, to the greedy members of transport union the RMT for  threatening to bring chaos to the country  on June 6. No trains running anywhere. They’re very proud of this, the union. The country faces rampant inflation and these selfish clowns are determined to make it worse. The average basic pay for a train driver in the UK is £54,000. That’s a lot more than an average teacher’s salary. The Government must not give in to them. BETWEEN FROCK AND A HARD PLACE OVER STATUE DIFFICULT one for the deranged wokies, this. They’ve just unveiled a statue in Halifax to the 19th-century “Gentleman Jack” —  Anne Lister , known as “the first modern lesbian”. Not sure why someone’s sexual preferences warrant a statue. I quite fancy women dressed as pirates but nobody ever suggested knocking up a statue to me. Anyway, the actress Suranne Jones — who plays Lister in  the BBC drama  — attended the opening. But now it has become clear Lister benefited from the slave trade. Oooh, what to do? I suggest that as soon as the statue is unveiled, they cheer for a bit then throw it in the River Calder. I SEE  football violence  is back with a vengeance. Port Vale fans physically attacking Swindon Town players. An Everton fan taunting Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira (and getting a good kicking in return). Northampton fans going doolally on the pitch. A Nottingham Forest fan assaulting a Sheffield United player. My first thought was that if any of this had involved fans from my team, Millwall, there would be statements in Parliament and the ground would be closed. And second, are the authorities really going to proceed with their plans to reintroduce standing at games? KILLER DOGS A CURSE HERE’S another  terminally deluded dog owner  — Chanel Fong, of Wrexham. This is what she said about her American Bully-type hound: “So many people said what a passive dog Cookie was, but Cookie hasn’t attacked Kev, it wasn’t a vicious attack — it was a tragic accident.” What actually happened is that passive, gentle Cookie tried to eat her partner’s dad. And in doing so, killed him. And here’s the thing. Every time I suggest that people who have powerful dogs need their heads examining, a whole bunch of similarly deluded owners will pile in saying what wonderful pets they are. And more and more people will be killed. Meanwhile, a man quoted on Reddit thinks he’s pulled an hilarious prank by calling his dog Askim. So when people enquire as to what his name is, the owner says, “Yep, side splitting, innit?” It’s apparently annoyed people in the park where he walks the pooch. Wherever it is, they seem a miserable bunch. My own dog is called Jessie. But she also is referred to as Lionel Jessie or Didier Dogba (just like Jeremy Clarkson’s hound). Also as Slobberdog Milosevic, after the former Serbian leader, and Otto Scamperer, after a musical conductor. Occasionally, my wife will refer to her as Princess Pickle Paws and I sometimes call her Doggrich Dogg of Doggville. Truth is, dogs don’t give a monkey’s what names they’re called, do they? BORIS SAVED BY WAR GORDON Bennett. They even had a karaoke party while the rest of us were in lockdown! According to the famous  Sue Gray’s  report, there were SIXTEEN separate parties. Or get-togethers. Or p***-ups, call them what you will. One bash went on until four in the morning. At another, someone puked up and two people had a fight. Civil servants, I assume. “Say that again and I’ll shove a bottle of hand sanitiser up your a***, Oliver.” “Yeah, you and whose army, Tarquin, you ponce? I’ll open you up like a can of peaches. ’Ave it, you muppet.” It is infuriating to know that, from Boris Johnson down, they believed the rules they enforced on US were not intended to apply to them. “Do as I say, not as I do. Lock-down is for plebs.” If we ever have another lockdown, will anyone take it seriously? Knowing that THEY won’t? And the Prime Minister is lying through his teeth about it all. There’s no doubt in my mind that if all this had come out BEFORE Putin invaded the Ukraine, Johnson would be dead meat by now. He may still be dead meat with the electorate. But the war has focused the minds of the Tories and I suspect that, rightly or wrongly, Johnson will not be shifted now. WOKE’S A JOKE A BRILLIANT evening of entertainment from  Ricky Gervais’s  new show, Super Nature. The highlight was an unrepeatable section where Ricky, having transitioned to being a woman, pulls a lesbian. Of course, the wokies are going bananas. One said that Ricky, through his jokes, was “literally killing people”. Deranged, no? Two points. As Gervais says, jokes are fiction. They are not the same thing as reality. They are just jokes. And second, any concept, idea or belief that cannot stand a bit of ribbing is almost certainly based upon a misconception. Gervais, meanwhile, goes from strength to strength.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18687532/monkeypox-lockdown-no-reason-worry/"},
{"title": "I’m a GP – monkeypox is not a ‘gay disease’ and we must not let misinformation spread", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "16:22, 24 May 2022", "text": "THE MONKEYPOX outbreak is infecting people in Europe and the Americas in a way not seen before. Health officials say that the disease has so far appeared to disproportionately affect  gay and bisexual  men - otherwise known as “men who have sex with men” (MSM).  But a GP has cautioned against seeing monkeypox in a similar light to HIV, which could have harmful consequences.  Dr Ranj Singh, an NHS doctor and TV personality, said “we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of  HIV  being a ‘gay disease’”. Andrew Lee, a professor of Public Health at the University of Sheffield, agreed that “stigma won’t help” - as we “know too well from our experience with HIV”. There have been under 200 cases of monkeypox detected globally by the World Health Organization (WHO) in places considered unusual.  While  monkeypox  has been causing outbreaks in Africa for years - meaning it is endemic there - it is extremely rare outside of the region. Now, countries including the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Spain and many more countries in Europe are reporting cases every day. UK health officials report that gay and bisexual men should be more alert to the symptoms of the virus, given that it is occuring more in their demographic. But that does not mean “this disease only affects men who have sex with men”. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence There are a number of reasons why this group of people may be at the forefront of the outbreak. For example, the World Health Organization says it may be because they are more likely to seek medical attention for symptoms. The agency states: “The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic.” Dr Sigh said it’s possible that the “networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts” has allowed the virus to spread easier among this group of people. However, he added: “We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all.\" In an article for gay magazine  Attitude , he said: “It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply.” He added that “this community should definitely be on increased alert”.  Meanwhile, Prof Lee said “we need to get across the message that monkeypox is not a disease of men who have sex with men”. He wrote in  The Conversation : “It is not about sexuality: people tend to be infected through close physical contact and it does not have to be sexual in nature.” Physical touch, or handling objects that an infected person has, such as bedding or clothes, can lead to infection.  Prof Lee said: \"It could just as easily have been an outbreak in a heterosexual friendship network, or a group of sports people, or occupational group, or other social groups.” Prof Lee explained the dangers of labelling monkeypox as a “gay disease”. Firstly, people may fail to realise they are at risk of catching it, if they are straight.  Secondly, it risks creating a stigma, which in turn could lead to more spread. Prof Lee said: “There are lessons we need to learn from the  HIV/Aids pandemic .  “Some of the stigma was driven by deeply held religious and cultural beliefs in society that unfairly equated their sexuality with notions of immorality and negative stereotypes of promiscuity.  “Gay and bisexual men were blamed as the source and cause of HIV spread, even though it was also spread through other routes... “This, in turn, had serious  consequences for the people affected , especially on their mental and emotional wellbeing.” Dr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, an infectious disease physician and virologist at Emory University in Atlanta, drew on parallels with HIV to show the risks of stigmatising monkeypox. She wrote in  PLOS Blogs : \"Cases [of HIV] were under-reported in the early days of the epidemic as individuals who contracted the virus went underground instead of seeking medical care.  \"This resulted in many missed opportunities to quickly learn about the infection, understand its transmission and importantly, provide targeted public health interventions to curb its spread.  \"Instead, individuals in the group most affected at the time were blamed for their own suffering and ostracized as purveyors of disease.\"", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18672586/monkeypox-not-gay-disease-misinformation/"},
{"title": "Severe monkeypox patients could be infectious WEEKS after recovery, scientists discover", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "9:36, 25 May 2022", "text": "SEVERE monkeypox patients may be infectious for up to ten weeks, scientists fear. An investigation of previous patients who had  the disease  found one man tested positive more than 70 days after he first showed symptoms. It comes as cases of the virus  reach 71 in the UK , and health officials have urged people to stay alert to symptoms. Signs of the disease  in the early stages include fever, headache, chills, back and muscle aches. A rash  may develop between one and five days later, which at first looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters that scab over. People can catch the virus from others by touching their scabs or lesions, having close physical contact, touching contaminated objects or being exposed to respiratory droplets. Patients are contagious until their scabs fall off, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) says, and the scabs themselves can contain viral material. However, the latest study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggests people may be infectious long after their rash has settled. Researchers looked at seven cases of monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021. One of the patients, an unnamed man in his 40s, caught monkeypox in Nigeria before being hospitalised in the UK.

But six weeks later, when he had sex for the first time since his bout of illness, the tell-tale monkeypox rash returned. The man also had swollen lymph nodes, which are a sign of infection. At hospital, a test that swabs the throat revealed the man was positive for monkeypox.  The findings suggest that the man was infectious, given that he had the rash again. Study author Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved.  “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.” It is not clear if the man would have been contagious in the six-week period between hospital discharge, and his “relapse” after having sex. Dr Adler said researchers were “surprised” that monkeypox could be detected in the throat and blood for that length of time, MailOnline reported. A relapse such as this has not been reported before, the paper authors wrote. But they noted they were “unaware of any reports of monkeypox virus detection in seminal fluid”. Other people in the study were positive on respiratory PCR tests for between seven and 17 days. All made a full recovery and none suffered severe complications. The World Health Organization says symptoms of monkeypox usually start from six to 13 days after infection, but can range from five to 40 days. A person is not contagious during this so-called incubation period. They are able to spread the virus once they are showing symptoms, including the rash. Health officials have so far said that patients with monkeypox in the current outbreak have typically had a mild illness.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18679138/severe-monkeypox-patients-infectious-10-weeks/"},

It comes as  the virus  spreads across Europe and a top British medic warns holidaymakers to \"be alert\" - as children are more likely to become seriously ill. Hours after Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said infections here will rise,  Belgium  announced there will be a mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone suffering from the disease. The country currently has three cases, all of which were recorded on Friday and are linked to the four-day Darklands Festival in port city Antwerp.

In an interview on the BBC this morning, Dr Hopkins said: \"We do know from reports from Africa, where the disease has circulated in outbreaks over many years, certain individuals are much more at risk of severe disease, including immuno-suppressed individuals or young children. \"In adults, it is relatively mild.\" But she said medics are learning more every day, adding: \"Clearly, this is a  new infectious disease  that we haven't seen in our community before. \"We will need to learn a lot about it over the coming weeks.\" Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence As of Friday, there were 20 cases in the UK.

Countries including Spain, Portugal and central Africa are among those reporting outbreaks. On Friday, health chiefs in Spain reported 23 more confirmed cases. Most are linked to a sauna in Madrid. Cases in Spain and Italy have also been  traced to an island festival  attended by 80,000 revellers. \"The risk to the general population remains extremely low,\" she said - but added: \"People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.\" Initial symptoms include a  viral illness , before a chicken pox-type rash spreads across parts of the body. Anyone who feels ill must \"stay at home\", Dr Hopkins said. \"If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic,\" she said. HOLS WARNING It's believed Covid lockdowns across the world may have fuelled the spread of the virus. \"We know there's been period of restrictions across Europe, and we don't know where infection has come from,\" she said. \"There is no obvious connection to a single event in our cases in the UK.\" However, medics believe some people are contracting the virus after a sexual encounter as the virus can spread more easily through personal contact. Dr Hopkins says it seems to be particularly prevalent in gay and bi men. Anyone changing sexual partners regularly or having close contact with people they don't know should come forward if they develop a rash, she said. Yesterday, Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, says  the medical community is bracing for more as the virus spreads. We are detecting more cases on a daily basis She told Sky News: \"What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. \"It's already circulating in the general population. \"It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks.\" Meanwhile, it has emerged experts warned three years ago that monkeypox would \"fill the void\" left by smallpox. Scientists from leading institutions including the University of Cambridge and the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the disease would evolve to fill the \"niche\" left after smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is usually mild, it can prove fatal in rare cases. The strain causing the current outbreak kills an average of one in 100 infected.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the experts attended a seminar in London back in 2019 and discussed how there was a need to develop \"a new generation vaccines and treatments\". Their discussion was published in the Vaccine journal in 2020. Monkeypox , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact -  including sex . People infected with monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection The NHS says the first symptoms are: They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18648283/monkeypox-travel-warning-holiday-illness/"},

The  disease  has suddenly started spreading in 20 unlikely places across the world, including Europe. Festivals  - attended by Europeans on holiday - have been tied to outbreaks across the region, including in Spain, Italy and Germany.  The World Health Organization (WHO) said the explosion of cases is “a highly unusual event”. The agency’s Europe director, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could fuel the spread of  monkeypox . Dr Kluge  said : \"I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the  symptoms  are unfamiliar to many.\" Asked about the risk to Brits going to summer festivals or going on holiday, chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said people “need to be alert” to the virus. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans.

But that's not the case for this outbreak, which has now seen at least  57 in the UK  infected. There is already community transmission in the UK - but the UKHSA stresses that the risk to the public is \"low\". Many more are expected to be diagnosed in the coming weeks, experts say. The disease appears to be disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men.  Health chiefs have warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, however can be passed on through  skin-to-skin contact during sex . It causes flu-like symptoms before a  blistering rash  spreads across the body. Dr Hopkins comments came as some of Europe’s top holiday destinations reported outbreaks of the virus. There are around 100 cases across Europe and Northern America, the WHO said Monday. The full list of European countries with  monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have  cases And elsewhere in the world: A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox \"mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans. VAX DASH It comes as the EU’s infectious-disease agency prepares to tell member states to prepare vaccination programmes, according to the  Financial Times. Any jab initiatives would use an existing smallpox vaccine that also offers 85 per cent efficacy against monkeypox.  The two virsues cause similar symptoms, although smallpox was eradicated by 1980 thanks to the jabs.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said there were no plans for an \"at scale\" vaccination programme in the UK. It came despite Health Secretary Sajid Javid ordering a further  20,000 doses  of the smallpox jab on top of the 5,000 already secured.  \"We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers,\" the PM's spokesperson said. \"But given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign.\" The outbreaks are atypical, according to the WHO, as they are occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate.  Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. But as of yet, the WHO does not have evidence the virus has mutated. WHO said confirmed cases have so far been the less severe West African group of monkeypox viruses.  MP Simon Clarke, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said this was not \"some repeat of Covid\". He said: \"We are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.\"", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18661189/monkeypox-holiday-warning-spreads-popular-tourist-spots/"},

People are being urged to be vigilant to the signs of the bug, which is spreading at an unusual rate globally.  There are  20 cases  of  monkeypox  in  the UK , a number that is growing “daily”, according to the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA). Just under 100 cases in 12 countries have been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) between May 13 and 21.  What’s  unusual about these outbreaks  is that they are occurring in places where monkeypox is not endemic. Only eight cases have been reported in the UK over history, but now it is facing a predicted  \"significant rise\"  in cases.  The disease usually crops up in the topical and rural rainforests of Central and West Africa. Monkeypox causes symptoms between five and 21 days after exposure. It starts with flu-like  symptoms , including a  fever , headache, muscle and back ache and chills. An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

UKHSA says: “Within one to five days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body.” This early phase of the  rash, which they have not provided a photo of, looks like chickenpox, the agency says.  The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. By the third day, lesions have progressed from flat (macular) to raised (papular). And within a couple of days, the lesions become small blisters filled with clear fluid, called vesicles. Vesicles are pictured in the first image of the chart (A). Image B shows how the lesions become round, raised and firm to the touch. These are called pustules, and they contain yellow-coloured pus.  Lesions will develop a depression in the centre (umbilication), pictured in image C. Then, the pustules will remain for approximately five to seven days before beginning to crust (pictured D-F). The UKHSA says: “An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.” Monkeypox lesions can very in size and don’t necessarily develop along the same timeline. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. “In severe cases, lesions can coalesce until large sections of skin slough off,” it says. ", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18657401/monkeypox-chart-earliest-signs-symptoms-watch-for/"},
{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak is ‘unprecedented’ – the five signs you must not ignore, Dr Hilary warns", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "10:10, 23 May 2022", "text": "DR HILARY Jones has warned the outbreak of monkeypox is “unprecedented”, as he told Brits to be vigilant of the symptoms. The UK has 20 cases so far, a number that will be updated on Monday by the UK Health and Security Agency, which says infections are being found “daily”.  Monekypox  primarily occurs in west Africa, but transmission is occurring across Europe, the  US , Canada, Israel, and Australia. The World Health Organization has confirmed 92 cases in 12 countries, with a suspected 28 others.  Good Morning Britain’s Dr Hilary  said 20 cases among a population of 65 million in the UK “doesn’t sound a lot”. “However, it does appear to be an unprecedented outbreak in 11 countries around the world,” he added. “It suggests that it has become a bit more transmissible. “We know it is not a serious infection, usually. Mortality is about one per cent with the less virulent west African variant, if you want to call it a variant. “We need to be vigilant. People need to know  the symptoms  of flu-like symptoms and  a rash .\" Dr Hilary  warned to look out for: Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence The  monkeypox  rash appears one to three days after the flu-like symptoms kick in. It often starts on the face before spreading to others parts of the body, including the genital area. The illness typically lasts between  two and four weeks . Dr Hilary said people should self-isolate if they have been in contact with someone who has monkeypox, as they are a high-risk person and could spread it themselves. He said: “Self isolation means not travelling, it means giving details so that contact tracing can occur. “And we are adding supplies of smallpox vaccines to protect people who are at high risk, people who work in health services for example.  “So for most people, no great concern at the moment but I think watch this space, we need to be vigilant.” The symptoms of monkeypox are similar to, but milder, than smallpox - a deadly disease now eradicated. The smallpox vaccine is also around 85 per cent effective at preventing the monkeypox bug because they come from the same family of viruses. NOT A REPEAT OF COVID, BUT CONCERNING  Dr Hilary’s reassuring message came as a UK Government minister said monkeypox is not a “repeat of” Covid-19. Chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News: \"I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. \"There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact.” Britain has around  5,000 smallpox jabs , with orders for another 20,000.  Mr Clarke said he was not aware of reports in the  Sunday Telegraph  of a baby being in intensive care with monkeypox. He said: \"What I would say is we are cautious but we are certainly not in a position where I would in any way worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.\" Official Government guidance now recommends high-risk contacts to  self-isolate for 21 days. The advice applies to anyone who has had  sexual  or household contact with a patient showing symptoms. The virus can be passed on if someone sleeps in, or changes the sheets, of another who is infected.  However, the virus does not usually spread easily between people.  High risk contacts should also stay away from vulnerable people - those with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and children under 12 years old.  The virus can be significantly more harmful in young children. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said “a notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men”. She said: “We are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned.” Dr Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning that \"more cases are being detected on a daily basis\". She added: \"We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country.” Dr Charlotte Hammer, Everitt Butterfield Fellow in Emerging Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge, said: “The increasing case numbers in the current monkeypox outbreak are certainly concerning.  “It is very unusual to see community transmission in Europe, previous monkeypox cases have been in returning travellers with limited ongoing spread. “However, based on the number of cases that were already discovered across Europe and the UK in the previous days, it is not unexpected that additional cases are now being and will be found, especially with the contact tracing that is now happening.” Dr Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, said the escalating outbreak is “undoubtedly worrying”. “The extent of the community transmission of monkeypox, being observed here in the UK and now in several other countries around the world, is concerning,” he said.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18656195/monkeypox-outbreak-unprecedented-dr-hilary-jones-symptoms/"},

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is currently contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases. Those who have been assessed and remain well have been asked to isolate for 21 days in order to avoid the bug spreading. Of the 190 cases, four have been confirmed in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: \"The risk to the general public from monkeypox is still low, but it’s important that we work to limit the virus being passed on.  \"We remind people that they should be alert to new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  \"If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.\" The experts say that while this advise applies to everyone, the majority of infections have been found in men who are gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men.

Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. With that in mind, and with cases continuing to rise, Brits have been urged to be vigilant during Jubilee celebrations this weekend. Millions of people across the country will be taking part in celebrating  70 years of service  of our current monarch. Events  such as street parties, pub gatherings and barbeques are set to take place. Consultant in Health Protection at UKHSA South West Dr Charlotte Bigland said: \"Monkeypox is circulating nationally and internationally, so it’s important to for people to stay vigilant. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. \"There has been a notable number of cases identified among people who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact 111 or their local sexual health service for advice. \"If you think you might have Monkeypox, please phone ahead before attending a healthcare setting in person so we can ensure a good clinical experience.\" Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to the genital areas. But the government has stockpiled vaccines and everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the illness has been given a dose. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

One case of the virus has also been reported by Scotland today. The  monkeypox  outbreak, now spanning some 20 countries, is mystifying health leaders. It is endemic in West and Central Africa, but extremely  rare elsewhere .  However, between 100 and 200 confirmed and suspected cases have been dected in recent weeks across the world. The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said whilst the current outbreak is “significant and concerning”, the risk to the UK population remains low. But people should be alert to the symptoms of the disease, which includes a flu-like illness before a  blistering rash , which starts on the face, hands and feet. A notable number of cases are among men who are gay and bisexual, which is being closely investigated. Monkeypox is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, it can be spread through sexual contact when someone touches the lesions of an infected person.

Coughs and sneezes are also a mode of transmission. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK.  “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms.   “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  said monkeypox is a rare disease but it is important to \"keep an eye on it\". He told reporters on a visit to a school in south-east London: \"It's basically a very rare disease and so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious. \"But it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the the new UK Health Security Agency is doing.\" The Government has  stocks of a vacccine for smallpox  - an eradicated virus of the same family - which is around 85 per cent effective against monkeypox. It is being offered to very close contacts of those who are symptomatic in order to prevent further spread. Although monkeypox has been known for 40 years, the World Health Organization(WHO) noted why this explosion of cases was different. It is the first time there had been several cases without links to travel to the 11 endemic nations in Africa. And it is unusual there are so many cases across many countries simultaneously. The WHO's emerging disease lead Maria Van Kerkhove said the situation was \"containable\".  Meanwhile, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) director, Andrea Ammon, said most of the cases had mild symptoms. \"For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,\" Ammon added in a statement.

The UK Health Security Agency has since updated  guidance for self-isolation  as authorities look to combat the “unprecedented” outbreak. How many monkeypox cases are there in the UK? The UK has so far confirmed 20  monkeypox  cases – with more expected to be announced later today (Monday, May 23, 2022). More than 80 cases have also been  identified across Europe , the US, Canada, Israel and Australia. The disease , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact -  including sex . The UK Health Security Agency has said a notable proportion of cases in Britain and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men. At present, health chiefs are urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. Anyone with unusual skin lesions should seek attention quickly, doctors advise. What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is a usually mild infection, with symptoms including fever, headaches and a distinctive bumpy rash.  The rash often begins on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals.

If infected, the NHS says you will usually need to stay in a specialised hospital so the infection doesn't spread and your  symptoms can be treated. However, the infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Where did monkeypox come from? Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. But outbreaks in Britain, Portugal, Spain and the United States, have triggered alarm among public health experts. According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ), the name monkeypox originates from the initial discovery of the virus in monkeys in a Danish laboratory in 1958. The first human case was identified in a child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. Is monkeypox deadly? The WHO says the monkeypox virus is similar to  human smallpox  and while it is much milder, it can be fatal. However, they stress that “there have been no deaths associated with this outbreak”. Is there a vaccine for monkeypox? In Britain,  authorities are offering a monkeypox vaccine  to healthcare workers and others who may have been exposed. The UK is said to have around 5,000 jabs – which are also around 85 per cent effective at preventing the new bug. And while experts have said the overall risk remains low,  Sajid Javid  has ordered the UKHSA to take a belt and braces approach and secure a further 20,000 doses. It came as another UK Government minister said monkeypox is not a “repeat of”  Covid-19  given the availability of vaccinations. A Whitehall source said: \"Sajid directed procurement of the relevant vaccine months ago as a precautionary measure but we are making sure we are further ahead of the curve by taking decisive action to secure even more of the vaccine. \"We aren’t too worried at this point but will be keeping a very close eye on the situation.

Dr Hopkins, of UKHSA, told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox \"mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18684026/china-labs-monkeypox-outbreak-tests-kits-vaccine/"},
{"title": "UK says monkeypox close contacts should ISOLATE for 21 days with kids among most at risk as more cases to be confirmed", "author": "Jon Rogers", "date": "21:43, 22 May 2022", "text": "BRITS who have had close contact with monkeypox patients should self-isolate for 21 days, the government now says - as more cases are set to be announced on Monday. The updated guidance from the UK Health Security Agency also warns those at risk of  monkeypox  infection to stay away from vulnerable people. That includes pregnant women, kids under 12 and people with suppressed immunity.  High risk contacts include people sharing a house, sexual partners or even someone changing an infected person’s bedding without wearing the appropriate PPE. They should also be offered a vaccine, the UKHSA said. The guidance - which is not a legal requirement - comes after Belgium became the first country to introduce  mandatory 21-day quarantine  for monkeypox patients. As the outbreak explodes across Europe, doctors are warning new infections of the disease are being detected on a daily basis and  will rise significantly . On Friday the total number of confirmed cases in the UK  more than doubled to 20  and that is expected to rise again when the latest figures are released on Monday. One of the cases in the UK is thought to be a child who is currently in a critical condition in a  London  hospital. The cause of the outbreak in Britain is not yet known as there is “no obvious connection” between those infected to a single event, according to the UKHSA’s Dr Susan Hopkins.

Dr Hopkins says it seems to be particularly prevalent in gay and bisexual men. Anyone changing sexual partners regularly or having close contact with people they don't know should come forward if they develop a rash - one of they  key symptoms  - she said. In Spain - which has more than 50 known cases - authorities have linked some to a sauna in Madrid. Other cases in Spain and Italy are linked to  a festival  attended by crowds of 80,000 in Gran Canaria. Meanwhile, US President  Joe Biden  has said the outbreak is “a concern”. And  Austria 's first case of monkeypox was confirmed on Sunday, Vienna's health authority said. Israel  also recorded its first case this weekend. Belgium  currently has three cases, all of which were recorded on Friday and are linked to the four-day Darklands Festival in port city Antwerp. Dr Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, was asked about the risk to Brits attending summer festivals, as well as children on  sunshine holidays. She said the illness is \"relatively mild\" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. \"The risk to the general population remains extremely low,\" she said. But she added: \"People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.\" 'STAY AT HOME' Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\", Dr Hopkins said, and are like \"a viral illness\". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. \"It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,\" Dr Hopkins said. \"They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious. \"If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic.\" Anyone who feels ill must \"stay at home\", Dr Hopkins said. People infected with monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection The NHS says the first symptoms are: They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. Yesterday, Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said  the medical community is bracing for more as the virus spreads. She told Sky News: \"What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. \"It's already circulating in the general population. \"It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks.\" Meanwhile, it has emerged experts warned three years ago that monkeypox would \"fill the void\" left by smallpox. Scientists from leading institutions including the University of Cambridge and the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the disease would evolve to fill the \"niche\" left after smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is usually mild, it can prove fatal in rare cases. The strain causing the current outbreak kills an average of one in 100 infected.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the experts attended a seminar in London back in 2019 and discussed how there was a need to develop \"a new generation vaccines and treatments\". Their discussion was published in the Vaccine journal in 2020. Monkeypox , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact - including sex.

{"title": "Monkeypox ‘may be too late to contain and will be hard to stamp out’, say experts", "author": "Vanessa Chalmers", "date": "11:56, 3 Jun 2022", "text": "MONKEYPOX in the UK will “be hard to stamp out”, an expert has said, as the World Health Organization says it could be “too late”. There have been  190 cases  of  monkeypox  detected in the UK so far, health chiefs say, and 550 worldwide. Professor John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said  the outbreak  will likely last a number of months. Health officials will be using contact tracing to find more cases of the virus and try to contain it. But Prof Edmunds, a leading epidemiologist and scientific adviser to the Government, said it will be a “lot of work” - but ultimately it is controllable. Prof Edmunds said the fact that so many infections have been “cropping up all over the world” indicated there was “going to be a problem”. “You’re not going to get rid of it overnight,” he told  The Independent. “It’s going to take a good couple of months of really solid work to chase up all the infections and contacts and stamp it out. “It will take a while. Public health teams are chasing all of these chains of transmission — some of them are going to be cryptic for all kinds of reasons. “And the incubation period [the time between infection and symptoms] is quite long — nine or 10 days, possibly even longer.

It gives you time to contact trace. On the other hand, if you’re missing some cases, then it’s going to bubble along for a while.” The World Health Organization (WHO) said the number of cases seen so far could be  the “tip of the iceberg”. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the sudden appearance of monkeypox in unlikely countries suggests the virus has been spreading undetected for some time. While it is endemic in West and Central African nations - with 9,000 cases a year - its emergence elsewhere has been unexpected. Dr Rosamund Lewis, the WHO’s monkeypox technical lead, said at a press conference on Wednesday: “We don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain. “What WHO and all member states are trying to do is prevent onward spread.” So far, there have been 190 confirmed cases of monkeypox identified from 6th to 31st May in the UK. Monkeypox appears to be spreading from person to person in England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Wednesday. \"The current outbreak is the first time that the virus has been passed from person to person in England where travel links to an endemic country have not been identified,\" the agency said. According to the UKHSA, the majority of cases in the UK - 132 - are in London. And 111 cases are known to be in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Only two cases are in women. Monkeypox can affect anyone, but many of the most recent diagnoses are the GBMSM community. Many of them live in, or have links to London, said Kevin Fenton, London's regional director for public health. \"As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great,\" he said. Recent foreign travel to a number of different countries in Europe has been reported by 34 confirmed cases, or about 18 per cent. . So far, the UKHSA has identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in Britain and abroad. \"Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified,\" the agency cautioned. Monkeypox typically causes  flu-like symptoms  and pus-filled skin  lesions  that usually resolve on their own within weeks, but can kill a small fraction of those infected.", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18771481/monkeypox-too-late-contain-hard-stamp-out/"},
{"title": "Warning to parents to watch for monkeypox symptoms as child ends up in intensive care", "author": "Terri-Ann Williams", "date": "10:33, 23 May 2022", "text": "A CHILD in the UK has contracted monkeypox as the outbreak continues to spread. Around 20 people in the country have tested positive for the illness, with one of these being a child in  London . It's not known how old the youngster is, but they are currently in a critical condition in hospital. Monkyepox  is a rare disease, with most cases found in Africa. But over the last week the virus has been detected  across the globe . Later today the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are set to announce even more cases. It's important that you know the  signs to look out for , especially in little ones, who might not be able to explain how they are feeling. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said the illness is \"relatively mild\" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. Initial symptoms  are usually \"non-specific\", Dr Hopkins said, and are like \"a viral illness\". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body.

People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. It's important that  parents  also look out for signs that their child is feeling generally unwell. If your child is exhausted they might become irritable and not enjoy the things they usually do. When it comes to taking their temperature, experts have previously warned you should not rely on a t hermometer's traffic light system  for your children. This is because what would be deemed as a concerning temperature for babies, is different from what is concerning for an adult. The  NHS  says a normal temperature in babies and children is about 36.4C, but this can vary slightly from child to child. If they have a high temperature, this will be around 38C or more.
