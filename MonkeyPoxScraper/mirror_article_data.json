While  typical signs of the disease  include a rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, the most recent review of 185 cases - published in the British Journal Dermatology - has identified a new skin symptom related to the illness.  Dr Ignacio García Doval, coordinator of the research from the Spanish Academy of Dermatology, said: \" Our research shows that the symptoms of the current outbreak are unusual and there is evidence that this is due to skin-to-skin contact during sex.\" He added: \"Rather than the typical widespread rash seen in past cases, recent cases tend to have far fewer skin lesions, often in one location.\"  Here's what you need to know about pseudo-pustules, the new  monkeypox  skin symptom identified by experts.  Monkeypox, which comes from the same family of viruses causing smallpox, is often described as causing pustules, which are pus-filled lesions. However, medics have spotted a new sign appearing on the skin in the most recent monkeypox outbreak: pseudo-pustules. Pseudo-pustules are similar in appearance to pustules, except they are white and solid and don't actually contain any pus. While the top layer of typical pustules can be scraped off to get to the pus inside, that's not possible with the pseudo-pustules. This means that lesions from pseudo-pustules can lead to ulcers. This symptom is important to note, with experts warning that there are very few diseases that produce this type of reaction.  People who have been infected with monkeypox typically develop symptoms such as fever, sore muscles, swollen lymph nodes,  headaches  and sweating.  A distinct rash breaks out between one to four days of infections, with lesions developing mostly over the face as well as over the palms, soles and mucosa (the moist, inner lining of the nose and mouth). These lesions generally scab over and fall off, and the infections resolve within two to four weeks. There might be secondary scarring from the rashes as pustules can get very itchy. However, complications may occur in some people including encephalitis, pneumonia, secondary bacterial skin infection, as well as visual loss. Infants, children and those with weakened immune system are at greater risk for developing complications from monkeypox.

{"title": "3 monkeypox symptoms found on the face - 'pimples' to lesions in mouth and throat", "author": "Jessica Knibbs", "date": "10:59, 8 Aug 2022", "text": "Monkeypox was first discovered at the end of the 1950s , but since then there are signs it has undergone recent changes that have enabled it to pass between humans more easily.  Since May 2022 there have a spate of outbreaks reported in the US, UK, Australia, mainland Europe and Canada.  Health officials say that people should avoid close personal contact with someone who has an illness presenting with a distinctive  rash .   This  monkeypox  rash is known to first appear on the face has been described to resemble pimples with other face symptoms to be aware of.   According to recent  NHS  updates, the UK has had 2,432 cases, up 224 since July 21.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is encouraging anyone who develops \"a new, unexplained skin rash\" on any part of the body to seek medical care immediately and avoid contact with others.  Monkeypox symptoms are similar to those of smallpox, including fever,  headaches , muscle aches, chills exhaustion and a rash similar to pimples.  “The rash typically started on the face and spread to many areas of the body,” says the American Academy of Dermatology Association The health site continued: “People usually had between 10 and 150 pox-like bumps on their skin. “Some people developed more than 200 bumps.” According to Rosamund Lewis, World Health Organisation’s (WHO) head smallpox secretariat, a rash appearing starts as red discolouration in the skin. It usually starts on the face and then progresses to the arms and legs, then hands and feet, and then the rest of the body. This phase also lasts one to two days. Next comes what are referred to as papules, when the rash becomes raised on the skin, instead of flat, also lasting one to two days. One study published in BMJ looked at 197 participants, all of whom had tested positive for monkeypox. All participants had lesions on the skin or mucus membranes as their only symptom. These lesions were found to be located to the genital and anal areas as well as in and around the mouth and throat. These rashes around the anus and genitals had not always spread to other parts of the body, and often appeared before symptoms like fever, noted the researchers. The NHS  added: “You should contact your sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters, anal pain or bleeding from your bottom and have either:  The national health body added: “Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people, including sharing towels or bedding, until you've been told what to do.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/3-monkeypox-symptoms-found-face-27645221"},

More than 16,000 cases have now been reported from 75 countries, said WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. According to the latest data available, there have been five deaths. So far, there have been over 2,000 confirmed cases reported in the UK. Monkeypox in humans was first discovered in the early 1970s in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Ghebreyesus said: \"This is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.\" But what are the symptoms of monkeypox and are the reports of penis swelling and pain linked to the virus?  According to the  NHS , monkeypox is a rare infection most commonly found in west or central Africa. There has recently been an increase in cases in the UK, but the risk of catching it is low.  The first symptoms of monkeypox include: These symptoms usually occur one to five days before a rash appears. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body. This can include the genitals and anus.  In a study conducted between May and July 2022, by Julia Bilinska and her colleagues at Guy’s and St Thomas’  NHS Foundation  Trust in London, 31 men out of 197 who had contracted monkeypox complained of penis swelling.  However, as of July 29, the NHS, WHO and US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention do not recognise penis swelling as a symptom of the virus. But all the participants involved in the research did have some form of lesion on their skin or mucous membranes. According to the NHS, monkeypox is usually mild and most people recover within a few weeks without treatment.  Because of the similarity to smallpox, the  smallpox vaccine is believed to offer protection to monkeypox  as well.  The NHS is currently offering the smallpox vaccination (MVA) to those who are most at risk of being exposed to it. This includes: Please call 111 or get in touch with your GP if you are showing symptoms or concerned you have contracted the virus.

The latest figures released by the government suggest that the ongoing outbreak has begun to slow down. It comes as the second death from monkeypox in Europe was confirmed last week. Since the last update, there have been an additional 100 confirmed or highly probable cases.  So far, the majority of people who have been affected are men who are  gay , bisexual or men who have sex with other men.  London remains the epicentre of the UK’s outbreak accounting for 73 per cent of cases. The past few weeks have seen a small number of women confirmed to have monkeypox but, so far, the government said there was no evidence to suggest transmission existed outside of “interconnected sexual networks”. Whilst 22 cases in women have been identified, 99 per cent of all UK cases are men. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said: “While the most recent data suggests the growth of the outbreak has slowed, we cannot be complacent. Be vigilant of and check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. “The smallpox vaccine is being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox in order to offer them protection and to reduce the spread of disease.” England has seen an additional 92 cases reported, with one in Northern Ireland, two in Scotland and five in Wales. London: 1954 (+48) South East: 237 (+4) North West: 150 (+6) East of England: 103 (+1) West Midlands: 85 (+9) South West: 65 (+11) Yorkshire and Humber: 55 (+6) East Midlands: 39 (+6) North East: 29 (0) As things stand the outbreak in England is classified as ‘Level 2’ which is defined as being within a set ‘sub-population’, as in men who are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with other men. The primary method of transmission of monkeypox continues to be through close or sexual contact. Whilst the virus has been detected in air and environmental samples in the hospital room of infected patients, there are no confirmed instances of airborne transmission. A vaccine for monkeypox is currently being offered to those most at risk.   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-monkeypox-cases-hit-2859-27671110"},
{"title": "Monkeypox: Expert reveals all you need to know as virus declared global health emergency", "author": "Alice Peacock", "date": "18:28, 29 Jul 2022", "text": " An epidemiologist is urging the nation to take  monkeypox  seriously and tackle stigma around the disease as it expands to a level that will cause a “significant burden on services”.   The disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, was declared a    global health emergency    two weeks ago by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  More than 19,000 monkeypox cases have been reported worldwide in 76 countries since the global outbreak began at the beginning of Spring. According to figures from the UK Health Agency, there were 2,469 confirmed and 77 highly probable monkeypox cases in the UK as of 28 July 2022 - 2,546 in total. The virus was predominantly being passed on in interconnected sexual networks.  Brits are now being urged to check for rashes or blisters before mingling with others, while a    vaccination programme    against monkeypox is being stepped up by the  NHS .   As health services around the UK fight to get the spread of the disease under control, epidemiologist  Kevin Fenton, t he  Public Health Director for London for London and President of the Faculty of Public Health has answered your questions about how to handle the disruption monkeypox may have on our lives.  “As a newly emerged and infectious disease here in the UK, we should all be concerned, because what we really don’t want to happen is for monkeypox to become established here in the UK and to become endemic,\" Professor Fenton said. While anyone can get monkeypox, the majority of cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Professor Fenton said: “We know that the vast majority of cases that we’re seeing are currently been seen among gay, bisexual, and other men having sex with men, so we’re also keen that that community is very much aware of the signs and symptoms, that they’re getting the vaccines that are now available and that they’re taking care to reduce transmissions. However, the professor said that all of us need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of monkeypox, what to do if we have symptoms we are concerned about and how to manage the disease. “The fact that it’s connected to other outbreaks which are occurring globally, means that it’s a public health priority for us and our members. Public health practitioners across the country are involved in partnership with the NHS in helping to control the outbreak,\" he said.  Professor Fenton said young children, fell into an older age category or were more vulnerable  immunologically, could have more severe presentations of the disease. \"Thankfully we have seen very, very few cases in those age groups at this point, both in the UK and internationally,\" he said. The epidemiologist said health bodies in the UK were keeping a close eye out to see if there were any cases that fell into these brackets. Professor Fenton said it monkeypox was \"not likely\" to become as widespread as Covid, as it was not as easily transmissible. Monkeypox spreads through “very close physical contact between an infected person and an uninfected person” either directly or through infected clothing or bedlinen. “What is more likely if that we will continue to spread within these interconnected networks of men-on-men interconnected networks and their partners,\" Professor Fenton said. \"Therefore it really is important that we work with the most affected networks now, to take them through vaccination, raise awareness and make sure we have good services in place to contain the outbreak,\" Professor Fenton said. Stigma around monkeypox, which was disproportionately affecting particular subgroups within the population, was one of Professor Fenton's main concerns around the UK's response to the outbreak. \"What we’ve learnt from other infectious diseases is that where there is stigma, it will prevent other people from coming forward and being identified,\" he said. \"It may prevent them from getting the treatment that they need, and they often have a worse outcome.\" Professor Fenton said that tackling stigma was \"important\" and was being done by working with the community to ensure transparent messaging and that communication that is going out on monkeypox was culturally competent and relevant to that group. “A lot of the messaging from the UK Health Security Agency has been developed in partnership with with the gay, bisexual and men having sex with men community,\" he said. \"We ensure that we develop services that are relevant to the lives of men - convenient, accessible, friendly and open, but also confidential.\" Monkeypox commonly starts off as a flu-like illness before the infected person develops lesions, blisters, bumps or pustules on the skin, often around the mouth and genital area. “When it is severe, you can have those blisters bumps and the pustules developing around the mouth and the genital area. It can be exceedingly painful and for some people it can prevent them from going to the bathroom, using the toilet effectively,\" Professor Fenton said. “Because of where it is located some people can get bacterial infections and they require admission to hospital for antibiotics and also very strong painkillers. \" While a majority of sufferers in the UK seemed to have \"very mild\" presentations, Professor Fenton said they were now seeing \"significant numbers\" that had a severe infection requiring hospital admission and in some cases, intensive care. \"We have more than 2,000 people who have been diagnosed in the UK; that’s going to be a significant burden on services,\" he said. Professor Fenton said the UK has been at the forefront of not only applying testing for monkeypox but looking at new diagnostic tests for it. \"We do have a variety of tests being done - they have been done in specialist centres but now the test kits and diagnostic kits are available in a variety of healthcare settings, so we’re better able to diagnose monkeypox earlier,\" he said. NHS staff across the country have started vaccinating eligible gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM), and frontline staff at risk of exposure, as well as those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case. The public is being asked to wait to be contacted - with the head of the NHS vaccination programme urging those who are invited to come forward at the earliest possible opportunity. While more severe cases of monkeypox required hospital treatment, Professor Fenton said mild cases of monkeypox could be managed at home. \"The most important thing once people had a diagnosis is that they stay at home and they isolate themselves, so they reduce the risk of spreading it to others. We are asking people now, to help control the outbreak, that once you have a sign of a lump or a pustule around your mouth or your genital area, to not have sex with anyone. Don’t go out and mix, to help reduce the risk of spreading it to others.\" For less severe cases, Professor Fenton said there were clinics which offered check-in services from home where a medical professional would check in on a daily basis to ensure a patient's symptoms weren't getting any worse. “The people who are having more blisters or significant pain, whose blisters are becoming infected, will be advised to come into hospital where they can be isolated and managed as an inpatient. Then they have a range of both antibiotics that may be necessary and antiviral treatments which are given to help reduce the severity of the disease,\" he said. “The thing about monkeypox is that it takes a long time to go through the various phases of the illness,\" Professor Fenton said. \"It starts off with a flu-like illness, it may also be associated with the initial blisters or pustules around the mouth or genital area. The blisters then spread across the body and then they dry, scab and fall off.\" The whole process could take three to four weeks, the epidemiologist said, and those with the disease were urged to stay at home and remain isolated until the last scab has dried up and fallen off.

Spain had  reported its first death  as recently as Friday, shortly after Brazil reported the first monkeypox-related death outside the African continent in the current wave of the disease.  The Brazilian victim was a 41-year-old man who, according to the country's health ministry, also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from July 22, only five deaths had been reported, all in the African region.  The WHO last Saturday declared the rapidly spreading outbreak a global health emergency, its highest level of alert.  In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country.  Of the 3,750 patients on which it had information, 120 or 3.2 per cent had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said without providing further details.  The first death occurred in the northeastern Valencia region and the cause was encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain associated with the infection. Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes,  headaches  and muscle aches.  The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus.  Health bosses have also stressed it's important to check for symptoms of proctitis, anal or rectal pain or bleeding - especially if the individual has had a new sexual partner recently. New York in the US has declared a state disaster emergency to tackle the outbreak with more than 1,383 cases in the state. Brazil, along with the United States and Canada, is among the countries most affected by monkeypox in the Americas, where more than 5,000 cases have been reported to date, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).  The South American country reported 1,066 confirmed cases and 513 suspected cases of the disease, the vast majority (744) in Sao Paulo state, the Health Ministry said.  More than 98 per cent of the confirmed cases in the country are men who have sex with men, with an average age of 33 years, according to ministry data.  PAHO said in a press briefing this week that almost all cases had been reported among men who have sex with men between the ages of 25 and 45, but warned that anyone can get the disease regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.

It is understood to be Europe's first known death and the second outside of Africa in the current outbreak. The five previous reported deaths were all in African nations. Spain’s Ministry of Health confirmed the fatality today as it revealed 4,298 cases have so far been notified. It gave no details about the person who had died and when it had happened. Only 64 of the  confirmed cases  in Spain have been women. Earlier this month when the number of confirmed cases stood at just over 3,000 in Spain, it was identified as the monkeypox world leader. The earliest cases in May were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria. Brazil also reported its first monkeypox death earlier on Friday. The man who died was described as a 41-year-old who also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. Last week the World Health Organisation declared monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. The organisation’s Director General Dr Tedros Adhanmon Ghebreyesus said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was \"high\".

As of Monday July 25, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says of these, 65 infections have been classified as highly probable cases. The increase comes after there were only 2,208 confirmed cases in the UK as of Sunday 24 July. The UKHSA has published the latest epidemiological overview for the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.  The document states that in order to expand the UK’s capability to detect monkeypox cases, some  NHS  laboratories are now testing suspected monkeypox samples with an orthopox polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.  And since 25 July 2022, the monkeypox case definition recognises those who are orthopox-positive as highly probable cases. And those who test positive on a monkeypox PCR test have been classed as confirmed cases. Dr Sophia Makki, National Incident Director at UKHSA, has warned people to make sure they are aware of all symptoms, adding: \"Monkeypox cases continue to rise, with the virus being passed on predominantly in interconnected sexual networks. \"Before you have sex, go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician.\" Speaking about the fact that the NHS is scaling up its monkeypox vaccination programme in London, Dr Makki said: \"Vaccination will further strengthen our monkeypox response and so we urge all those who are eligible for the vaccine to take it up when offered. \"It will help protect yourself and others you have had close contact with. While the infection is mild for many, it can cause severe symptoms and hospitalisation in some. \"Please remember that the vaccine may not provide complete protection against monkeypox, so it is still important to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and call 111 or a sexual health clinic if you develop any.\" She continued: \"The NHS will provide the vaccine to those eligible, so please wait until you are contacted.\" It is important to note that monkeypox can spread from person to person in different ways. The virus can spread though direct contact with the infectious rash and scabs, and through body fluids, including:  • Touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash   • Touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs (including during sex)   • The coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash  Monkeypox can occasionally be deadly, especially in places with inadequate health care. Although, over 99% of people who contract the disease are likely to survive. Though infections are generally mild - with illness from the virus typically lasting two to four weeks - the virus can be dangerous to certain people. Even if not fatal, symptoms of monkeypox can be quite painful. Some people have reported to be experiencing permanent scarring from the rash.

A vaccination programme against monkeypox is being stepped up by the  NHS  as more supplies of a jab come on stream.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine as monkeypox cases continue to rise. As of July 18, there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. While anyone can get monkeypox, the majority of cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  Global outbreaks of monkeypox were noted in May and now  The New England Journal of Medicine  has published its findings after the largest review so far of the virus covering 16 countries.  It is known to cause flu-like symptoms and rashes with small spots which blister before scabbing over. But now other new symptoms have also been discovered. “These symptoms include single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. Statistically one in ten people had a single skin lesion in the genital area and 15% had anal or rectal pain said Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London. While Professor Chloe Orkin, of the same London university and Director of the SHARE collaborative warned about the spread of the virus. She said: “Viruses know no borders and monkeypox infections have now been described in 70 countries and in more than 13,000 people.” Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. While the vaccine is available across England, London will receive additional doses of the existing supply in an effort to break chains of transmission as quickly as possible. NHS England said thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted about getting their jab as plans are scaled up and more supply becomes available. The public should wait to be contacted about a vaccine. In London, there are more than 18 clinics offering vaccinations including Dean Street sexual health clinic in Soho, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Guy's Hospital in Southwark, Mortimer Market Centre in Camden and Barking Hospital Outpatient Centre East. Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: \"While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. \"On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible. \"The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice. \"Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful Covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected. \"We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/new-monkeypox-study-warns-virus-27547336"},
{"title": "Monkeypox common questions answered - links to STIs and fatality rates", "author": "Malvika Padin", "date": "09:00, 6 Aug 2022", "text": "Monkeypox  is a viral infection coming from the same family as the smallpox virus, and has been spreading rapidly around the globe.  With two  deaths being confirmed in Europe , monkeypox  symptoms  tend to cause extreme pain and discomfort across many parts of the body, sometimes being severe enough to cause permanent scars on the skin as well as damage to the brain, eyes and lungs. The disease is also thought to pose more serious risk to vulnerable populations, such as children and the immunocompromised.  Monkeypox is a viral infection that was first discovered in monkeys in 1959 and in humans in the early 1970s.  The disease is typically self-limiting and should resolve itself with time.  Though it's quite similar to smallpox in terms of symptoms, monkeypox tends to be milder and less likely to cause death.  Common monkeypox symptoms include: The rashes often begin as flat lesions that become raised, looking similar to blisters or pimples.  These pustules are typically filled with fluid or pus. But there may be some  pseudo-pustules that don't have pus  but lead to ulcers. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection(STI), with Toronto-based infection control practitioner Erica Susky explaining that people are mislabelling the disease.  She said: \"The misconception is that it is a sexually transmitted infection, but close contacts of a non-sexual nature may also be a source of transmission. For example, close skin-to-skin contact, hugging, kissing, and close face-to-face contact.  \"All of these contacts may not be sexual in nature, though sexual contact is also an opportunity for viral transmission.\" So, while monkeypox can spread sexually, it is not actually the primary mode of transmission. Instead, skin-to-skin contact is.  This contact may include: The West African type of monkeypox that is now spreading is rarely fatal, according to Dr Douglas Chiriboga of Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center. However, it can be deadly for certain sections of populations, including unvaccinated children and immunocompromised populations.  Research is currently being conducted to learn more about how to treat the disease and prevent serious complications.  There is currently no known cure for monkeypox, however some treatment may work. Some people who have obtained the drug Tecovirimat (brand name TPOXX) from the CDC have reported that it helped clear their rash faster and reduce their pain, according to Dr Jay Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response. Generally, even without any treatment or cure, monkeypox goes away on its own after two to four week.s  According to Dr Jay Varma, people receiving one of two available vaccines for smallpox seem to have effective protection against monkeypox.  This includes:  The vaccine is estimated to be around 85% effective at monkeypox prevention, however research on this is limited for now.  The vaccines are recommended for those who may have been exposed to monkeypox in the past four to 14 days, as well as those in occupations like laboratory work.  If someone has been infected with monkeypox, they are contagious until their rash has completely disappeared.

{"title": "Monkeypox 'set to be declared health emergency' as cases rise at alarming rate", "author": "Tim Hanlon", "date": "01:56, 28 Jul 2022", "text": "Monkeypox is set to be called a public health emergency in the coming days by the United States, it is reported.  It comes as the  World Health Organization  has said that there have been more than 18,000 cases of monkeypox reported globally from 78 countries, and with the majority in Europe.  The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency last Saturday.  Scientists advising the WHO on  monkeypox  say the window is closing to stop its spread, with cases currently doubling every two weeks, raising concerns that it will take several months for the outbreak to peak.  And the Department of Health and Human Services in the US is expected to also declare an emergency that would allow it to then receive more money and personnel to tackle the outbreak.  A decision could come by the end of the week, reported  Politico , citing two insiders with knowledge of the situation.  “I do think it deserves to be one,” reportedly said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We’re having a lot of challenges around the country with their rate of rise in terms of new cases. It isn’t an emergency posing a … high threat to the general population. But it’s still moving … and has the potential to spread to additional vulnerable communities.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did say on Wednesday it plans to make the rapidly spreading monkeypox disease a nationally notifiable condition. The designation, which is set to take effect on August 1 updates criteria for reporting of data on cases by states to the agency and would allow the agency to monitor and respond to monkeypox even after the current outbreak recedes, the CDC said. Over 3,500 monkeypox cases were reported in the United States as of Tuesday, according to the CDC. States will be required to report confirmed or probable monkeypox cases within 24 hours. The CDC asked for data to be shared even before the investigation of a case was completed. State health departments are currently not required to provide the federal government with standardized data on monkeypox. The disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, was declared a global health emergency by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in an unprecedented move after a majority of members of an expert committee voted against it. WHO Europe has forecast just over 27,000 monkeypox cases in 88 countries by August 2.

The Ministry of Health  of the Government of the Canary Islands declared a health alert that there have been 96 confirmed cases, of which 65 were detected in Gran Canaria, 29 in Tenerife and two in Fuerteventura.   It has been reported by  El Dia  that all active cases are experiencing mild symptoms but are remaining in home isolation and receiving follow-up care.  Authorities are now trying to halt the outbreak that has exploded across the Islands, which are a tourist hotspot that attracts millions of visitors every year.  Meanwhile, the  World Health Organization  's emergency committee convened today to consider - for the second time within weeks - whether to declare monkeypox a global crisis.  Dr. Hugh Adler, who treats monkeypox patients in Britain said: “If reclassifying monkeypox as a global emergency will make (vaccines available), then maybe that’s what needs to be done. “But in an ideal world, we should be able to make the necessary interventions without the emergency declaration.” There are now more than 15,000 monkeypox cases worldwide, with United States, Britain, Canada and other countries buying vaccines against it. In the UK, the NHS is stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab come on stream. And in the US, officials have announced that more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses were being sent to states in the next few days. There are also plans of ordering several million more for the months ahead. Active cases have so far been detected in: Israel, Norway, Thailand, Australia, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.  Symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever and chickenpox-like blisters, which the  NHS  say the disease is often confused for.  One to five days after a person's symptoms appear, they may break out with a rash - often beginning on face before spreading to different parts of the patient's body. However, according to the health service, symptoms tend to clear between two to four weeks.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has expanded the symptom list to include a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus and surrounding area, along with lesions in the mouth. Health bosses have also stressed it's important to check for symptoms of proctitis, anal or rectal pain or bleeding - especially if the individual has had a new sexual partner recently. These additional symptoms will help both individuals and clinical professionals identify monkeypox symptoms. However, the majority of people with monkeypox can safely manage their symptoms at home as there have been no deaths in the UK. Most people experience mild disease but it can cause a significant illness in some requiring hospitalisation for symptoms such as severe pain. Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at UKHSA, said: \"We continue to see new diagnoses of monkeypox, passed on primarily through close or sexual contact. \"We have updated our case definitions to reflect the clinical presentations that have been seen during this outbreak. \"It is important to recognise that just one or two genital or anal lesions, or lesions in the mouth can be signs of monkeypox, especially if you have had a new sexual partner. \"If you think you have monkeypox stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Health officials are still urging people to be cautious and to stay alert for symptoms. For many people symptoms can be mild but for some people, hospital treatment may be required. Guidance and materials are being updated to reflect the new case definition and expanded symptoms list.  The first  symptoms  of monkeypox include:   According to the  NHS , if you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between 5 and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear.  A rash usually appears one to five days after the first symptoms. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body which can include the genitals and anus.  However, the rash is sometimes confused with  chickenpox .  It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs which later fall off. The symptoms usually clear up in a few weeks. While you have symptoms, you can pass monkeypox on to other people.

{"title": "How does monkeypox spread and is it dangerous as virus declared global health emergency", "author": "Malvika Padin", "date": "11:51, 25 Jul 2022", "text": "Monkeypox  is not a new disease, having first been detected in humans in 1970.  However cases of the virus have been increasing throughout this year.  With more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox now being recorded in 75 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the expanding  outbreak of the virus as a global health emergency .  Symptoms of the monkeypox virus , which is part of the same family of viruses that causes smallpox, consists mainly of rashes or lesions appearing on different parts of the body.   Other symptoms include high fever,  headaches , muscle pain, chills, swollen lymph nodes and exhaustion.  But is dangerous and why has it been declared a global health emergency? Here’s what you need to know. Monkeypox can spread from person to person in different ways. The virus can spread though direct contact with the infectious rash and scabs, and through body fluids. It can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact, or during intimate physical contact like kissing, cuddling or sex. Among pregnant people, the virus can potentially spread to the foetus through the placenta. People can even catch monkeypox by touching items like clothing or bedding used by an infected person. It's possible for the disease to spread not just from person to person, but from infected animals as well. This can happen if you're scratched or bitten by an infected animal, or if you eat the meat or use products from an infected animal. Monkeypox can spread from the time symptoms start till the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed over the lesions. If a person doesn't have any symptoms of monkeypox, they cannot spread the virus to others. Monkeypox can occasionally be deadly, especially in places with inadequate health care. However, over 99% of people who contract the disease are likely to survive. Though infections are generally mild with illness from the virus typically lasting two to four weeks, the virus can be dangerous to certain people.  Those with weakened immune systems, those with a history of  eczema , people who are pregnant or breastfeeding as well as children under eight years of age are more likely to get seriously ill or die from the monkeypox virus.  Even if not fatal, symptoms of monkeypox can be quite painful, with people even experiencing permanent scarring from the rash. The WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared monkeypox a global health emergency. The classification is the highest alert that the WHO can issue and means the monkeypox outbreak is an \"extraordinary event\" that could spill over into more countries and requires a coordinated global response. The emergency declaration serves as a plea to get more global resources and attention to an outbreak. Mr Tedros said: \"In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulation.\"  WHO has previously declared emergencies for public health crises like the  COVID-19  pandemic, West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak in Latin America.

{"title": "Monkeypox and Chickenpox key differences – main symptoms and how to tell them apart", "author": "Ariane Sohrabi-Shiraz", "date": "11:07, 25 Jul 2022", "text": " A  global health emergency has been declared  by the World Health Organisation (WHO) due to the spread of the monkeypox virus.  More than 70 countries are now experiencing an \"extraordinary situation\" due to the spread of the virus.  As the number of  monkeypox  cases in the UK continues to climb, it's important to be aware of the symptoms of it to avoid it spreading further.   According to the  NHS  the rash caused by monkeypox is sometimes consumed with  chickenpox , which is a common illness in young children.  It's important to know that there are several key differences between the two, so you know what steps should be taken further. It usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of monkeypox to appear. The first symptoms, according to the NHS, are: A rash will also usually appear after one to five days of the first symptom. This will often start on the face, before spreading to other parts of the body, including genitals and anus. The main symptom of chickenpox is an itchy, spotty rash which can appear anywhere on the body. This usually happens in three stages – first small spots appear, then the spots become blisters and then they become scabs. Other symptoms include a high temperature, aches and pains, generally feeling unwell and loss of appetite. The most important difference is that they are caused by difference viruses. Monkeypox comes from the orthopox virus, while chickenpox comes from the varicella zoster virus, which also causes shingles. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness which causes an itchy, spotty rash. It mostly affects children but you can get it at any age. As the monkeypox virus also causes a rash, it can sometimes be confused with chickenpox. According to the NHS, monkeypox rashes start as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These usually form scabs and then fall off. Both can be spread through direct contact with skin lesions and recently contaminated objects, or close contact due to respiratory droplets. GP and TV Personality Dr Nighat Arif has said that it is possible to tell the difference between the symptoms. For example, you might find your child's \"temperature will be higher with monkeypox, and they may complain of backache, lower leg aches, chills, and very tender glands around their neck”. She added that the “blisters are bigger [with monkeypox]. The chances of them having it are very slim if they haven’t travelled or been in close contact with someone who has.\" You should call a GP if your child has a rash with blisters and has been in contact with someone who has or might have monkeypox, or has been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks. They should stay at home and avoid close contact with other people, including sharing towels or bedding. You should also call the GP surgery before going to visit. If you have, or suspect your child has chickenpox, the infected person needs to stay away from school, nursery or work until the spots have formed a scab. For chickenpox this is usually five days after the spots first appeared. You should always speak to your GP if you're not sure it's chickenpox, or if the skin around the blisters is hot, painful or red.

Luke Shannahan, from Texas, US, revealed he only knew he had been exposed to the virus when he was informed by the  Dallas Health Department  through a track and trace call.  Prior to being told he had monkeypox Luke had been attending pool parties, socialising with friends, and going to music gigs - with all close contacts now testing positive. This has meant Luke has been forced to isolate for the last three weeks and he has described the symptoms as “complete hell”. He told Houston’s KHOU 11: \"You have these blisters that are inflamed and anytime it grazes something or touches something. \"It literally feels like someone is taking a potato peeler to your skin. The entire pain was just constant.\"  Luke believes the monkeypox symptoms are \"100 times worse” than  Covid  symptoms, which he contacted last summer.  Although Luke's had a monkeypox vaccination he has warned of the horrendous whole body rashes which blistered and caused him immense pain - along with swollen lymph nodes. He admitted: “It’s the most traumatic experience I’ve ever had. It’s the worst sick I’ve ever been.” The virus, which can spread through bodily fluids and through socialising with close contacts, has largely been spread among gay men up until now. However, it's been reported Texas just identified its first case in a woman. And Luke wants to raise awareness of the virus as it can affect everybody - not just gay men. “It definitely is something that we need to be paying attention to,\" he said. \"This is not just a gay illness, this is not something that just affects gay men that have sex with men. \"This is definitely something that can affect everybody.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/man-describes-monkeypox-battle-like-27526767"},
{"title": "Monkeypox declared global health emergency by WHO after surge in cases", "author": "Dave Burke", "date": "15:22, 23 Jul 2022", "text": "The World Health Organisation has declared monkeypox a global health emergency. In a statement this afternoon WHO said the outbreak in more than 70 countries is an \"extraordinary\" situation that now qualifies as a global emergency. The UN health agency's declaration could spur further investment in treating the once-rare disease - and also worsen the scramble for scarce vaccines. Although monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere. The UK had detected just seven cases prior to 2022, but earlier this week there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. Declaring a global emergency means the monkeypox outbreak is an \"extraordinary event\" that could spill over into more countries and requires a coordinated global response. The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the  Covid-19  pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. The emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak.  Yesterday  The New England Journal of Medicine  published its findings after the largest review so far of the virus covering 16 countries.  It is known to cause flu-like symptoms and rashes with small spots which blister before scabbing over. But now other new symptoms have also been discovered. “These symptoms include single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. Statistically one in ten people had a single skin lesion in the genital area and 15% had anal or rectal pain said Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London. Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. While the vaccine is available across England, London will receive additional doses of the existing supply in an effort to break chains of transmission as quickly as possible. NHS  England said thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted about getting their jab as plans are scaled up and more supply becomes available. The public should wait to be contacted about a vaccine. In London, there are more than 18 clinics offering vaccinations including Dean Street sexual health clinic in Soho, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Guy's Hospital in Southwark, Mortimer Market Centre in Camden and Barking Hospital Outpatient Centre East. Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: \"While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. \"On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible. \"The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice. \"Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful Covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected. \"We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-monkeypox-declared-global-health-27558190"},

Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School in Surbiton, South West  London , took advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to ask some pupils to leave the premises while contact tracing was underway.   The  school , for children aged 3 to 11, remains open but parents have been told to contact  NHS  111 if they notice any unusual blisters or rashes on their kid's body, reports  MyLondon .  A UKHSA spokesperson said: “We’re working with Kingston Council to provide public health advice to Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School following a confirmed case of monkeypox in the school community. “When cases of monkeypox are identified we rapidly investigate and carry out detailed contact tracing to assess who may have come into contact with them and what their contact was. “Following our risk assessment, the appropriate health information and advice is provided to the contacts so that they know symptoms to look out for and what action to take e.g. vaccination. “Any parents concerned about unusual rashes or blisters on any part of their child’s body should contact NHS 111, whilst adults can contact NHS111 or their local sexual health service. Both adults and children should avoid contact with others until they receive advice.” The health agency added that it was an ever-evolving situation and advice is under constant review.  It follows the World Health Organisation (WHO)  revealing last month  that two children in the UK have been infected with monkeypox.  The agency said it was investigating reports of infected children in Britain, as well as following up reports in Spain and France. None of the cases in children had been severe, the health authority said at the time. Between May 6 and July 11 this year, there have been 1,735 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, and 1,229 of these were Londoners, according to UKHSA figures. This compares with only seven cases recorded in the UK between 2018 and 2021.  London Mayor  Sadiq Khan  has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the spread, and has written to the recently appointed Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, urging him to act.  This follows calls by health charities including the National Aids Trust and the Terrence Higgins Trust for the NHS and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) to combat the outbreak as soon as possible. On Thursday evening, Mr Khan said: \"Today, I have written to the Health Secretary over the growing number of monkeypox cases in London and the UK. \"London is currently seeing the highest rate of infection and I'm deeply concerned that reported monkeypox cases have doubled in less than a week.  \"If we have learned anything from the  Covid-19  pandemic, it's that early action and coordination is vital to get ahead of the curve. The Government must rapidly ensure that there's a coordinated and resourced approach to tackle the threat faced by monkeypox now.  \"I have let the Secretary of State know that City Hall will do everything it can to ensure Londoners have the information and support they need.\" Most people affected by the virus during this year's outbreak have been men, at 99.4%, according to the UKHSA. For confirmed cases where gender information was available, 1,633 were men and only 10 women. Sexual health charities have warned that the increased burden to their services caused by monkeypox also risks jeopardising the Government's target of ending new HIV cases in the UK by 2030. Monkeypox is related to smallpox and cases are usually found in West and Central Africa, with the virus not often spreading elsewhere. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Most patients experience a fever, body aches, chills and fatigue, but some may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.

{"title": "Monkeypox UK - can you get a PCR test for symptoms and where do you go?", "author": "Harry Thompson", "date": "10:23, 30 Jun 2022", "text": "Monkeypox  has fully arrived in the UK, with  1,076  cases having now been reported in the  British Isles  as of June 26 - 79% of which are in London.  Now, a new rapid 90-minute PCR test has been developed by a South Korean firm called Seegene, which will help with the detection and monitoring of the condition. However, at the time of writing, such rapid tests are yet to be rolled out, and longer, lab-based testing is required.  The disease, which is  mainly caught from infected rodents such as mice and rats , can according to the  NHS  be spread from person to person through “touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash\".  The NHS also warns against “touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs (including during sex)\" and avoiding the \"coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash\". Risk in the UK remains low, and people are only encouraged to encourage a clinic if “you've been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they've not been tested yet) in the past three weeks”, or “you've been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks”. PCR tests do now exist for the condition, but a series of steps need to be taken before you are able to take one.  Unlike with  Covid-19 , which adopted an increasingly informal approach to testing that saw countless results never even reported, the relatively smaller scale of monkeypox means that tests are carried out through far more clinical and official processes.  A PCR for monkeypox in the UK will only be taken when certain criteria have been met and particular experts consulted. Initially, cases must be brought to local infection clinicians such as infectious diseases, microbiology, virology or genitourinary medicine. After said consultations have been had, samples will be taken from patients “who clearly meet the possible or probable case definition”. In other cases, there may be a degree of uncertainty or urgency to the process. In this case these people will be seen by the local infection clinician, who in turn will discuss with the monkeypox clinical support line. This is a 24-hour-a-day helpline and is for emergencies only. From here decisions about testing and next steps will be made. According to the government website, the following steps are taken when sampling for monkeypox. Unlike how Covid tests swabs are taken, this time they are taken from an open sore suspected to be caused by monkeypox. The gov website says: “Ensure that the sample is definitely taken from a vesicle, an ulcer or a crusted vesicle. Rub the swab over the lesion and place the swab in the viral culture tube or viral transport medium.” The tests, which are done by medical professionals and not by the person who suspects they may have the condition, are then sent off. For high-risk patients who have come into contact with confirmed cases but do not themselves have any symptoms, a throat swab is taken.

{"title": "Sexual health worker reveals horrific battle with monkeypox that left him in hospital", "author": "Sam Ormiston", "date": "22:41, 7 Jul 2022", "text": " A man ended up in hospital for weeks with  monkeypox  after noticing horrific lesions on his face, days after mistaking his symptoms for long Covid.   Harun Tulunay first noticed that he was unwell when he was struck with a fever in the second week of June, after recently contracting  coronavirus .  But when his Covid test came back negative and his fever reached temperatures approaching 40C, the alarm bells started ringing.  Though most cases of the virus have been mild, the 35-year-old ended up needing urgent treatment in  hospital  - and was isolated in a room on his own.   Harun, who lives in Shoreditch, North London, was forced to cover himself in four blankets to keep his body warm while he was feeling chills - despite the rest of the capital being in the middle of a heatwave,  MyLondon reports .  With most of his friends still in Turkey, where he was born, Harun was battling high fevers, chills and painful swollen glands under his ears alone without his friends and family. He began to develop a red and white rash, which he passed off as a side effect of the high fever he was suffering. It wasn't until he checked a mirror after two days of being incredibly ill that he spotted the small lesion on his nose. Harun, a public speaker and advocate at sexual health charity Positively UK, said: \"I was unable to sleep and I was burning up with fever 38 degrees Celsius. The rash started out as red and white, I didn't have any blisters or anything. \"A couple of days later when I checked myself in the mirror, I noticed a little lesion on my nose but I didn't give much thought to it and had no idea it could be monkeypox. \"I thought it was acne or something.\" Working in sexual health, Harun was well-versed in monkeypox and its symptoms but as he had not seen the same kind of rash or lesions most commonly associated with the disease, it didn't occur to him that he could have caught it. Unsure what was happening to his body, it was a scary time for Harun who just wanted to know what could be done to help him begin to feel better again. He said: \"When my fever and pain hadn't changed for a whole week, my friends became really concerned and so I reached out to 111 for help. I called five or six times when my fever was high and each time I told them the symptoms I was experiencing. \"At this point my fever was so high I was passing out and couldn't move. I would get asked the same questions over and over again - the answers were always the same. \"They said 'if you get worse call us' and each time I got worse the next day and when I called them the response was the same. My diagnosis was delayed a lot because of this, but I don't blame them.\" Harun was referred to his GP after his condition continued to worsen. He had been diagnosed with HIV back in 2016 and there was initial concern that his HIV medication, which means that he can live with the virus and not transmit HIV to anyone else, had stopped working. Harun was advised to get in touch with his sexual health clinic, and after explaining his symptoms as well as noticing the rash on his nose he was advised to be tested for monkeypox. He took an isolated route through the sexual health clinic as well as wearing a mask and covering up his lesions on his nose since it was still unclear what was making him unwell. When he was tested for monkeypox he said that \"they hadn't seen a case like his before\" and his \"symptoms were not the ones they had seen with other people.\" Harun added: \"There are only one or two labs in London that can test for monkeypox and until you get a positive result there's nothing to be done. \"Because we know very little about this condition people are afraid of it. I went to the A&E and they didn't know what to do other than keep me isolated and gave me painkillers.\" Harun was hospitalised after he became unable to swallow his own spit, eat food or drink liquids and as he was uncertain what was happening and living alone, it became overwhelming for him to deal with. He said: \"I just wanted to know what is happening to me and what action can we take, I didn't want to die from a high fever - my concern was not knowing what I had. \"After having been in A&E I was waiting on results from Homerton and I began to get worried about my fever. I'm completely alone in the UK, I don't have anyone with me. \"I was unable to swallow my spit, drink or eat and I cried to a nurse on the phone saying that I'm alone, even 999 doesn't listen to me, where can I get any help. A nurse then arranged for him to be sent to Royal London Hospital on June 24, where he received treatment. He added: \"I had the worst experience ever in the last few weeks, it was worse than Covid and I've had that twice. I wanted to share my story to educate people and normalise the conversation around monkeypox.

He delivers public speeches and shares his life experiences to tackle stigma and raise awareness of HIV and mental health. He added: \"People out there still think that this is a gay disease and it absolutely isn't an illness that exclusively affects gay people. It's annoying that people are saying this is a gay disease - people commented on my tweets saying that 'oh you're gay, next time use a condom' and all sorts of ridiculous statements that just aren't true.  \"I want to make one thing clear, I've not shared my story to to tell people that they'll become like me if they catch monkeypox, my case is really rare - I want to tell people to watch out for the symptoms and be sensible. If you have a fever, swollen gland or  sore throat , stay at home, if you have blisters call your sexual health clinic.  My mental health has been messed up, all this uncertainty felt like the first days of Covid. \"People were really agitated and anxious then and that's how I felt.

Cases are up from 910 on Friday, it has been confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency. Latest figures show 1,035 cases in England, five in Northern Ireland, 27 in Scotland and nine in Wales. Almost 90 per cent, 659, cases reported a home address in London. The South East and North West have the next highest figures. The Agency, which will be publishing updates twice weekly, said it expects to confirm more cases in the coming days. Dr Sophia Makki, Incident director at UKHSA, said: “The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.  \"We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. \"If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on. \"Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.  \"We are grateful to all the people who have come forward so far for testing and to assist us with our contact tracing.” The virus, which was first found in humans back in 1970, has been detected in 35 countries where it is not endemic in the past month. Monkeypox  has been linked to 66 deaths in Central and West Africa , where it is classified as endemic, since the start of the year. Scientists say it mainly spreads between people through direct, skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact.

{"title": "Health chiefs warn monkeypox now infecting children - 8 symptoms to look out for", "author": "Kelly-Ann Mills", "date": "15:13, 30 Jun 2022", "text": " Two children in the UK have been infected with  monkeypox , the World Health Organisation has revealed, as Brits are warned about what to look out for in their youngsters.   \"Sustained transmission\" of the virus across the world could see it begin to move into high-risk groups, such as pregnant   women, immunocompromised people and children.   The  WHO  said on Wednesday it was investigating reports of infected children in Britain, as well as following up reports in Spain and France.  None of the cases in children have been severe, the health authority said. The virus has now been identified in more than 50 new countries outside the countries in Africa where it is endemic. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters: \"I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest that the virus (is) establishing itself and it could move into high risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women.\"  There have been more than 3,400 cases of monkeypox, and one death, since the outbreak began in May, largely in Europe among   men who have sex with men, according to a WHO figures.  There have also been more than 1,500 cases and 66 deaths in countries this year where it more usually spreads. Last week, the WHO ruled that the outbreak did not yet represent a public health emergency, its highest level of alert. However, Mr Ghebreyesus said the WHO was tracking the outbreak closely and would reconvene the committee \"as soon as possible\" to assess whether this was still the case. The agency said it was also working on a mechanism to distribute vaccines more equitably, after countries including Britain and the United States suggested they were willing to share their stockpiled smallpox vaccines, which also protect against monkeypox. Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This \"incubation period\" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss.

{"title": "British Airways crew in isolation after one tests positive for monkeypox", "author": "Adam May", "date": "09:33, 22 Jun 2022", "text": " A British Airways crew has been put in isolation after one of them is understood to have caught  monkeypox .  Two pilots and nine stewards and stewardesses have all been placed in quarantine for 21 days in Singapore, it has been reported.  The flight is understood to be on  British Airways'  London to Sydney route, which goes via Singapore, and it's thought the positive test came when the crew were returning to the UK.  Health officials reportedly detected the infection in a steward once staff were tested after landing on Sunday evening.  It comes as  793 cases of monkeypox cases have now been confirmed in the UK. Authorities on Tuesday disclosed the case, saying the 42-year-old man had flown in and out of the city state in mid-June. The infection is the first recorded case of monkeypox in South-East Asia linked to the recent global outbreak. A total of more than 2,100 cases have thus far been detected across 42 countries since May. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 80 per cent of cases have been found in Europe, but the disease has also spread to North America, South America and Australia. The WHO has recorded one death in this outbreak.  A British Airways insider told the  MailOnline  : \"One of them had it, so they impounded the whole crew. Now they have got to spend 21 days in quarantine.  \"Everyone has been told not to talk about it – but it's all everyone is talking about.\" A BA spokesperson told The Mirror: \"We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require. \"We’re in contact with our crew and providing the necessary support.\" They added that the safety and security of its customers and crew is always its top priority and the risk to others on board is very low.  Meanwhile,  some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex,  the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.  Smallpox is in the same virus “family” as monkeypox. There is currently no vaccine licensed in the UK or Europe for immunisation against monkeypox. As monkeypox is related to the virus which causes smallpox, vaccines developed for smallpox are considered to provide “cross-protection” against monkeypox. The UKHSA said the smallpox vaccine “is shown to be effective against monkeypox\" but shouldn't be offered out to everyone. It will only be offered to certain gay and bisexual men. Eligibility criteria is likely to depend on a person’s sexual activity. The UKHSA guidance states that a medic may advise vaccination for someone who “has multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends ‘sex on premises’ venues”.  Between May 6 and June 20,  793 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK. Of these, 18 were in Scotland, three were in Northern Ireland, six were in Wales and 766 were in England. Just five cases have been confirmed among women.  The majority of cases are among people in  London - but cases have been found in other regions too.  Symptoms include new and unusual spots, ulcers or blisters anywhere on the body, fever,  headaches , muscle aches, chills, fatigue and swollen glands.  Most people have a mild illness, with recovery within three weeks. But in some cases, severe illness can occur and sometimes results in death. The virus is not currently defined as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close and intimate contact that occurs during sex. Spread of monkeypox can occur when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal or an infected human. It may also occur when a person comes into close contact with material contaminated with the virus such as bedding. Anyone can get monkeypox but the latest cases have been mainly linked to “sexual networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men”, the UKHSA said.

Earlier this week  a class of schoolchildren were sent home , ending their lessons for the year early, when they came into contact with someone with the condition.  The close call has raised concerns monkeypox could spread to youngsters by 2023 to whom it could prove fatal. Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School in Surbiton south London told parents in a letter as a precautionary measure they were closing reception two weeks early. My London  reported the school saying: “The whole of the Reception team and the School leadership are devastated that the end of this academic year is having to finish this way for the children.”  Parents were advised to avoid close contact with their children and to look for symptoms until the end of the month.

Wesley Williams, 34,  became unwell  one day after visiting a sauna on a trip to London but initially thought it was just tiredness.   He broke out in spots 30 minutes into his shift as a waiter at Cheshire Oaks shopping centre and struggled to stand up while serving customers, reports the  Liverpool Echo .  Wesley said: \"I was completely shattered. I was so knackered I couldn’t stand up properly. I was a walking zombie and I really could not move. I had to sit down to take food orders.\" He was sent home to get tested immediately after jokingly suggesting to his manager that he had monkeypox. Wesley continued: \"I thought I was just tired from London so I didn’t say anything straight away. It was my first day back from the trip and within the first hour, I literally nearly collapsed outside. \"The day after I wasn’t tired at all. I was feeling fine but I had started to see some spots appearing around my body. \"I didn’t think anything of it. I joked in work and said ‘maybe I’ve got monkeypox' but my manager sent me home to get tested straight away.\" He tested positive for monkeypox, which he believes he caught at the sauna, after having swabs taken of his spots in Chester. For one week, Wesley's body was covered in small lumps and could only eat soup because he had strep throat. The lumps turned into rashes with blisters by the second week, spreading across his chest and thighs before starting to heal after 16 days. Wesley self-isolated for three weeks and was not provided any medication. He said: \"Monkeypox drained me more than Covid. When I had Covid it felt like the sniffly flu to me.\" His comments come after figures by the UK Health Safety Authority confirmed there were 1,856 confirmed cases in the UK with 1,778 in England, as of July 14.

As of July 8, the UK reported 1,552 confirmed cases, including 1,482 in England, 41 in Scotland, 11 in Northern Ireland and 18 in Wales. The current strain of the monkepox virus  circulating around the world is mutating at a pace faster than expected.  Scientists warn it may have been circulating since 2018 and has mutated 12 times as much as it should have since then. Monkeypox cases numbers are also expected to rise this summer as populations mix at festivals and nightclubs around Europe and the UK. With this in mind, being aware of the early warning signs of the virus is integral. Historically, human monkeypox virus cases in the UK have been limited to imported infections from west Africa. Currently, the UK and several other countries are reporting a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics. In a study  published in the Lancet, symptoms and clinical characteristics of monkeypox virus cases in individuals attending a sexual health centre in London were further investigated.  In the study, patients with confirmed monkeypox virus infection via PCR detection attending open-access sexual health clinics in London between May 14 and May 25 2022 were analysed. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed in 54 individuals, all identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM), with a median age of 41 years. The study found that 38 (70%) of 54 individuals were white, 26 (48%) were born in the UK, and 13 (24%) were living with HIV. One in four patients had a concurrent STI. According to the study, unusual symptoms of monkeypox may include:  According to the  NHS , it takes about five to 21 days for the first monkeypox signs to appear.  When it comes to the characteristic rash, it usually crops up between one to five days after the initial symptoms. The rash might often begin on your face, spreading to other parts of the body as well as your genitals. Being similar to chickenpox, the rash starts with raised spots which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually fall off. Monkeypox usually does not require intervention or treatment, with most people remaining in isolation during their illness. The disease spreads via bodily fluids, including liquid from ruptured pox, blood and mucus. Mild infections should subside after a few weeks without treatment, but severe cases may warrant intervention like hospitalisation.

A  cyber attack  is imminent.  Peter Kosminsky’s latest series The Undeclared War, which started on C4 on Thursday, is set in an all-too-plausible 2024. A near future where more bad stuff happens, such as the entire country being brought to its knees by a terrorist hacker. I’ll just add this to my long list of anxieties, above “buy gifts for school teachers” and below “death of the planet”. The six-part thriller is set deep inside Government Communications Headquarters, where many, many tech nerds secretly analyse code to block cyber attacks. Super-bright graduate Saara Parvin (Hannah Khalique-Brown) begins her work experience at GCHQ, on the same day that a routine stress test suddenly takes down half of the UK’s infrastructure. It’s not clear what’s happening but boss Danny (Simon Pegg being unnaturally serious) looks extremely frazzled. Online banking is down, online shopping is down, no Zoom, no Teams but, strangely, social media is unaffected and it just so happens to be in the run-up to an election. Cyber attack. It’s Russia, right? No one seems sure. The Prime Minister Andrew Makinde (Adrian Lester), who has recently ousted Boris Johnson from leadership, is mostly worried about his unpopularity. Which is mostly because he’s deeply unpleasant. Now the analysts have to crack the code, fast. And Kosminsky has a clever trick so that we don’t spend six hours watching analysts stare at screens. Slick sequences go all Mission Impossible as we visualise what Saara is thinking. Suddenly she’s climbing an imaginary ladder, bouncing an imaginary ball against an imaginary brick wall, opening imaginary locks, a tool belt ready around her waist. It’s clever and engaging, because code otherwise would be boring. Much to the annoyance of all the middle-aged white men in the room, Saara, young, female and Muslim, is the one to spot the virus within the virus. She even gets a round of applause at a COBRA meeting (in the real world, someone else would take the credit), before bigwigs realise she’s just made everyone look incompetent. There is more work to be done to avoid complete disaster. Side plots, including Saara’s father’s suicide and a frisson of a lesbian love ­interest, lend some emotion to this ­otherwise robotic workplace. And the underlying tension of a catastrophe that could actually ­happen makes this addictive and totally bingeable. And who needs sleep anyway?

{"title": "Monkeypox vaccine will be offered to gay and bisexual men in the UK", "author": "Alice Peacock", "date": "17:13, 21 Jun 2022", "text": " Gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to  monkeypox  will be offered a vaccine to help control the recent outbreak of the virus.   It comes as the number of monkeypox cases in the UK has  risen by 219 , with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) having confirmed on Tuesday that the total number of confirmed cases now stands at 793.  Now, a new vaccination strategy published by the agency recommends offering the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, to men considered to be at higher risk of exposure. Imvanex has been shown to be effective against monkeypox. While anyone can contract monkeypox, data from the latest outbreak shows higher levels of transmission within, but not exclusive to, the sexual networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Though the virus is not currently defined as a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed on by close and intimate contact that occurs during sex. The UKHSA strategy has been endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which was consulted on the eligibility criteria for the vaccine. The eligibility criteria would be similar to that used to assess those eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - however would be applied regardless of HIV status. A clinician may advise vaccination for someone who, for example, has multiple partners or attends ‘sex on premises’ venues.  Details on how eligible people can get vaccinated would be set out by the  NHS  in due course, with the health body advising people not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted.  Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: “Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. “Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. “In the meantime, everyone should continue to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they’ve had close contact with a new partner. If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending.” Robbie de Santos, Director of Communications and External Affairs at Stonewall said while anyone can watch the virus, the group welcomed the vaccine being offered to those gay and bi men who were currently at a higher risk. “It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others,\" he added. \"Let’s help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season.” London remains the epicentre of England's monkeypox outbreak, latest figures show, with 498 infections linked to the capital. The South East and North West have the next highest figures. So far 99 per cent of those diagnosed with the virus are male, with just five confirmed female cases, the UKHSA said in its latest daily update. The number of confirmed cases by region are: The agency said the location of 142 cases is still under investigation. In this afternoon's update the UKHSA said: \"Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. \"The outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries.\" The virus, which was first found in humans back in 1970, has been detected in 35 countries where it is not endemic in the past month.  Monkeypox  has been linked to 66 deaths in Central and West Africa , where it is classified as endemic, since the start of the year.  Scientists say it mainly spreads between people through direct, skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. It can also be spread via contaminated objects such as linen and soft furnishings. Guidance issued by the UKHSA urges people to try and eat and sleep in a different room from those they live with if possible. It says: \"Where the use of a separate room isn’t possible, cases should avoid physical contact and keep at least 3 steps (1 metre) away from all household members. \"It is particularly important that they avoid close contact with young children, pregnant women and immunosuppressed people as they may be at higher risk of serious illness.\"  Those diagnosed with monkeypox and highest-risk contacts should isolate at home,  the guidance says .

{"title": "Why is it called monkeypox as scientists set to rename virus over racist connotations", "author": "Malvika Padin", "date": "12:35, 15 Jun 2022", "text": " As  monkeypox  cases continue to rise, with around confirmed 1,600 cases recorded globally in the last two months, scientists are looking for a new name for the virus.   Caused by the monkeypox virus, which is a less severe member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, monkeypox causes a rash that looks similar to  chickenpox.  It's thought it spreads when someone is in close contact with an infected person, with warnings issued  against having sex while suffering monkeypox symptoms. Previously confined to parts of Africa where rodents - not monkeys - were the main animal host, the virus has been spreading around the world.  Here's why the virus was named monkeypox in the first place and why experts want to change the name.  According to the CDC, monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when there were two outbreaks of the pox-like disease among colonies of monkeys kept for research, which is where the name \"monkeypox\" came from.  Though it was first discovered in monkeys, the natural host of the virus remains unknown. However, African rodents and non-human primates - like monkeys - are the most common hosts that carry the virus and infect people. The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), during a time when efforts were being made to eliminate smallpox. Since then, the disease has been reported in several other central and western African countries, though it has now spread to other countries around the world. Experts have expressed the urgent need to find another name for monkeypox virus, to prevent stigma and discrimination towards the disease and its causes. This is because continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, according to more than 30 scientists who are calling for the name change. The current name also doesn't fit the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines that recommend avoiding geographic regions and animal names. According to a WHO representative, discussions between the health agency and scientists over the new name are ongoing, with the aim to find a name that doesn't offend \"any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic group\". One name that's been suggested by scientists is hMPXV, however WHO has not yet confirmed their thoughts on this name. Monkeypox infections have mostly been found to be mild with risk to the general population being low. However, the virus has now spread to 32 countries, with 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and four in Wales, as of Sunday June 12. Though there haven't been any deaths in any of the newly affected countries, including the UK, there have been 72 deaths in countries where monkeypox is already an endemic. The WHO is set to hold an emergency meeting in the next week to discuss whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, which is the highest alarm they can sound on a disease. Previous diseases that have been classed this way are swine flu, polio, ebola, zika and Covid. World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning. For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-renamed-scientists-search-non-27237612"},

The UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) today said it has detected 52 additional cases of monkeypox in England, one additional case in Scotland and one in Wales. This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 524 as of June 14. There are currently 504 confirmed cases in England, 13 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and five in Wales. Last week health chiefs issued new isolation guidance including social distancing - urging those with the virus to sleep in separate beds and stay at least one metre apart from those they live with. The UKHSA said: \"Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.\"  Anyone who has a rash with blisters is advised to contact a sexual health clinic if they have also had close contact with someone who has or might have had monkeypox in the past three weeks, or if they have travelled to West or Central Africa within that timeframe.

Guidance issued by the UKHSA urges people to try and eat and sleep in a different room from those they live with if possible. It says: \"Where the use of a separate room isn’t possible, cases should avoid physical contact and keep at least 3 steps (1 metre) away from all household members. \"It is particularly important that they avoid close contact with young children, pregnant women and immunosuppressed people as they may be at higher risk of serious illness.\" Those diagnosed with monkeypox and highest-risk contacts should isolate at home,  the guidance  adds. The latest figures come as World Health Organisation's Europe director Dr Hans Kluge says the magnitude of the outbreak \"poses a real risk\". He told the briefing: \"The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach and the stronger the disease's foothold will get in non-endemic countries. \"Governments, health partners and civil society need to act with urgency... to control this outbreak.\" According to WHO, monkeypox transmission is being driven by skin-to-skin contact and skin-to-mouth contact, and there is no evidence of a change in the virus. WHO said some 1,160 confirmed cases have been reported in 22 countries in the European Economic Area.  Most cases are mild but WHO said it had seen some complications, and some admissions to hospital.

Officials at the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) are weighing up new names after a respected group of scientists called for it to be \"urgently\" changed.  The virus has swept across the world in the past month, having previously been classified as endemic in parts of central and west Africa. But experts have raised doubts about how widely it had been in circulation around the world, due to lack of testing. There have been 470 confirmed infections in the UK this year - compared to just seven prior to 2022.  In an  open letter  last week 30 international scientists said branding the virus 'monkeypox' is both discriminatory and inaccurate.  They objected to the labelling of the virus having originated in Africa, stating: \"Like many previous geographic labels of infectious diseases based on locations of first detection, it is misleading and inaccurate because very limited surveillance and limited diagnostic capacity means that the full range of the pathogen is not known. \"This is crucially demonstrated by the discovery in May 2022 that MPXV has been circulating in over 44 countries without detection and is likely to be present in many more.\" The letter said identifying monkeypox as an African virus is both \"discriminatory and stigmatizing\" - and said a new way of referring to the disease in widespread circulation is needed. Calling for a new name, they wrote: \"Since viruses in this clade have been transmitting from person to person in dozens of countries and potentially over multiple years, we propose that this represents transmission route distinct from that of previous MPXV cases in humans and should be afforded a distinct name.... \"Whilst the formal naming of virus species is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we believe this is an opportunity for a break with the name monkeypox and the historical associations attached to that name. \"However, we believe that a distinct and convenient name for the virus causing this epidemic would facilitate communication without further negative connotations.\"  The WHO is consulting with experts in orthopoxviruses in order to come up with a more appropriate name,  Bloomberg reports .

As of Friday June 17, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had detected 46 additional cases of monkeypox in England, 3 additional cases in Scotland and 1 in Wales. This brought the total number confirmed in the UK to 574. Updated figures are not expected until Tuesday afternoon.  Since June 8, GPs and other doctors have been required to report any suspected cases of monkeypox they see, and laboratories must also report if the virus is identified in a laboratory sample,  Devon Live reports. This is because monkeypox was added to the list of notifiable diseases by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). These are infectious diseases, such as measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough, which have to be reported to local authorities or local Health Protection Teams. The figures for suspected cases reported locally are much lower than the number of cases confirmed by the UKHSA - meaning there may be more cases in these areas. Numbers may be lower because confirmed cases have not also been reported as suspected cases. In the week ending June 12, 12 cases were reported in England. That was on top of three cases the week before, two cases the week before that, and one case in the week ending May 22.

Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. People are advised to contact a sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and has been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks, or if they've been to West or Central Africa in the past three weeks.  The UKHSA is working with the  NHS  and the public health agencies of across the four nations to investigate the monkeypox outbreak in the past few weeks. As part of this it carried out analysis of the cases up to June 8, as well as anonymised detailed interviews with patients to try to understand transmission and to determine how to target interventions.  Of the cases interviewed, 81% were known to be London residents and 99% were male. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. Of the 152 cases that participated in more detailed questionnaires. In this data, 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same sex contact.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today reminded people heading to festivals and summer events to watch out for the virus. This came as they announced another 46 cases had been detected in England, along with three more in Scotland and another in Wales. As of yesterday, this brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 574. The body's warning comes ahead of next week's festival, one of the highlights of the music calendar. Health chiefs cautioned festival-goers to keep an eye out for the symptoms particularly if they have had multiple or new sexual partners. They said that anyone can catch monkeypox but it was particularly prevalent amongst men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men. The most prominent symptoms of the virus include a rash or blisters. Dr William Welfare, Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “As case numbers of monkeypox continue to rise and with many summer events and festivals ahead, we’re reminding people to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, particularly if you’ve recently had new or multiple sexual partners, to help prevent further spread and protect others. “If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. “Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. \"Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been seen by a clinician. “UKHSA is working closely with partners across the country, including event organisers and venues, to raise public awareness of monkeypox symptoms so everyone has a safe, happy and healthy summer.” England leads the way with the vast majority of the UK’s cases with 550 confirmed cases, Scotland has only 16 with six in Wales and two in Northern Ireland. The UKHSA advised the following people to contact a sexual health clinic: The virus is not a new one and has existed in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the 1970s but in recent months it made the leap to Europe and the west, causing alarm. So far, there have been no reported fatalities from the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned various species - including prairie  dogs , rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice and non-human primates - are susceptible to the  monkeypox  virus.  They have not yet ruled out whether domestic animals - such as cats and dogs - can contract the disease from humans or transmit it to them after picking it up from another animal. However, Blue Cross has confirmed there is currently no evidence of infections in dogs - but has issued guidance to pet owners as more research is undertaken.

Caroline Reay, Head of Veterinary Services at national pet charity Blue Cross, said: “Though there is no current evidence of infection in dogs, the situation is still evolving. “Until we know more, we would recommend that you wash your hands with soap and water before and after contact with your pet or any animal.” Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, backed the advice of people taking care with their pets.  \"It would be a sensible decision to keep your distance from a pet while in quarantine,’ she told the  Daily Mail. \"If I was diagnosed with monkeypox I would do whatever I could to limit contact, such as asking a friend or relative to take care of it.\" She added: ‘There is currently no evidence of transmission between humans and cats and dogs but we know rabbits and rodents are susceptible.  The ECDC said it is important to: \"manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife\", reported the  Daily Record .  They warned that rodents could be effective hosts for the disease, and could spread the virus more effectively than humans. The announcement said: \"If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. \"Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. \"Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low.\" Monkeypox is typically spread between people through physical contact, although it can also spread through contaminated foods, coughing or sneezing, and also contaminated animals.

Chicken pox affects almost all of us at some point in our lives. Though it is widely considered to be a relatively minor ailment,  Yorkshire Live  has reported that some parents in Yorkshire are worrying after hearing talk of an outbreak in the county.  Fears surrounding chicken pox are believed to have grown after a rise in the number of monkey pox infections, with some mistakenly thinking the two are linked. Data from Well Pharmacy last month showed the number of people vaccinated against chicken pox had risen 146 per cent in six weeks before. However, doctors have reassured parents that this chicken pox is nothing to worry about and can be safely handled at home. Now is the time to turn to your parents or grandparents' trusted tonic: calamine lotion. Retired GP, Dr Stuart Oliver, has offered some simple advice to help parents - and their suffering children - through this uncomfortable period. He said: \"If they've got a temperature, then it's Calpol, or just something to bring the temperature down. If it's particularly itchy, then tend to put calamine lotion on it, that's about it. \"Traditionally it's just about bringing down the high temperature with liquid paracetamol, Calpol is the best thing for children, and if it's particularly itchy then calamine lotion, otherwise just leave it.\" This is advice that has been handed down through generations, but still holds true today: don't let them scratch! It can be so hard to stop your little ones from scratching, particularly when it seems to be the only way to get some relief from the agonising itch. But do try to employ the 'cruel to be kind' approach and stop them in their tracks. Many adults still have one or two scars that they can point to as the result of their childhood chickenpox, and the likelihood of the little spots scarring is greatly increased if a sufferer is permitted to scratch. So, make sure that you are on hand with the calamine lotion to help your kids feel more comfortable. Chickenpox, however, can be more harmful to adults or vulnerable people. Vulnerable people include people with autoimmune diseases, pregnant women and newborn babies. Anyone in these groups should seek medical attention if they suspect they have chickenpox.  However,  NHS  inform said: \"Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they've had it before.\"    Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/doctors-chickenpox-advice-parents-cases-27203547"},

{"title": "'I've dodged Covid for years but caught monkeypox at superspreading Spanish sauna'", "author": "Alahna Kindred", "date": "12:07, 8 Jun 2022", "text": " One man who has managed to dodge testing positive for  Covid-19  has told of his experience contracting  monkeypox.  George, who is not using his real name, said he first noticed a black, scabby lesion and tried to  Google  his symptoms.  The 29-year-old said he feared it was a sexually transmitted infection as doctors were baffled when he went to a sexual health clinic. He says he wasn't getting any answers, despite his growing list of symptoms. George says he was fatigued, had horrible back pain and a \"nasty-looking\" black lesion had developed in his groin. He says he also had a spot-like sore break out over his right elbow, stomach and back. The healthcare worker says it was only caught when he went into a hopsital for a secondary throat infection.  He told  The Daily Telegraph  : \"[When I was in hospital] I got a call from the sexual health doctor who said, ‘I think this might be monkeypox’\".  “Suddenly everyone was in PPE and taking it incredibly seriously.”  George is on the first to speak publicly about contracting the virus after  James McFadzean came forward the UK's first patient. George tested positive for monkeypox on May 19 and stayed at the Royal Free Hospital in the infectious disease ward. He said: \"I feel like I managed to dodge Covid, but then suddenly I had monkeypox – at this point, there were, like, less than 10 people confirmed in the UK.\" Describing his time during isolation, George said: \"It felt very much like a Covid situation. One flatmate had gloves, a mask, everything, and asked me to wear that too. It was stressing me out… I felt a lot of pressure to leave, unfortunately, and isolate somewhere else.” After three weeks, he was finally allowed to leave and said he had \"really missed the wind\" on his face. More than 300 Brits have so far been infected with monkeypox in what is the largest outbreak in any country outside of Africa. Monkeypox has now become a 'notifiable disease' in the UK, meaning doctors must tell local health authorities about suspected cases. Last week the UK Health Security Agency released new guidance that advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately. They should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before partaking once more. The guidance comes because the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact, meaning sex could pose as a hotbed for spreading it - but it is not an STI. Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This \"incubation period\" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss. George, who identifies as gay, says he believes he knows where he contracted monkeypox.  He said he and his friend went to Madrid at the beginning of May and went to a sauna that was later described as a  monkeypox superspreader event. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: \"Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox. \"This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. \"It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ive-dodged-covid-years-caught-27177182"},

Just over three weeks since the first UK case was confirmed, the number has steadily increased since with  yesterday seeing the biggest increase in case numbers . The number of cases in England stands at 183, with four confirmed cases in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical advisor at UKHSA, said: \"The risk to the general public from monkeypox is still low, but it’s important that we work to limit the virus being passed on. We remind people that they should be alert to new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  \"If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person. \"UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days.\" The first new monkeypox case was confirmed in the UK on May 7.  The virus has been considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo since it first appeared in the 1970s. In recent weeks, over 300 cases have been detected in Europe and the west, causing alarm in these countries. This comes after yesterday  health chiefs told monkeypox patients to stop having sex  to avoid spreading the virus. They said current evidence indicates it does not spread through genital fluids but physical contact. The UKHSA advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately and said sufferers should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before becoming sexually active again. They also recommend using a condom for eight weeks. Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation warned that the current case numbers could just represent the \"peak of the iceberg\". Speaking last week at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: \"We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event.

James McFadzean, from London, said he suffered a fever, exhaustion and back pain after catching the rapidly-spreading infection. The 35-year-old added that the UK Health Security Agency only contacted him today - nearly two weeks after he was first diagnosed with monkeypox. The HR manager, who is gay, said he tested positive after calling up a sexual health clinic to discuss his symptoms. He told Mail Online he had slept with around 10 new partners in the run-up to falling ill. When he called the clinic, he was advised to take a monkeypox test, which came back positive, he told TalkTV.  More than 300 Brits have so far been infected with monkeypox in what is the largest outbreak in any country outside of Africa. James told Mail Online: \"It’s no wonder now we’re getting so many more infections if no contact tracing or awareness about you not needing the spots to have the virus being told to people \"No-one’s asked me who I’ve been in contact with. I was told that within 24 hours of my diagnosis someone from UKHSA would call me. \"I've called the clinic every day, asking 'why aren’t they calling me, I’m not allowed outside and not allowed to go work. The UKHSA is not calling me, someone needs to document this'.” James told TalkTV that the UKHSA only reached out to him after he went public with his story. He still does not know who he caught the infection from, although he thinks he caught it after returning to Britain from Dubai. Offering an update on his health, James told TalkTV: \"I actually feel much, much better now. It was very rough for the first week. But now I feel fit and well back to normal health. \"I really didn't think I had it. So, everything you hear everything you read talks about this tell-tale rash or lumps or pimples which I never had at any point of the illness. \"I fell ill much like a flu, fever, very exhausted back pain and on the calling local clinic they advised that I should go for a monkeypox test, which I was surprised by but I went along with it and get tested and I got that positive diagnosis.’\" Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.

That kind of seems farcical because every day I've been calling my clinic, the  NHS  Trust trying to get someone to get people to call me so we can do contract tracing so we can identify other people at risk. \"Because I was before the numbers started getting big so if they had trouble containing 50, 60, 70 cases, now they're getting into the hundreds. I can only imagine how long it's taking them to contact those people.\" James added: \"It's not like we haven't just gone through a pandemic which is contagious and we've needed to contact people.  \"If you think, okay, the virus is different, but surely the infrastructure is there. As I said 50/ 60 people at the time I felt unwell. \"How many people just to take to call that many people, two people in a call centre.  \"So yeah, it's frustrating and the response they did to an article 'Oh, we've been trying to contact him non-stop' turned out to be untrue.  \"So just own the mistake. Say we're getting on it and do better.\" In response, Dr Yimmy Chow, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, UKHSA said: “We’ve made multiple attempts to reach this individual by phone and email and would urge them to contact the London Health Protection Team as soon as possible.  “Anyone who suspects they might have Monkeypox, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, should limit their contact with other people and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as they can.” Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests.

{"title": "Five deadly rash symptoms and how to tell them apart from harmless skin issues", "author": null, "date": "14:07, 6 Jun 2022", "text": "Our skin is the largest organ in the human body and it often works as an important early warning sign for a myriad of different conditions.  These dangerous illnesses cause imbalances in our  normal biological functions  which manifest as abnormal spots and rashes on our bodies.   Most rashes are completely harmless and can be treated with creams or antibiotics, but if they develop into certain pustules or swellings it could be essential that you seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms like this can signal often deadly illnesses such as  meningitis , leukaemia, and lymphoma.   With the UK seeing 207 identifiable cases of  monkeypox , a pox virus that causes a rash with pus-filled spots and lesions, paying attention to our skin's health is important. Being able to tell a harmless rash from a worrying rash can save you a lot of worry, as well as an unnecessary trip to your busy GP. This is how you can spot them.    Want to get the latest health news direct to your inbox? Sign up for the Mirror Health newsletter       HERE       Monkeypox is a viral infection originating in west Africa that has seen a resurgence in recent months, with the UK seeing the biggest global rise in identified cases of the disease. While initially contracted from poorly cooked wild meat, the pox virus can also be spread by physical contact with others. Symptomatic infections usually start with a fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. This then progresses into a rash that frequently appears on the face and spreads to other parts of the body.  Ifti Khan, Well Pharmacy superintendent explained to  The Sun  : \"There are several stages to monkeypox. The first developing into papules and fluid filled pustules before forming a scab and falling off. Monkeypox lesions appear and develop at the same time.\"  Papules and pustules  - Papules are raised skin bumps, usually smaller than one centimetre. Pustules look similar, but with a white or yellow pus-filled tip.  Lesions  - As these \"fluid-filled pustiles\" pop, they leave behind damaged skin that will mark the body.   While Monkeypox poses little risk to healthy adults, pregnant women, children and the immunocompromised have been warned to be vigilant for the virus by the World Health Organisation. Those at risk from the illness are likely to be given a monkeypox vaccine by the  NHS .  Meningitis  is a dangerous infection that infects the tissue around the brain and spinal cord that can cause lifelong health issues and even death. While it is most common in children, the infection can also affect adults - especially the unvaccinated.  The most common variant of the disease in the UK is meningitis B, which is mostly spread through droplets when coughing, sneezing, or kissing. Sufferers are likely to first experience a high fever, a stiff neck and drowsiness - with many not developing a rash until the illness develops. The NHS says that this rash will have red or purple blotches, small pinprick spots and will not fade when a glass is rolled over it. If you or your child has a rash that does not disappear, call 999 immediately. Purpuric rash  - As the meningitis bacteria reproduce in the bloodstream, they release toxins which damage blood vessels and organs. The red and purple blotches that appear are areas where blood has begun to pool from this damaged tissue.  Petechial rash  - In contrast, the tiny red pinpricks characteristic of a meningitis infection are known as a petechial rash. They typically occur in areas where the body comes under pressure from items of clothing, such as at the waist or even the soles of the feet.  A positive diagnosis of the disease will result in a hospital stay and, if caught early, the disease has a high survival rate and can be treated with antibiotics. However, those infected can face blindness, deafness and the loss of limbs if the infection develops. Lymphatic cancer is when cancerous cells develop in the network of lymph cells and vessels in our bodies that help our body fight off bacteria and other infections. One of the most common forms of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is 'cutaneous T-cell lymphoma' - or skin lymphoma.  This is where infection-fighting lymphocytes in the skin become cancerous, rather than the skin cells themselves. The symptoms of this are known to resemble shaving rashes, with patches of red irritated skin affecting your limbs and neck, which will start to develop a white scale of skin and resemble  eczema .  Without treatment, lymphatic cancers can be deadly. Catching the early warning signs of a shaving-like rash and scaly skin. T-cell  - These \"white blood cells\" are part of the system of lymph nodes throughout the body that help fight disease.  Cutaneous  - Lymphatic cancers mostly affect the body's internal organs, with \"cutaneous\" indicating that this is cancer occurring in the body's largest organ - the skin.  Leukaemia is a cancer of the blood that originates in bone marrow and spreads into the bloodstream. As the cancer develops, the body's infection-fighting white blood cells and oxygen-carrying red blood cells become crowded out by abnormal leukaemia cells - with fever, fatigue, weight loss, rashes, and bruising the most common early signs of the disease.  As leukaemia damages blood vessels, a  purpuric rash  can develop, as blood pools under the skin resembling bruising. This happens as there are not enough platelets to block and clot damaged blood capillaries.  Inflamed blood vessels can also cause a petechial rash, with widespread tiny red and purple spots developing on the skin - alongside blotchy purple spots. Leukaemia can be both acute, meaning fast-developing, and chronic, meaning slow-developing. Spotting signs such as these rashes can be the only early indicator of the cancer, which is otherwise only picked up by routine blood tests or when the cancer has progressed further. Necrotising fasciitis is a bacterial infection that causes flesh to begin to rot and die off. Though infections are relatively rare, they can be caused by any minor cut that allows the necrotising bacteria into the body. The onset of symptoms are quick, with the affected area swelling and developing a dark purple rash. This then blackens and develops pus-filled blisters as the tissue begins to die.  Cases of necrotising fasciitis are frequently fatal, with 20 per cent of infections resulting in death. Within five days of infection, many of those afflicted will experience dangerously low  blood pressure  and a high fever.  Identifying the swelling and dark purple rash early are essential to getting the appropriate medical treatment, which can include surgery to remove the necrotic flesh before it spreads further. Our skin can be the canary in the coal mine when it comes to serious medical ailments in our own bodies. While most rashes are harmless, being able to spot an abnormal rash can make all the difference when it comes to early treatment of some serious illnesses. If you notice small red spots developing underneath the top layer of skin, it can be a sign that your blood is struggling to clot - meaning that your body is producing an abnormal amount of platelets. This could be an indicator for Hepatitis or HIV infections, as well as some genetic conditions. If your skin appears darker or thicker in some areas than others, it could be an indicator of cancer or diabetes. Known as acanthosis nigricans, these patches will be dry and with a different texture to the surrounding skin. Specifically for diabetes, this can occur on the neck, armpit, or groin and indicates that you have too much insulin in your blood. Some rashes can be as a result of a drug reaction. A rash that covers a widespread area is a typical reaction to many drugs, and can persist for weeks after taking them. It is important to inform your doctor if you experience a rash after taking new medication.

{"title": "Monkeypox cases triple around the world with Europe at epicentre of outbreak", "author": "Will Maule", "date": "00:46, 6 Jun 2022", "text": "Cases of the monkeypox virus have tripled around the world - but the World Health Organisation (WHO) is confident that the spread does not merit a label of \"endemic\".  The WHO has said there were at least 780 cases of  monkeypox  discovered from May 13 to June 2 and currently assesses the global risk level as \"moderate\".  Globally, the UK has the highest number of new cases with 207 outside an endemic area, followed by Spain with 156 and Portugal with 138. Overall, most of the new cases are in Europe and North America as well as a handful in Mexico, Argentina, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Health experts have said the risk to the general public \"remains low,\" however, there is the chance that this risk could be heightened if the virus continues to spread in new countries.  The  WHO  warned that Europe remains \"at the epicentre of the largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported outside of endemic areas in western and central Africa\".    Get the news you want straight to your inbox.           Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here       The organisation said that the rapid transmission had been aided by the lifting of travel restrictions and warned that large in-person events over the summer could threaten to aid the spread of the virus. \"Rapid, amplified transmission has occurred in the context of the recent lifting of pandemic restrictions on international travel and events,\" the WHO explained. \"The potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is high. Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the Region. \"Over the coming months, many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur. \"But they also provide powerful opportunities to engage with young, sexually active and globally mobile persons to raise awareness and strengthen individual and community protection.\" People who closely interact with someone who is infectious are at greater risk for infection, and this includes household members, sexual partners, and healthcare workers. There is speculation from health officials that the virus has been in circulation for longer than originally thought. Dr. Rosamund Lewis, the WHO's technical lead for monkeypox said: \"There may have been undetected transmission for a while. \"What we don't know is how long that may have been. We don't know if it's weeks, months, or possibly a couple of years.\" The virus is spread through close contact, including contact with the skin rash of someone infected with the virus. It begins with symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion, before progressing to a rash which often appears on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. The distinguishing feature of monkeypox compared to smallpox is the swelling of lymph nodes. The illness typically lasts from two weeks to a month. The incubation period of the virus is between five and 21 days, at which points symptoms are likely to appear. The virus rarely kills healthy adults, according to the WHO. However, it can be dangerous to children, pregnant women and those who are immunocompromised.

Following on from the first UK case recorded earlier this month, on May 7, the number has since risen with hundreds of cases now known worldwide. Four of the UK's confirmed cases are in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland, one in Wales and the rest in England. The large jump in cases is due to no figures being reported over the weekend.  In light of the new cases announced by the UK  Health  Security Agency, they said: \"The risk to the UK population remains low, but we are asking people to be alert to any new rashes or lesions, which would appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body.   \"Although this advice applies to everyone, the majority of the cases identified to date have been among men who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these people in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner.   \"You should call  NHS  111 or a sexual health centre immediately if you have a rash with blisters and either:  \"You have been in close contact with someone who has or might have Monkeypox (even if they have not been tested yet) in the past 3 week. \"You have been to west or central Africa in the past 3 weeks, or you are a man who has sex with men.\" The new cases come amid fresh guidance from UK health chiefs which advise anyone with monkeypox to abstain from sex. The UK Health Security Agency released new guidance today that advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately. They should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before partaking once more.. The guidance comes because the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact, meaning sex could pose as a hotbed for spreading it. May so far as seen over 300 suspected and confirmed cases of monkeypox in Europe. It comes amid warnings from the World health Organisation that the current number of cases could just be the “peak of the iceberg”.  Earlier this month, Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  warned of rising cases but maintained that the vast majority were mild.  Alongside that he said that the UK was stocking up on further doses of vaccines that are effective against the virus. Ahead of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, the UK's top health watchdog warned the public to take caution when taking part in celebration. Health bosses also issued a covid reminder to those heading to parties and using public transport. Monkeypox is not a new virus, and has long been found in central and western Africa. It has been considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo since it first appeared in the 1970s. So far, there have been no reported fatalities from the virus. Speaking prior to the weekend at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: \"We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said. However, the expert added it is \"not a disease the general public should be worried about\". \"It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.\" In recent weeks, the virus has been identified in several countries across Britain and the west, including Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. The UKHSA says: “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals. \"The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.”  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: \"We anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with  NHS  services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals.  “We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. “Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. \"We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. “We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-monkeypox-cases-soar-71-27103545"},

The new cases, as of May 26, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 101. There are also three confirmed cases in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as \"significant and concerning\". The body has issued symptoms to look out for and says the risk to the wider population remains low. On Thursday, the number of monkeypox cases rose by seven, while seven were reported the previous day.  The latest figures come as a health expert warns that  NHS  111 is being overloaded with calls from people with rashes who are worried they have the disease.  Mateo Prochazka, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), encouraged people to contact sexual health clinics instead to ease pressure on the non-emergency service, reports  The Telegraph .  The agency had earlier advised those with symptoms of the disease, such as a rash or swollen lymph nodes, to phone 111 or visit a nearby sexual health clinic. Mr Prochazka said during a webinar advertised on Grindr: “Anyone can be seen in a sexual health clinic regardless of gender, sexual orientation or identity. Everyone is welcome. “There are other potential routes of trying to get yourself into the system, maybe calling NHS 111, but this resource has been really overloaded with everyone calling who had a rash. \"We are trying to point people towards sexual health clinics.” UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days. UKHSA has also purchased over 20,000 additional doses of a safe smallpox vaccine called Imvanex (supplied by Bavarian Nordic) and this is being offered to identified close contacts of those diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at the UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body. If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” The virus is usually found in west and central Africa. Symptoms are generally mild and the illness is spread through close contact with someone already infected, and most people recover within a few weeks. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Meanwhile, a study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared. The research looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-monkeypox-cases-hit-27084679"},

It comes amid warnings from the World health Organisation that the current number of cases could just be the “peak of the iceberg”.  Earlier this month, Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  warned of rising cases but maintained that the vast majority were mild.  Alongside that he said that the UK was stocking up on further doses of vaccines that are effective against the virus. Ahead of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this weekend, the UK's top health watchdog warned the public to take caution when taking part in celebration. Health bosses also issued a covid reminder to those heading to parties and using public transport. Monkeypox is not a new virus, and has long been found in central and western Africa.

Health bosses also issued a  coronavirus  reminder for those planning to use public transport over the long weekend. The first national case of  monkeypox  was discovered May 7, with the following rapid increase in cases causing the UK Health Security Agency to issue a warning that the spread was \" significant and concerning \", with a particular note of caution for gay and bisexual men. Men who have sex with men have been identified by doctors as one of the \"notable\" groups among which the disease has spread. This growing infectious illness has  chickenpox-like symptoms , with painful red rashes as well as similar symptoms to flu or fever. While infections can last up to a month, the illness is usually mild and will pass without further treatment. Anyone who has pox symptoms like a rash or lesion is advised to contact 111 before heading into a GP's office or sexual health clinic. Want to get the latest health news direct to your inbox? Sign up for the Mirror Health newsletter  HERE Dr Charlotte Bigland, Consultant in Health Protection at UKHSA South West said: “While fewer people are wearing masks, it’s still advisable to wear one if you are indoors or if you are mixing with lots of people or on public transport.  \"Washing your hands frequently and ensuring you cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing can prevent the spread of  COVID-19 , as well as lots of other common infections. The best protection against COVID-19 is to get fully vaccinated.  “Monkeypox is also circulating nationally and internationally, so it’s important to for people to stay vigilant. There has been a notable number of cases identified among people who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact 111 or their local sexual health service for advice. If you think you might have Monkeypox, please phone ahead before attending a healthcare setting in person so we can ensure a good clinical experience.” Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This \"incubation period\" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss.

{"title": "Monkeypox patients warned to stop having sex and use condoms for eight weeks after virus", "author": "Kieren Williams", "date": "18:29, 30 May 2022", "text": " Health chiefs have warned  monkeypox  patients to stop having sex amid concerns it could help spread the virus.  In fresh guidance released today, the UK’s top public health agencies called for new measures to manage transmission of the disease. This included telling anyone who has monkeypox to stop having sex whilst they have the virus. However, the health chiefs didn’t stop there and wanted Brits to continue to keep an eye on their sex life for up to eight weeks after, advising any patients to wear a condom over that period during any sexual activities.  The fresh guidance was agreed by the UK’s four public health agencies: the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW) and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland (PHA).  They said: “Cases should abstain from sex during the period of early symptom onset and avoid contact with any lesions. “Whilst there is currently no available evidence of monkeypox in genital excretions, as a precaution, cases are advised to use condoms for 8 weeks after infection and this guidance will be updated as evidence emerges.” Prior to this, they stressed that monkeypox was spread through physical contact, especially through the sufferers lesions and scabs. They added: “People with monkeypox should avoid contact with other people until their lesions have healed and the scabs have dried off. “Cases can reduce the risk of transmission by following standard cleaning and disinfection methods and washing their own clothing and bed linen with standard detergents in a washing machine.” Alongside this, the health bosses said that as well as avoiding sex, people with monkeypox should isolate at home if they are well enough. This week, the UKHSA announced it has bought more than 20,000 doses of a smallpox vaccine that works against monkeypox. Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor and monkeypox Strategic Response Director, at UKHSA said: “This new monkeypox guidance sets out important measures for healthcare professionals and the public for managing the disease including how to safely isolate at home and reduce the risk to others.  “The highest risk of transmission is through direct contact with someone with monkeypox. The risk to the UK population remains low and anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service.”  This all comes after the World Health Organisation warned current case rates might only be the “peak of the iceberg”. Speaking prior to the weekend at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: \"We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said.

Pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said there could be \"many more cases\" that have gone undetected in certain communities. The first UK cases were flagged up on May 7. WHO has now received reports of 257 confirmed cases and around 120 suspected ones across 23 countries, it said in an update on Sunday. There has been no reported fatalities so far. Speaking at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, Ms Briand said: \"We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities.   Have you contracted monkeypox? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk   “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event.\" “We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said. However, the expert added it is \"not a disease the general public should worried about\". \"It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.\" As part of its update yesterday, WHO said the virus constitutes a \"moderate risk\" to overall public health, despite cases being reported in nations the disease is not typically found. It said: \"The public health risk could become high if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a human pathogen and spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease such as young children and immunosuppressed persons.\" WHO also said that the sudden appearance of monkeypox at once in several non-endemic countries suggests undetected transmission for some time and recent amplifying events. The agency added that it expects more cases to be reported as surveillance in endemic and non-endemic countries expands. Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through measures such as self-isolation and hygiene. Most of the cases reported so far have been detected in the UK, Spain and Portugal. \"The vast majority of reported cases so far have no established travel links to an endemic area and have presented through primary care or sexual health services,\" the U.N. agency said.

The sudden rise in cases has baffled experts, who are unsure if infected people who are not displaying symptoms can transmit the disease. Monkeypox is usually mild illness that spreads through close contact and can cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions. More than 300 suspected and confirmed cases of the disease have been reported in May, mostly in Europe. The WHO is considering whether the outbreak, should be assessed as a \"potential public health emergency of international concern\" or PHEIC.  Such a declaration, as was done for  COVID-19  and Ebola, would help accelerate research and funding to contain the disease.  Rosamund Lewis, technical lead for monkeypox from the WHO Health Emergencies Programme was asked if it had the potential grow into pandemic. She said: \"We don't know but we don't think so. \"At the moment, we are not concerned of a global pandemic.\" Once the disease has been contracted, the time between a rash emerging and scabs falling off is recognised as the infectious period. But there is limited information on whether there is any spread of the virus by people who are not symptomatic, Ms Lewis added. \"We really don't actually yet know whether there's a symptomatic transmission of monkeypox - the indications in the past have been that this is not a major feature - but this remains to be determined\", she said. The strain of virus implicated in the outbreak is understood to kill a small fraction of those infected, but no deaths have been reported so far. Most cases have cropped up in Europe rather than in the Central and West African countries where the virus is endemic and are predominantly not linked to travel. Scientists are therefore looking into what might explain this unusual surge of cases, while public health authorities suspect there is some degree of community transmission. Some countries have begun to offer vaccines to close contacts of confirmed cases.

The latest cases, as of May 25, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 85. There are three confirmed cases in Scotland - two of which involve people who recently travelled abroad, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as \"significant and concerning\". The body has issued symptoms to look out for and says the risk to the wider population remains low. On Wednesday, the number of monkeypox cases rose by seven, while 14 were reported the previous day. The latest figures come as the virus spreads to two new areas of the UK, with the first case being confirmed in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland reported to be hospitalised with the disease. Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. “Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks.  “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact  NHS  111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.”  UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days. UKHSA has also purchased over 20,000 additional doses of a safe smallpox vaccine called Imvanex (supplied by Bavarian Nordic) and this is being offered to identified close contacts of those diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. The virus is usually found in west and central Africa. Symptoms are generally mild and the illness is spread through close contact with someone already infected, and most people recover within a few weeks. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness.  It follows a study being published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, pouring cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared.  The research looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-monkeypox-cases-rise-27074061"},

They have even gone so far as to recommending that household rodents – as these are the most susceptible to the disease – such as mice, guinea pigs, hamsters and gerbils should be isolated in government laboratories or even culled. Culling has been deemed a last-resort measure, where monitored isolation and regular testing is impractical, although it has been mooted as a way of halting the disease’s progress in regions affected. “Rodent pets should ideally be isolated in monitored facilities, complying with respiratory isolation (eg. a laboratory) and animal welfare conditions (e.g. government facilities, kennels or animal welfare organisations), and tested (by PCR) for exposure before quarantine ends,” said the European Centre for Disease Control. “Euthanasia should only be a last resort reserved to situations where testing and/or isolation are not feasible.” There have been 90 reported cases of monkeypox in the UK, 85 of which are in England, while 344 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in more than 20 countries worldwide. While rodents are particularly at risk, other domesticated pets such as dogs and cats should also be kept indoors, although they are less vulnerable to the double-stranded DNA disease which is said to have originated from rodents in west and central Africa, although it was first identified in 1958 by Danish virologist Preben von Magnus in crab-eating macaques monkeys which were being used as lab animals. Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, told the Telegraph: “No cases of monkeypox have ever been suspected or reported in pets in the UK and the risk remains low. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with veterinary and public health colleagues, both in the UK and across the world, to manage the animal health associated risks with monkeypox.” The UK Government is set to publish advice in the coming days, urging monkeypox patients to keep their distance from animals and avoid close contact with them. Professor David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, revealed in the Telegraph that although the threat of monkeypox jumping from humans to pets to wildlife is low, it is a “valid concern”. “Rabbits and mice would be ones to watch, as they’re likely to be kept as pets,” he said. “This virus does have quite a wide host range which is always worrying in terms of potential to establish in a new host species… it would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/monkeypox-patients-pet-hamsters-guinea-27078470"},
{"title": "Monkeypox: How YOU can stay safe and protect yourself as UK cases soar", "author": "Kieren Williams", "date": "13:46, 27 May 2022", "text": "Monkeypox cases continue to rise in the UK , with 90 confirmed cases since the outbreak was first reported on May 7.   The re-emerged virus appears as a chickenpox-like rash but other  symptoms  can prove similar to everyday colds and flus.  The rash usually appears across the face, hands and arms but can spread to the genital area. Monkeypox  is a mild illness that has yet to take a life in the UK in the recent outbreak. The virus is not new, having been endemic in parts of Africa for decades.  Here the Mirror runs through how Brits can stay safe from the virus as cases continue to rise. The World Health Organisation (WHO) first advises people to limit contact with anyone who has suspected or confirmed monkeypox. If contact is unavoidable, any skin rashes or lesions should be covered up and medical masks worn. Skin-to-skin contact should be avoided, especially with the affected areas where there are rashes.  They also recommended people should regularly clean their hands with soap or an alcohol-based rub, something Brits will be used to after the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Alongside that, any clothes, towels, or bedsheets that have been touched by any person with the virus or suspected of having it should immediately be washed and surfaces decontaminated. If any Brits have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with monkeypox, they should isolate themselves and seek help by calling 111.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant  NHS  services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms.  “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” The WHO said there is not thought to be much of a risk of monkeypox spreading like Covid did, because it requires close physical contact with someone who is infectious. A vaccine for the re-emerging virus does exist and health chiefs in the country recently snapped up 20,000 doses. A smallpox vaccine called Imvanex has been supplied by Bavarian Nordic to help contain any spread. However, it isn’t freely available for anyone, and will only be selectively distributed to those in more immediate need of it. As things stand, anyone who has been in contact with someone with monkeypox will be given a dose. And anyone who does have the bug has been advised to isolate. The UKHSA compiled a list of monkeypox symptoms that Brits should keep an eye on and be aware of to make sure they stay safe. The signs may include: Fever Headache Muscle aches Backache Chills Exhaustion Night sweats Cold-like symptoms, such as congestion and runny nose Swollen lymph nodes Swollen groin Rash Complications of the illness were documented as: Low mood Severe pain Conjunctivitis However, monkeypox is usually a very mild illness and people tend to recover in two to four weeks. In some rare cases if a person becomes seriously unwell they may require hospital treatment.

It does not usually spread easily between people, but can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. The illness has spread across the UK with a first case recorded in Scotland on May 23.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet.

Dr Anthony Renshaw - who has overseen projects across the world as Regional Medical Director of the EMEA region at  International SOS  - says the virus is \"behaving in a slightly unusual way\" compared to  outbreaks  seen in countries where the disease originated like the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC].  Since May 13, an unprecedented number of cases have been recorded outside of origin countries - with the World Health Organisation now asking world leaders to observe the disease watch how it develops. Cases of monkeypox in the UK were very rare up until this recent outbreak - but the virus could pose a serious threat if it takes hold and spreads through the animal population. The infection is currently thought to be transmitted through \"respiratory droplets\" that people spread when engaging in face-to-face contact, touching or even by sharing bedding. Dr Renshaw told the Mirror: \"If it were to become established in animals here, because then it would become an endemic virus and we'd periodically have outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. \"If it becomes transmitted in a different way, that could potentially change things.\" On Wednesday, pet owners with monkeypox were warned to avoid close contact with animals over fears the virus could spread to them cause irreparable damage to wildlife. The disease - which causes a mild illness, fever and a facial rash that can spread across the body if left untreated - was first detected in a colony of monkeys in the modern-day DRC in 1958, with the first human case recorded in 1970. The WHO has now logged at least 237 confirmed monkeypox cases across the world in countries including the UK, Spain, Portugal and Canada. Dr Renshaw said the disease is \"behaving in a slightly unusual way\" due to spreading between humans with greater ease than it ever has before and because it has emerged in \"countries where it's not normally found\". The doctor said this outbreak has been \"really distinguished\" by \"human to human spread\". \"And human to human spread is thought to be through large respiratory droplets when someone coughs and laughs or sneezes,\" he added. While Dr Renshaw urged caution, he said the disease is not like Covid which is transmitted rapidly from human to human. There is a still a lot of research to be done to learn why the current monkeypox outbreak is spreading so easily among people, he added - but the virus isn't thought to be sexually transmitted. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. Dr Renshaw explained: \"People who identify as being men who have sex with men or bisexual men it’s important that they in particular are mindful of the symptoms and how to prevent being infected - but really everybody should be aware because it doesn’t just affect that group.\" The doctor added the \"very old disease\" was not seen in those communities in earlier outbreaks. He said: \"It's not confined to this group, it's being seen in other groups. \"And with the monkeypox outbreaks we've seen in Nigeria and the DRC and other countries, it's not been spread in that way.\" It comes as health authorities confirmed another eight people have been infected in England, lifting the total number of cases in the UK to 90. The first case of the virus was confirmed yesterday in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland is reported to be in hospital with monkeypox. People with unusual rashes or lesions, particularly if they have had a new sexual partner, have been urged to limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health clinic. Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population \"remains low\". Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. \"To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. “Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks.  “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact  NHS  111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.

{"title": "How contagious is monkeypox? Expert says patients can spread for up to 4 weeks", "author": "Benjamin Lynch", "date": "14:19, 26 May 2022", "text": "Cases of monkeypox  can be  infectious for a long time,  according to scientists working on controlling the disease.  The virus is still spreading with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reporting that there were 79 cases reported as of May 24 this week.  The first  cases of the virus in Northern Ireland and Wales have also now been identified , while Scotland already confirmed one case on Monday.   It's important to be aware of the virus in order to limit the spread, though symptoms are usually mild and the  smallpox vaccine  is already reported to be 85% effective against it.   The UKHSA said: \"Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service\"   Some are wondering  how contagious the virus  is as scientists have now said the virus can spread for up to four weeks.  Reports suggest that monkeypox can be spread for up to four weeks after infection in some cases thanks to the skin lesions that come with the disease. One study suggested some patients could be infectious for up to 10 weeks. The chickenpox-like blisters are reportedly contagious until they have gone according to one expert. Gay and bisexual men appear to have been disproportionately affected and people are being warned about sexual contact and \"close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox\". This includes things like bedding and clothes. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explained that people are not contagious during the virus' incubation period which can last from five to 21 days, but averages between seven and 14 days. Health expert at Southampton University Dr Michael Head told the Mail: \"Based on previous monkeypox outbreaks and guidance from [UK health authorities] and WHO, the infectious period (i.e. when the virus can be transmitted to another person) can be comparable to the time period where the rash and blisters are present. This may be for two weeks, and may be longer. \"Specifically here in this outbreak, we’re learning more about the cases and their presentations, and so many basic questions about their epidemiology are still to be clarified.\" High-risk contacts of people with confirmed cases are being advised to isolate for up to 21 days. It is not yet known fully why the virus is spreading much more than it normally does - it is usually found in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo - and if it will soon be more easily spread. Scientists are working hard to try and make sure they keep on top of the virus. Dr Head said: \"If onward transmission can indeed take place over a longer period of time, early identification of any possible cases is going to be vital in efforts to break those chains of transmission and contain the outbreak.\" UKHSA warned anyone who suspects they may have the virus should take appropriate action. The health body's Chief Medical Adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said: \"We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and NHS services. \"If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible – though please phone ahead before attending in person.

Dr Bayoumy of Coventry University began by reassuring that  monkeypox is not another Covid .  “The spread of monkeypox from infected individuals to another person is through prolonged contact,\" he told us. “This is via mucous membranes, lesions, open cuts or wounds or certain materials such as bedding, towels or clothes.” Discussing the history of the disease, Dr Bayoumy revealed that the virus never began with monkeys, but rather in rodents. He explained it was later called monkeypox when it was isolated in a lab on monkeys, and that's how the name came about. In short, pet owners have little to worry about as it's unlikely you could pass on the monkeypox infection to your cats and dogs. “Since [monkeypox was first recorded], there have been periodic outbreaks of the disease in Africa and in USA in 2003,\" said the expert.  “In the case of the American outbreak, infected prairie  dogs  and squirrels were the cause with experts still unsure as to how the squirrels were originally infected.”   But infection among pet dogs and  cats  is unlikely.  “We need more monitoring but for now there have been no reported cases of dogs or cats being infected,” he added. “Big rodents can be susceptible to monkeypox, however.” When asked why some animals may be more susceptible to others, Dr Bayoumy said: “The disease requires specific receptors found in certain animals organisms making them either more or less susceptible.”  Dr Bayoumy warned those most at risk of monkeypox include children and younger people, healthcare workers or those with compromised immune systems, such as those   living with HIV .  “Fatality for monkeypox is around 3-6% and may be higher among children,\" the virologist explained. “Children’s immune system has not been exposed to viruses and they have a weaker immune system. “Also, people aged under 40 years may not have been vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine when younger, making them more at risk.” Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 after a vaccine programme run by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The vaccine was stopped after smallpox was declared extinct. Dr Bayoumy said: “From 0 to five days a person will experience fever, headache, muscle ache and swollen lymph nodes. “Skin eruption will occur within one to three days after the fever.” Dr Bayoumy stressed that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted virus and can be spread through prolonged contact, which doesn’t always mean sexual contact. For those concerned about any pet animals, PetMD.com recommends keeping kennels clean and hygienic at all times. The site also says to clean your dog regularly and to stop your dog coming into contact with faeces. Public Health England recommends keeping away from pets when self-isolating and to wash your hands in between any contact.

{"title": "Monkeypox outbreak: Covid-like tracker being made to monitor spread as 90 cases hit UK", "author": "Liam Buckler", "date": "18:24, 26 May 2022", "text": " A Covid-like tracker is being developed to help monitor the spread of  monkeypox  - as 90 cases have now been confirmed in the UK.   The  UK Health Security Agency  has already been releasing daily updates on the number of the cases through press releases.  However, UK Health officials are now reportedly working on a Covid-like dashboard in order to keep the public updated with new cases, according to The Express. It took health authorities several weeks to develop the Covid-dashboard which was launched in Spring 2020. The virus was already in circulation across the country when the dashboard was launched. However, the Covid dashboard has been an essential part of the UK's response to the pandemic as it can help monitor and track the virus across the country. A tracking dashboard for monkeypox was quickly set up by the UKHSA to help study the virus and inform the public of rising cases. Over the coming days health officials will offer official guidance on what to do if people develop symptoms of monkeypox and if they believe they have been exposed to the virus. Monkeypox is usually found in Central and Western Africa and can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets. People who are infected right now are sent to quarantine, either at home or in a specialist infectious disease ward in a hospital, after a PCR test confirms the infection. Health officials then track down close contacts and offer them shots of a vaccine that can prevent infection if administered a few days after being exposed. The UK currently has about 23,000 doses of the Bavarian Nordic Imvanex jab, which is specifically designed to combat smallpox, but has also shown to be effective against monkeypox. Each dose of the vaccine costs around £5, with a total of two doses required four weeks apart to ensure maximum protection. The vaccine needs to be given soon after being exposed to the virus in order to alter the infection. As monkeypox has a three-week incubation period, by the time a person is symptomatic, the vaccine is ineffective. Health officials believe the best way to treat the virus is to vaccinate the close contacts of the people who have detected positive for monkeypox.

A further 14 additional cases were confirmed in England and Scotland bringing the total number of cases since May 7 to 71. The UK Health Security Agency, who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as \"significant and concerning\". The body said the risk to the wider population at this stage remains low.  Yesterday, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus.  It does not usually spread easily between people, but can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. The illness has spread across the UK with a first case recorded in Scotland on May 23.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet. It is spread by close contact.  The virus is usually mild but can be more serious in kids and the vulnerable.  Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, is being urged to immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service.  A notable number of cases have been gay and bisexual men, so UKHSA have warned this community to be particularly alert to the symptoms. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said:“We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-monkeypox-cases-rise-25-27053803"},
{"title": "Warning to pet owners as Monkeypox 'could become endemic' if it spreads to animals", "author": null, "date": "15:22, 24 May 2022", "text": " If pets begin catching  monkeypox  the virus could turn into an endemic and could become a permanent issue in the UK,  health  officials have warned.  According to Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), monkeypox is spreading in the UK with 57 cases now recorded. The agency announced on Monday that 36 new infections in England added to the 20 previously known patients, as well as one in Scotland. Ensuring pets are not infected is key to keeping control of the disease which can cause patients to suffer from fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion and chills. No pets are known to have been infected yet. However, the European Centre for Disease Control warned on Monday that it was important to \"manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife\". The update said: \"If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. \"Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. \"Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low.\" The likes of rats, squirrels are likely to be susceptible to catching monkeypox but there are also fears that even dogs and cats could get it. Prof David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, told the Telegraph: \"It would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with.\" Gay and bisexual men have been urged to regularly check for monkeypox-looking rashes or lesions on their body as they make up a \"notable proportion\" of the current cases.  Monkeypox symptoms include an unusual blemish, especially on genitalia which must be immediately reported to  NHS  111 or checked out at the patient's local sexual health clinic.  Once someone has caught monkeypox, they are considered infectious until all their scabs have dropped off - which can take several weeks. Anyone in the UK who has been in close contact with an infected person can receive a smallpox jab called Imvanex to protect them against the disease. The virus gets its name from crab-eating laboratory macaque monkeys in 1958, who were observed to have developed pox. Then 12 years later in 1970, the first human case of monkeypox was detected in Democratic Republic of Congo. Rather than monkeys spreading the disease, it is rodents as seen in the 2003 US outbreak, which was traced back to imported rodents from Ghana. According to the World Health Organisation, the case fatality rate of the milder strain that has spread globally, is around 3-6%. This is compared to the more serious strain known to have a fatality rate of 10%.

The first case of the virus has been confirmed in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland is reported to be in hospital with monkeypox. Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately.  \"To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. “Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact  NHS  111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.” There are now believed to be 80 cases of monkeypox in the UK. The UKHSA will update the totals later today. Their last update stated that 77 cases were in England and one in Scotland.  Now there are also one in Northern Ireland and one in Wales too. Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population “remains low”. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness. The news comes as a study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared.  The Lancet report looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.”  Earlier this week, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus.

It follows the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) having stated that the virus has the potential to spread to pets and then into nature. Seven more cases of monkeypox have been identified in England, in latest figures from health officials. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the new cases bring the UK total since May 7 to 78. Among these cases, 77 were identified in England and one case has been reported in Scotland. As of May 24, no cases had been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland.  People with unusual rashes or lesions, particularly if they have had a new sexual partner, have been urged to contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health clinic.  But health officials stressed people should phone ahead before attending in person. Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, backed the advice of people taking care with their pets.  \"It would be a sensible decision to keep your distance from a pet while in quarantine,’ she told the  Daily Mail. \"If I was diagnosed with monkeypox I would do whatever I could to limit contact, such as asking a friend or relative to take care of it.\" She added: ‘There is currently no evidence of transmission between humans and cats and dogs but we know rabbits and rodents are susceptible.

This is the first time there has been an international  spread  on such a large scale.  The virus first originated in 1970 in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo and is endemic in parts of Africa.  As of May 21, there were nearly 100 confirmed cases across the world with the highest recorded by any country in the  UK , at 56.  Denmark yesterday became the latest country to confirm cases. There have been no deaths so far and while the spread is alarming as it is new and unknown, health officials have said not to worry.  Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable  disease control  and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, told The Mirror: \"This will be limited and generate a few clusters and then it will go away.  \"My expert and the considered view is that this is not something that will spread as it doesn't go down the aerosol route therefore it is much easier and entirely possible to contain it.\" How is the situation across the rest of the globe? Europe At least 85 cases have been confirmed in eight European countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Spain has been the source of a large spread across Europe, with 30 cases on Sunday all traced to a single superspreader event at a sauna in its capital, Madrid. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and is investigating another 67.  There is also believed to be a case in Spain involving a British tourist. A spokesman for the  Canary Islands’  Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.”  Belgium became the first country to introduce compulsory quarantine, ordering any monkeypox patients to stay home for three weeks. \"The country so far has just four cases, with all but one linked to a festival in Antwerp. French health authorities discovered its first case in the Paris region last week and declared three more cases on Monday. Portugal's health authorities reported 14 new cases on Monday, bringing the total count to 37. Authorities are investigating a festival in Gran Canaria after it was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. The Netherlands declared that “a few cases” had been found on Saturday, while Denmark said on Monday it had its first case in a man who had just returned from Spain.  Brits feared to have  monkeypox  were quarantined in Greece as medics panicked over a rash. They later tested negative for monkeypox.  There are around four confirmed cases in Germany which have been linked to exposure at “party events” including in Berlin. Australia Australia has just two cases, one case in a traveller who had just returned from the United Kingdom, and another likely case in someone who had returned from Europe. USA and Canada On Sunday, authorities in the United States said they may have found a third case of the monkeypox virus and were running tests on a patient in South Florida. The first case was reported in Boston on May 18, followed by another in New York City on May 19. While Canadian public health officials confirmed 5 cases in Quebec and are investigating more elsewhere. West Africa The disease is endemic in a large number of West African countries, meaning it is regularly found in people there. Those countries are Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (animals only), Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan, according to the World Health Organisation. In those countries, there are unsurprisingly a number of cases including 46 in Nigeria, 25 in Cameroon and six in the Central African Republic.

A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service said in a short statement: “A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is unknown if is alone on the island or in a party also being tested.  Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and said another 67 people are being tested. Europe is in a heightened state of alert for the rare condition  which causes symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Last week Spain reported a number of infections, mainly in the Madrid region where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. A Gran Canaria pride festival attended by 80,000 people from Britain and other European countries is also being probed. Health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero added at the time: “The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis... to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible.” Most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment. Yesterday it was confirmed the number of monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 57, according to the UK Health Security Agency. On Friday, there were 20 cases in England and that figure was expected to climb, with a further 36 now confirmed. Scotland also recorded its first case , taking the total to 57. Dr Nick Phin, the medical and public health science director at Public Health Scotland, said the infected individual is \"being managed and treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance\". Monkeypox is rarely passed between people but can be via close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has the virus, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. A large proportion of cases identified in men who have sex with other men communities. It is not normally a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.

A study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are no longer contagious once their lesions have disappeared. The Lancet report looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa.

Dr David Porter, a paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s  NHS  Foundation Trust, admitted that cases in the UK were rare.  He said: “As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don’t think parents should be worried about this being monkeypox at this stage, because we’re seeing a very low number of cases. “And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we’ve seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it’s been predominantly in adults.” The study also suggests that some antiviral medications might have the potential to shorten symptoms and reduce the amount of time a patient is contagious. The cases analysed represent the first instances of in-hospital transmission and household transmission outside of Africa, as well as reporting the patient response to the first off-label use of two different antiviral medications – brincidofovir and tecovirimat (drugs designed to target smallpox) – to treat the disease. The report found little evidence that brincidofovir was of clinical benefit, but did conclude that further research into the potential of tecovirimat would be warranted. The study did not look at the current outbreak in Britain, with the majority of the 71 cases catching it in the community, and a sizeable proportion in gay and bisexual men. Dr Nick Price, of Guy’s & St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, a senior author on the paper, added: “Until now, monkeypox has been a rare, imported condition in the UK and the NHS High Consequence Infectious Diseases Network has treated all seven of the UK’s confirmed cases until 2021. “Outbreaks outside of Africa are unusual but in recent days, significant outbreaks have been reported in several European countries, including the UK, and further afield globally. “Clinical trial data is lacking and we are pleased to share some of our collective experience in managing this previously rare and sporadic condition.”   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-remains-infectious-long-after-27057145"},

Since then, there have been more than 80 cases in at least 12 countries. The disease causes a distinctive rash on the body that shares similarities with shingles.  As with monkeypox,  shingles symptoms  prior to a rash include weakness, chills and muscle aches.  Some people also develop pain, itching, tingling, and burning on the skin before the rash appears. There are some key similarities between monkeypox and shingles that may cause concern for many. Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic disease - meaning it’s caused by germs that spread between animals and people. The virus transmits via large droplets that can only travel a short distance, but it can also be spread through direct contact with skin lesions or, sometimes, contaminated bedsheets or clothes. A monkeypox rash usually appears one to five days after the first symptoms. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body. Monkeypox is synonymous with a rash which can appear on the:  Shingles is a painful condition caused by the same virus that causes  chickenpox .   According to the  NHS , anyone can get it, but it's most common in older people.  In fact, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) warns that \"one in three adults\" will go to develop shingles during their life. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, about 50% of people who live to age 85 will develop shingles at some point in their life. Shingles is a viral infection which as with monkeypox, causes a painful rash. The symptoms of shingles include:  “Shingles can sometimes be mistaken for another skin conditions, such as hives, psoriasis, or  eczema ,” says Medical News Today.  The health site added: “At first, the shingles rash appears as small, raised dots. “One difference between shingles and other rashes is the pattern that develops. The shingles rash often develops in a pattern along the nerves of the chest and belly.” The site added that the best way to know for sure if it is shingles or something more serious such as monkeypox is to speak with your GP. “In most cases, a doctor can make a diagnosis based on medical history, a physical exam, and symptoms,” it added.

They later tested negative for monkeypox which has now been found in several European countries - but positive for harmless chickenpox. It comes as Greece enters a heightened state of alert for the rare condition which causes symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. It is usually contained to countries in Africa. A statement from Norwegian firm EpiGuard- who are experts in medical isolation and transportation- confirmed its plane landed at Kefalonia airport to pick up two British tourists diagnosed with symptoms reminiscent of monkeypox. They said: “Shortly after 11pm Saturday, May 21, the Hellenic Air Force’s C-130 Hercules landed at Kefalonia airport to pick up two British tourists diagnosed with symptoms reminiscent of monkeypox. “On a day-to-day basis the EpiShuttle is used to transport patients with suspicion of covid, ebola, measles, tuberculosis, and now also monkeypox, across the globe. “The EpiShuttle can isolate any contagious patient, regardless of disease, and efficiently protect the staff and society at large.” Latest updates suggest monkeypox is spread via very close contact such as sex with most of the initial cases detected among homosexual men. Earlier today Public Health Scotland confirmed its first case in the country.  Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland's Director of Public Health Science, said: “We are working with  NHS  Boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.  “Close contacts of the case are being identified and provided with health information and advice.” There have now been 20 confirmed cases in the UK. Downing Street has moved to reassure the public the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is monitoring monkeypox \"extremely carefully\". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"We have the UK Health Security Agency who are monitoring this extremely carefully. \"The facts we know is that monkeypox is not usually spread easily between people, and the risk to others remains low. \"A notable portion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men, so the UKHSA is urging this community in particular to be alert. \"It's true to say that most people recover within a few weeks.\"  Over the weekend an expert warned the    monkeypox    outbreak has reached epidemic proportions.   The    World Health Organisation    (WHO) is holding daily meetings to keep up to date with the latest on the new health threat.  Fabian Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute, described the current outbreak as an epidemic. He reassured: “However, it is very unlikely this epidemic will last long.

Dr Ranj Singh says '  hysteria' has been created and is growing concerned after it the outbreak was compared to  HIV  online.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have alerted men that monkeypox appears to be spreading in the  LGBT+  community globally.  The organisation's Dr John Brooks emphasised that anyone can contract Monkeypox, through close personal contact regardless of sexual orientation. But he went on to say many of the people affected across the world so far are men who identify as gay or bisexual. Britain has recorded 57 cases so far, the UK Health and Security Agency, with new infections are being found \"daily\". Dr Ranj Singh wants to stop discussion about Monkeypox being  'the gay disease’ and says it is simply inaccurate to liken it to HIV.   He wrote in gay bible  Attitude Magazine  : \"We know that it spreads through close contact - it’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of men who have sex with men, who may have multiple intimate contacts, has allowed more rapid spread.  \"We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean men who have sex with men are at fault at all. \"We definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’.\" Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it can be transmitted through sexual and intimate contact. Dr Brooks said: “We want to help people make the best informed decisions to protect their health and the health of their community from monkeypox.\" The rare virus - which causes a rash and a fever - has been seen around the world in recent weeks. Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee to discuss the issue. Dr Hilary Jones, meanwhile, has warned of an \"unprecedented\" outbreak in monkeypox as he warned of the five symptoms to look out amid the case rise.  He opened up about the rise in cases across the world during a health segment on ITV's  Good Morning Britain  with news correspondent Ranvir Singh.  \"We know it is not a serious infection, usually.

It was claimed the youngster is being treated in a London hospital. Chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said the virus is being spread by community transmission in Britain.  She added: “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis. I’d like to thank all those coming forward for testing   to sexual health clinics, to GPs and emergency departments.”  A total of 20 infections have been confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency ahead of an update today. About 145 cases have been identified outside of Central and West Africa where it is most common. That includes Europe, North America and Australia. The virus is usually mild but can be more serious in kids and the vulnerable.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet. It is spread by close contact.  Dr Hopkins added: “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual.” Asked to confirm reports someone is in intensive care with monkeypox, she said: “We don’t confirm individual reports and individual patients.” The UK is treating contacts of confirmed cases with a smallpox jab that is effective against the virus. Dr Hopkins said: “There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox. \"We’re using a form of smallpox vaccine in individuals at high risk of developing symptoms.” Belgium became the first country to impose a 21-day monkeypox quarantine yesterday after recording three cases linked to a festival in Antwerp. And high-risk contacts of patients in Britain could be required to isolate for three weeks, health chiefs said. The current strain has a fatality rate of about 1%.  It tends to spread only among those with symptoms, making it simpler to control than  coronavirus .  It comes as it was revealed British scientists warned of our vulnerability to monkeypox three years ago, saying it could fill the void left by smallpox.

On Friday, there were 20 cases in England and that figure was expected to climb, with a further 36 now confirmed.  Scotland today also recorded its first case, taking the total to 57. Dr Nick Phin, the medical and public health science director at Public Health Scotland, said the infected individual is \"being managed and treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance\".  Yesterday, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus. It does not usually spread easily between people.  But can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils.  An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, said \"we have never seen anything like this before, with such a number of cases\" in so many countries. However, monkeypox is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. Are you suffering from monkeypox? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk The UKHSA has purchased supplies of a safe smallpox vaccine and this is being offered to identified close contacts of someone diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox or to impose any travel bans. Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service. A notable proportion of cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men and so UKHSA continues to urge this community to be alert to monkeypox symptoms. People should notify clinics ahead of their visit and can be assured their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK.  \"Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact tracing efforts – you are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK.\" Dr Phin went on to describe the risk to the public as low, but warned anyone with \"blister-like sores\" on their body to seek medical attention. PHS did not say where the person was being treated or where they were located but said close contacts were being traced and would be given support, including the possibility of vaccination.  High-risk contacts of  monkeypox  patients are required to isolate for three weeks, guidance from UK health chiefs states.  Others who had a lesser degree of exposure are advised to steer clear of children, people with conditions affecting their immune systems and pregnant women - but are not required to stay home.  Today, a UK Government Minister assured that monkeypox is not a \"repeat of\"  Covid-19 .  Chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News: \"As with any new disease, and obviously after the Covid pandemic doubly so, we continue to monitor this very closely. \"I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. \"There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact. \"That being the case, the risk of community transmission is much lower, we have a working vaccine, if people present with symptoms or have very close contact, then we are advising that they quarantine for three weeks but the threshold for that is quite high - it really does have to be close physical or sexual contact.\" Mr Clarke said he was not aware of reports of a baby being in intensive care with monkeypox, adding: \"What I would say is we are cautious but we are certainly not in a position where I would in any way worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.\" Initial symptoms of the virus include fever or high temperature; head, muscle and backache; swollen lymph nodes; chills and exhaustion. A blister-like rash or a small number of blister-like sores can also develop, starting on the face but spreading across the body. The rash changes throughout the infection, finally forming a scab which falls off within weeks. Those with the virus are infectious between the time that symptoms start and when the last scab falls off.

He reassured: “However, it is very unlikely this epidemic will last long. “The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary.” The WHO held an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the dangers of the rare viral infection. Latest updates suggest it is spread via very close contact such as sex with most of the initial cases detected among homosexual men. Spain reported 24 new cases on Friday, mainly in the Madrid region where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. Health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero added: “The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis... to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible.” A hospital in Israel has also treated a man displaying symptoms consistent with the disease after recently arriving from Western Europe. Most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment. Dr Hans Kluge added: “Anyone who is concerned about an unusual rash should consult their doctor or healthcare provider. “People with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated from the first appearance of symptoms. “The main way it can spread is through close physical contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has monkeypox.” There are fears the summer could create more problems thanks to parties and outdoor festivals. Meanwhile there are fears monkeypox could have a \"massive impact\" on access to sexual health services, a top doctor warned. Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said she is concerned about how the infection could affect services because staff who come in contact with sufferers are forced to isolate.  She told the  BBC  that clinic staff were \"already under significant pressure\" before monkeypox was identified, making the situation worse.  She added: \"It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who's infected. \"In terms of the infection and its consequences for individuals, I'm not that concerned. \"I am concerned about our ability to maintain good sexual health services and access for everyone while still managing this new infection.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-outbreak-biggest-ever-europe-27026882"},

Former Soviet Union bioweapons expert Colonel Kanat Alibekov – otherwise known as Kenneth Alibek - claimed in recently discovered interviews that the country had a programme to work out what viruses could be weaponised. He was deputy head of the USSR’s biological weapons programme until its collapse in 1991.  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which can be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa, and spread between humans via both droplet respiration or an infected person's bodily fluids. It comes as Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  revealed yesterday (Friday) there are now 20 cases currently in the UK.  Dr Alibekov said: \"So we developed a special program to determine what 'model' viruses could be used instead of human smallpox. We tested vaccinia virus, mousepox virus, rabbitpox virus, and monkeypox virus as models for smallpox. \"The idea was that all research and development work would be conducted using these model viruses. Once we obtained a set of positive results, it would take just two weeks to conduct the same manipulations with smallpox virus and to stockpile the warfare agent. We would have in our arsenal a genetically altered smallpox virus that could replace the previous one.\"  The eradication of smallpox through global vaccine programmes forced the Soviets to ditch the idea. Dr Alibekov said in a 1998 interview that stray cases caused by an accidental leak in  Russia  would now be \"difficult to explain to the international community\".   Russian  Ministry of Defence  decided to continue working with monkeypox to \"create future biological weapons\" after the end of the USSR, the doctor added.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has advised  anyone who is at risk of catching the virus should isolate for 21 days , as part of a ramping up of test and trace efforts.  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), those considered high-risk are people who have had face-to-face contact without PPE with someone infected, direct physical or sexual contact, or contact with contaminated materials like clothing or bedding. Isolating people have been told not to travel, to provide UKHSA with their contact details and to avoid people with immune system problems, children under the age of 12 and pregnant women. Over 80 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in at least 12 countries so far, with 20 of them so far detected in England since the start of May.  The  first signs of a monkeypox infection  include a headache, fever and chills, as well as fatigue to the point of exhaustion.  Other reported initial symptoms included muscle aches, backache and swollen lymph nodes. The UKHSA explained the symptoms: \"A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. \"The rash changes and goes through different stages – it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off.\" The health agency reports that the virus appears to be disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual young men. It added: \"The virus spreads through close contact and UKHSA is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or MSM [men who have sex with men], to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns.\" Monkeypox infections tend to clear up slowly, between 14 to 21 days Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UKHSA, said: \"We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally.  \"Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact  NHS  111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns.\"  There is currently absolutely no indication whatsoever there will be a lockdown as a result of monkeypox. A UK Covid lockdown was issued in March 2020 because the virus was easily spread and there was no vaccine at the time, meaning that though most people (except the vulnerable and elderly) did not get serious symptoms, people were forced to isolate in order to protect the NHS and its limited bed spaces. Scientists are now working to understand why monkeypox cases are spreading at an faster than usual rate.  The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Professor Jimmy Whitworth told the  BBC  : \"I don't think the general public need to be worried at this stage, but I don't think we've uncovered all of this and we are not in control of this.\"  Smallpox vaccines are reported to be 85% effective against the virus. Monkeypox cases are very low and although it is not clear why it currently seems to be spreading in Western countries, there is little to no concern it will take hold. Fear around the prospect of a lockdown appears to be due to nervousness thanks to the experiences of people during the Covid pandemic during the last two years.

Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for UKHSA, said updated figures for the weekend will be released on Monday as she warned of more cases \"on a daily basis\". She also warned that doctors are seeing community transmission with cases predominantly being identified in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual or men who have sex with other men.  Speaking to  BBC  One's Morning Show, Dr Hopkins said: \"We will be releasing updated numbers tomorrow - over-the-weekend figures.  \"We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I'd like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department.\" Asked if there is community transmission in the UK, she said: \"Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country. \"The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\" Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: \"That's because of the frequent close contacts they may have. \"We would recommend to anyone who's having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash.\" Asked if people will need to get vaccinated for the infection, she said: \"There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox but we are using a form of smallpox vaccine - a third-generation, smallpox vaccine that's safe in individuals who are contacts of cases. \"So, we're not using it in the general population. \"We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. \"For contacts, (this) reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point.\"  It comes as US president  Joe Biden  said that recent cases of monkeypox which have been identified in Europe and the United States are something \"to be concerned about\".

The infection has been found so far in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Outside of Europe doctors have found cases of the rare viral infection in Australia, Canada and the USA. Because of the geographically dispersed nature of cases, the World Health Organisation fears transmissions may have been spread around for some time. Monkeypox usually arises mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it was first discovered in the 1970s. Dr Hans Kluge said the situation may worsen in the summer months thanks to parties and outdoor festivals. He warned: “As we enter the summer season in the European Region, with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned transmissions could accelerate. “The cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the symptoms are unfamiliar to many. “Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which can be spread from person to person…to date, at least eight countries in the WHO European Region have reported cases in recent day. “These recent cases are atypical for several reasons, firstly because in this instance all but one of the recent cases have no relevant travel history to areas where monkeypox is endemic, in West Africa or Central Africa. “Secondly, because most of the initial cases found are being detected through sexual health services and are among men who have sex with men. “And thirdly, because of the geographically dispersed nature of the cases.” According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Reassuringly, most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment However, the disease can be more severe, especially in young children, pregnant women, and individuals who are immunocompromised. Dr Kluge added: “Anyone who is concerned about an unusual rash should consult their doctor or healthcare provider. “People with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated from the first appearance of symptoms. “The main way it can spread is through close physical contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has monkeypox.” “That these cases are being detected and reported shows that our surveillance systems are working, and I would like to thank the countries concerned for their prompt action and transparent information sharing. “It is crucial that this collaboration continues as the situation evolves further.”  It comes  as the number of UK monkeypox cases doubled in a day  as fears of the disease spreading through communities grow.   Health Secretary    Sajid Javid    said the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had confirmed 11 more cases of monkeypox in the UK, with most being described as mild.

Sign up to our  TeamDogs newsletter  for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.    Following a study into monkeypox in 2013, an extract from the Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, reads: \"Monkeypox is a viral disease discovered in laboratory monkeys in 1958. \"The disease most commonly occurs in central and west Africa. Many animal species and humans can be infected. \"In 2003, monkeypox infected several people in the United States after they had contact with infected prairie dogs. \"The monkeypox virus is closely related to the viruses that cause smallpox and cowpox in humans. \"Old and New World monkeys and apes, a variety of rodents, including rats, mice, squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits, are susceptible to infection. \"The complete range of animal species that can be infected by the monkeypox virus is still not known; other wild and domestic animals may be susceptible.\"  It comes after The Mirror spoke to Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable  disease control  and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, about whether people should be worried.  He told the Mirror: \"It's rare because these outbreaks are often sporadic and confined to West Africa or Central Africa — it happens there and finishes there.\" \"While it is not likely to trigger another Covid-like pandemic, it is probable it will continue to spread. \"Monkeypox is one of those where the mode of transmission is dual, so it can pass between animals or humans,\" he continued. \"As a result of rapid international transport and travel, what happens in one place doesn't stay in one place, but it moves very quickly to another.\" Matthew Ferrari, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University, told the Telegraph that while this may not manifest as a large-scale catastrophe, this is a \"stark reminder that emergence events are not black swans and we must plan accordingly\". Dr Pankhania said: \"We need international disease surveillance, disease management and disease resources because whatever happens in one part of the world, very quickly can become a problem in another part of the world.\" The virus has likely been spreading undetected for some time. \"Someone has either gone on to or returned from West or Central Africa and then in their network of friends passed on the infection while they were incubating it,\" Dr Pankhania said. Some cases have been confirmed as links with travel to the region, but not all, meaning the others caught it domestically.  Bill Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Harvard University, said on  Twitter  : \"Folks don't expect to see monkeypox and so don't diagnose it.  \"On the bright side, this implies that the severity of the infections are not extremely high or we would have noticed sooner. On the gloomier, it means there are multiple transmission chains out there already.\" Monkeypox is related to smallpox with similar symptoms, but with a more severe rash.  Patients usually start with a fever, sore muscles, swollen lymph nodes and  headaches .  Generally, after one to three days, a distinct bumpy rash begins to develop. \"These little boils are affecting not only your epidermis, which is the top layer of your skin, but it is affecting the second layer of your skin too and there is potential for scarring because these pustules can get very itchy,\" Dr Pankhania said.  He added that it's very rare for  smallpox  pustules to lead to secondary scarring, same with chickenpox.  Whereas with monkeypox, it is entirely possible that you could get secondary scarring. He continues: \"This will be limited and generate a few clusters and then it will go away. \"My expert and the considered view is that this is not something that will spread as it doesn't go down the aerosol route therefore it is much easier and entirely possible to contain it.\" In primates, Monkeypox usually appears as a rash that lasts between four to six weeks. It can spread all over the body but is most common in the face, limbs and tail. Whereas rabbits, rodents, and prairie dogs, are more likely to experience a fever, reddened eyes, runny nose, cough, swollen glands, depression, and loss of appetite. The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, states: \"A rash with small swellings, containing pus (pocks), and patchy hair loss can develop. In some animals, pneumonia or death can occur.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-symptoms-animals-virus-spreads-27020576"},
{"title": "UK monkeypox isolation rules explained with 21 day quarantine for those at highest risk", "author": "Dave Burke", "date": "21:43, 22 May 2022", "text": "High risk contacts of  monkeypox  patients are required to isolate for three weeks, guidance from UK health chiefs states. Others who had a lesser degree of exposure are advised to steer clear of children, people with conditions affecting their immune systems and pregnant women - but are not required to stay home. Guidelines  introduced in 2018 state that everyone identified as a contact is assessed on a \"case by case\" basis in order to contain the disease. Those identified as being at risk are divided into three categories, with those in the highest level ordered to quarantine for 21 days. The rules were brought in following cases of monkeypox in 2018, and have not been changed in light of the latest outbreak. Scroll down to see the guidance for each category of contact The UK has confirmed 20 cases of monkeypox in the past fortnight - having previously recorded just seven cases since the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970. Yesterday the World Health Organisation said there were 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases in 12 countries where monkeypox is not endemic. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said that those who come into contact with a monkeypox case are given advice based on their level of exposure. A UKHSA spokesperson said: \"The maximum isolation period for the highest category of contact is 21 days from the point they interacted with someone with monkeypox.  \"However, isolation advice is given on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific exposure circumstances of that individual so will differ among different contacts.\" These are people who have unprotected direct contact or high risk contact with those with monkeypox. For people in this situation, health chiefs advise: The document states that those who fall into this contact are most likely to have had \"household contact\" and \"sexual contact\" with the person with monkeypox. They are likely to have direct exposure to a patient's broken skin, bodily fluid or items such as clothing or bedding without wearing PPE. These are people who have not had contact with broken skin or sores, but may still have had physical contact or who could have contracted the virus through droplets. They include those who have touched with unbroken skin or have been within a metre of someone with monkeypox - such as a person directly next to them on a plane. While they are not required to isolate, health protection teams are required to make daily contact for 21 days after exposure to check if they are showing any symptoms. They are advised not to come into contact with immunocompromised people, pregnant women and children under 12. The guidelines state that they can be excluded from work for three weeks if their job requires contact with anyone who falls into these categories. This group includes people who have had close contact with monkeypox patients while wearing PPE, or those who have been within one and three metres of a case. These includes people sitting within three rows from an infected person on a plane. They are not required to live under any restrictions, but are told to contact their local health protection team if they display any symptoms. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said there is \"absolutely\" community transmission of monkeypox in the UK. She also said cases have been predominantly confirmed in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual. Speaking to  BBC  One's Sunday Morning, she said: \"Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country. \"The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\" Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: \"That's because of the frequent close contacts they may have. \"We would recommend to anyone who's having changes in sex partners regularly or having close contact with individuals that they don't know to come forward if they develop a rash.\" Experts say monkeypox does not spread easily between people. The UKHSA says: \"Spread of monkeypox may occur when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir for transmission to humans), human, or materials contaminated with the virus. Monkeypox has not been detected in animals in the UK. \"The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).\" It said that the main means of person-to-person spread are: Those who become ill usually make a full recovery within four weeks, health officials believe. But the virus can be deadly, and is believed to have a fatality rate of around one per cent. First signs of infection include: A rash usually develops within five days, often starting on the face then spreading across the body. These marks usually turn to scabs, which eventually fall off. UKHSA says: \"An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-monkeypox-isolation-rules-explained-27035233"},

Cases are spreading across Europe and Belgium, which has recorded three cases, has introduced a mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone suffering from the virus. Outbreaks have been reported in Spain, Portugal and central Africa and on Friday Spain reported 23 cases some of which were linked to a sauna in Madrid. An island festival in Spain attended by 80,000 people is is believed the source of cases in Spain and Italy. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed 20 cases of the disease in the UK with nine other countries outside of Central and West Africa also reporting outbreaks. More cases of the disease are being reported every day in the UK, according to Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for UKHSA.  Dr Hopkins said in an interview with the  BBC  that younger children were more at risk.  She said: \"We do know from reports from Africa, where the disease has circulated in outbreaks over many years, certain individuals are much more at risk of severe disease, including immuno-suppressed individuals or young children. \"In adults, it is relatively mild.\" The disease, which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact - including sexual intercourse - and is caused by the monkeypox virus. Medics are still learning about the illness as it is a new disease which has not been circulating in the community. She told the BBC: \"Clearly, this is a new infectious disease that we haven't seen in our community before. \"We will need to learn a lot about it over the coming weeks.\" There were 20 cases of monkeypox on Friday and Dr Hopkins said updated figures for the weekend will be released on Monday as she warned of more cases \"on a daily basis\". She was asked about the risk to those going to summer festivals and kids on holidays abroad. She told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: \"We are detecting more cases on a daily basis. \"We know there's been a period of restrictions across Europe and we don't know where this infection has come from and how it's come into Europe. \"There's no obvious connection in our cases in the UK to a single event.\" \"The risk to the general population remains extremely low,\" she said - but added: \"People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.\" Symptoms include a viral illness, before a rash like chickenpox spreads across the body. Those who feel they have any of these must \"stay at home\", Dr Hopkins said. \"If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic,\" she said. It's believed Covid lockdowns across the world may have fuelled the spread of the virus. \"We know there's been period of restrictions across Europe, and we don't know where infection has come from,\" she said. \"There is no obvious connection to a single event in our cases in the UK.\" Asked if people will need to get vaccinated for the infection, she told BBC One's Sunday Morning: \"There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox but we are using a form of smallpox vaccine - a third-generation smallpox vaccine that's safe in individuals who are contacts of cases. \"So, we're not using it in the general population. \"We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. \"For contacts, [this] reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/monkeypox-travel-warning-brits-told-27032476"},

A second case of the  virus  has been confirmed in a man in New South Wales who also recently travelled back to the country from Europe.  Both men, in their 30s and 40s, are presenting mild symptoms so but ones which are clinically compatible with monkeypox, health officials said. The man in his 30s arrived in Melbourne on Monday, Victoria state's health department said, while the second case was identified in Sydney in a man in his 40s. Dr Kerry Chant, New South Wales' state chief health officer, said a preliminary test in the Sydney man was positive and subsequent testing confirmed the case. She said: \"Just to reassure the community, it is not the same spread mechanism as Covid or flu, where it is more fleeting.\" The Victoria health department said on Friday: “Testing has confirmed that he has the virus and he remains in isolation at the Alfred with mild symptoms.\" Monkeypox usually arises mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it was first discovered in the 1970s. However, in recent weeks, it has been identified in several non-endemic countries in recent weeks, including Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. The UKHSA says: “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals. \"The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Monkeypox is spread through prolonged face-to-face contact with those who are infected with the virus, often through large respiratory droplets. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said state health authorities were closely monitoring the situation, but he believes it to be \"far less contagious\" than Covid and \"things of that nature.\" He continued: “We should be taking this seriously [but] at the same time I would say that no one should be alarmed at this point. We’ve got the best health authorities in the world.” The state’s chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said fatality rates are between 1 and 5 per cent. Canada also reported its first two confirmed cases of monkeypox on Thursday night, with 17 further cases under investigation in Montreal.

London, Lisbon, and Madrid all have either confirmed or said they have suspected monkeypox cases. The UK continues to monitor the emerging virus which is believed to have originated in central and west Africa. As things stand London has six confirmed cases, Lisbon has five confirmed cases but a suspected 15 more and today officials in Madrid announced that they were investigating eight suspected cases. A spokesperson for Madrid’s regional health department confirmed the cases were suspected as monkeypox and being analysed to confirm a diagnosis. They said: “Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the eight suspected cases point towards fluid contact. “The eight suspected cases in Madrid are among men who have sex with men. They are doing well but this illness can require hospital treatment.” They added that a nationwide alert had been issued. Lisbon was one of two regions in Portugal with a monkeypox outbreak, along with the Tagus Valley. Portuguese authorities confirmed the cases today and said that all the men involved symptoms that included ulcerative lesions. A spokesperson for them said that similar to the UK the infected men had cases of ulcerative lesions and that they were monitoring the situation at a national level and in conjunction with European institutions. Prior to this recent spread in infections, monkeypox had only ever been detected in four countries outside of Africa, the UK, US, Israel and Singapore. And all of these cases had travel links back to Nigeria and Ghana. Similar to what was reported in Spain, the UK Health Security Agency said that all four men with the most recent cases identified as gay or bisexual and had sex with other men. UK health chiefs said the risk to the general population was low. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. “We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” Mateo Prochazka, an STI expert and head of UKHSA team investigating the outbreak, said that the pattern of spread is “highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks”.

{"title": "Is there a monkeypox vaccine? What are the symptoms and who is eligible for jab?", "author": "Christian Abbott", "date": "10:32, 19 May 2022", "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has just declared a  global health emergency in the wake of monkeypox's continued spread .  It has a  lower transmission rate  than that of  Covid-19 , but can be spread through close contact with an infected person.  It's also harder to catch than Covid, but the  NHS  is still warning people to report early signs of infection.  Typically, there is a one- to two-week window after first contact before symptoms start to show, though this is sometimes as late as three weeks. It has led to the hope that a vaccine is on the way to stop the spread quickly and effectively. There is good news, but the UK is far behind in the process. Yes, there is a monkeypox vaccine and it is available in the UK. The NHS is ramping up the rollout of doses, though there is still a limited supply, currently.  It is known as Jynneos by Bavarian Nordic, a vaccine that targets smallpox and monkeypox alike, which has just been given the nod in the EU. Jynneos is based on a live, attenuated vaccinia virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA-BN), which is incapable of replicating in the human body but able to jumpstart an immune response. The smallpox vaccination is being offered to those most at risk of contracting the virus, including those who have already been in close contact, some healthcare workers, and some men who have sex with men. Those who are eligible for the jab will be contacted by the NHS. The first dose of the vaccine could help reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent future infections. Some people may be offered a second dose, too. Steve Russell, NHS Director of Vaccinations, said: “While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. “On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London, and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible. “The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice. “Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected. “We will be inviting anyone who we believe is a priority for vaccination and local teams will be working to make sure that anyone who meets the criteria set by UKHSA knows how they can get their jab. “We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are seven main symptoms of monkeypox. The symptoms are: The CDC explains: \"In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. \"Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. “The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. “The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually seven to 14 days but can range from five to 21 days.\" As of July 20 2022, there were 2,162 laboratory confirmed cases in the UK. The vast majority of these cases are found in England, though it has also been detected in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.   According to the  government website , cases have been predominantly found in gay and bisexual people and men who have sex with men (MSM).  \"The virus spreads through close contact and UKHSA is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or MSM, to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns,\" says the government.

UKHSA experts are contacting the infected person's colleagues to give health tips and advice, but insist this is only a \"precautionary measure\". Dr Nicholas Price, director of the unit, said: \"The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas’ Hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.\"  In the wake of the  Covid  pandemic, alerts of little-known diseases like monkeypox can seem alarming, but the boffins caring for the patient have insisted the overall risk to the general public is very low.  Monkeypox is a viral infection first discovered in 1958, known for occurring more commonly in monkeys. In 1958, two outbreaks were recorded in colonies of monkeys kept for research, but the first human case was not recorded until 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Colin Brown of the UKHSA said: \"It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.\" The UKHSA described the disease as \"mild\" but it can be severe in some cases. It said: \"Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.\" Symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever and chickenpox-like blisters, which the NHS say the disease is often confused for. Rashes usually appear one to five days after a person's first symptoms and often begin on the face before spreading to different parts of the patient's body. According to the health service, symptoms tend to clear between two to four weeks. A full list of symptoms includes: A person can get monkeypox by coming into contact with infected wild animals, mostly in West and central Africa. The NHS explained: \"It's thought to be spread by rodents, such as rats, mice and squirrels. You can catch monkeypox from an infected animal if you're bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs.\" Infected uncooked meat can also cause a person to catch the disease, or by touching fur, but person-to-person infection is very uncommon.

He said: \"It's to be expected that we'll get the occasional case here and there. \"There were also a couple in the middle of last year. \"This particular virus doesn't spread as easily, so we're not going to see a big outbreak like we did with Covid. \"It's a little bit more like Lassa fever in that regard.\" Earlier this year health chiefs confirmed there had been three cases of Lassa fever, including one fatality, linked to travel to Mali. But because the virus has a low transmission rate, the outbreak is believed to have been effectively contained, Dr Head said. He believes that those who became infected with monkeypox recently may have come into contact with rats or mice carrying the virus, as person-to-person transmission is rare. Dr Head said: \"The virus is often present in rodents. \"If you have close contact with rodents or infected secretions that can transmit monkeypox. That's usually how it's transmitted.\" Symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. It also reveals itself in a rash, often starting on the face, before spreading to other parts of the body - particularly the hands and feet. In most cases people recover within four weeks, and the rash forms a scab which later falls off. It can be fatal in a small number of cases, virologists have said. Dr Head said: \"Its fatality rate varies between one per cent and 15 per cent depending on the outbreak and which country you're looking at. \"It's a potentially serious condition.\" He said that contact tracing has been effective in containing the virus. \"There may be a handful of cases, but we won't be seeing widespread transmission around the country,\" Dr Head said. \"That's simply not going to happen here.\" There have been 10 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK. On Saturday the UKHSA said two people, who live in the same household, had been found to have the virus. One of them did not require hospital treatment and was isolating at home. Officials said where and how they acquired their infection remains under investigation.  A fortnight ago a patient who had travelled to the UK from Nigeria  was being treated for monkeypox  at the Guy’s and St Thomas’  NHS  Foundation Trust, London.  This is not being linked to the two most recent cases, the UKSHA said. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said 558 cases of monkeypox and eight deaths had been reported between 2017 and 2022. Dr Colin Brown, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said: \"We have confirmed two new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on May 7. \"While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low. \"We are contacting any potential close contacts of the case. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice. \"UKHSA and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.\" Last year a person who had travelled to Delta State in Nigeria was found to have monkeypox, alongside two family members. Prior to that there were three cases, two in September 2018 and one in December 2019, as well as a 2018 case linked to contaminated bed linen, UKHSA said. Cases in the UK are rare, with the viral infection - which was first found in humans in 1970 - most prevalent in parts of Western and Central Africa. In most instances it causes a mild illness, with fever usually followed by a rash breaking out, usually on the face. It was first discovered in a colony of monkeys in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1958, with the first human case confirmed in 1970. In most cases it is a \"mild self-limiting\" illness and the majority of people recover within a few weeks, experts say. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, monkeypox has been shown to cause death in as many as 1 in 10 patients in Africa. The CDC says: \"In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. \"Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. \"The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7−14 days but can range from 5−21 days.\"   Read More   Read More", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/truth-uks-monkeypox-outbreak-expert-26977494"},
{"title": "Where are monkeypox cases in UK – and how to tell difference from chickenpox", "author": null, "date": "14:44, 17 May 2022", "text": " Four more people in England have  been diagnosed with monkeypox , bringing the total number of cases so far up to seven. Health authorities stress that the risk to the wider public remains very low.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it has identified common contacts for two of the four most recent confirmed cases. All four of those infected self-identify as gay, bisexual or as men who have sex with men.  UKHSA chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins has urged gay and bisexual men to be watchful for any unusual lesions or rashes, and to contact a  sexual health  service as soon as possible if they notice any. It is as yet unclear how the current outbreak occurred.   There have so far been a total of seven confirmed  monkeypox  cases in the UK. Cases have been  reported  in London and north-east England.   On May 7, the first case was confirmed in England, with  two further cases  - apparently unconnected to the original - reported on May 14. A further three cases were confirmed on May 16, three of them in London and one in the north-east of England.  According to the UKHSA, all four of the new cases have the West African clade of monkeypox, which is considered to be milder than the Central African strain. The first case was reported in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the virus. However, the agency says there is no link between the latest confirmed cases and travel to a country where monkeypox is endemic. How these patients contracted the virus is currently under investigation.  The  NHS  says that monkeypox is sometimes confused with chickenpox. Like chickenpox, monkeypox causes a rash that causes small spots filled with fluid that subsequently turn scabby and can scar.  However, monkeypox is from a different family of viruses than chickenpox. The monkeypox virus is related to the virus that once caused smallpox in humans. Smallpox was declared fully eradicated by the World Health Organisation in 1980, with the UK’s last known smallpox fatality occurring in 1978. Symptoms of monkeypox usually appear within five and 21 days of infection and usually clear up within two to four weeks. Initial symptoms include high temperature, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen glands, shivering and exhaustion.

{"title": "Monkeypox alert as 4 new cases found in England - and none have links to Africa travel", "author": "Antony Thrower", "date": "19:24, 16 May 2022", "text": "Health authorities are on alert as four new cases of monkeypox have been detected in England within the gay community, with none of the patients having travelled to Africa. Three of those identified were found in London and the fourth is in the north east of the nation. All four self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, leading to warnings from the UK Health Security Agency to those in the community to stay aware. The latest cases bring the total number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK to seven, diagnosed between May 6 and 15. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to West Africa and is spread by very close contact with someone with the virus, with most people recovering within a few weeks. There are no known connections to those who have already tested positive for the virus, which has a fatality rate varying between one and 15% depending on the outbreak. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. “UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. “We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” Patients needing medical care are all in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hospital, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and Guys’ and St Thomas’. The individuals have the West African clade of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African clade. Anyone within the gay community are asked to aware of any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with Monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals.  Earlier today  global health expert Dr Michael Head of Southampton University told The Mirror the recent spate of cases was not cause for alarm .
