Leeds Pride: Event to offer monkeypox advice and help,,2022-08-03 15:32:26,"Forty-nine cases have been recorded in the Yorkshire and Humber region, out of more than 2,700 cases UK-wide. While anyone can get monkeypox, the majority of cases have been recorded in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Health charities will provide help and testing support at the event. Yorkshire MESMAC will be on hand with information on Sunday. Chief executive Tom Doyle said:  ""Anyone with monkeypox can pass it on through close contact, regardless of sexual orientation, but currently gay and bi men are disproportionately affected. ""Particularly in Leeds, we're working really closely together with our NHS partners to identify people who are most at risk of monkeypox so they can be invited in for a vaccination."" Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. The city council's health team advised people to check for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters, before going to a party or event. Victoria Eaton, director of public health for Leeds, said: ""If you think you may have symptoms of monkeypox, even if they are mild, please stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice, your call will be treated sensitively and confidentially. ""Avoid close personal or sexual contact with others until you have had a clinical assessment.""

Monkeypox: Risk is low in Scotland as 54 cases confirmed,,2022-07-24 11:13:22,"Prof Linda Bauld said only a small number of cases had been identified north of the border, it is a mild illness and there is a vaccine.  It came as the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global health emergency.  There have been 54 confirmed cases of the virus in Scotland since 23 May.  They are among 2,208 confirmed cases in the UK.  Most are men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. They are also linked to recent travel to London or Europe.  WHO declares highest alert over monkeypox Prof Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh and chief social policy adviser at the Scottish government, told  BBC Radio Scotland's The Sunday Show : ""The risk to the public in Scotland remains low.  ""The numbers are really small. It's a mild illness and we have a vaccine originally developed for smallpox.  ""So it's totally different from Covid-19 and that's a very important point to make."" The virus is not sexually transmitted but it is passed by very close contact, she added.  ""The reason the World Health Organisation has triggered this emergency response .... is to send a very clear message to a number of countries who may not be responding to this global outbreak that more action is needed,"" she said.  ""I know we're still in and coming out of a pandemic, we are going to see diseases like this emerge but it needs to be put in a broader context and not alarm people."" Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.  What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Earlier Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf urged anyone with concerns to contact their GP or sexual health clinic.  In a tweet, he said: ""While concerning, ScotGovt & PHS been working for many months on 4 Nations basis on our Monkeypox response.""  ""If you're concerned about possible exposure/symptoms, contact your GP or sexual health clinic if appropriate,"" he added.  View original tweet on Twitter Public Health Scotland has said it is ""generally a mild self-limiting illness"" and most people recover within a few weeks.  Close contacts of people with the virus no longer need to isolate at home if they don't have symptoms.  Vaccinations are being offered to some men at higher risk of exposure to the infection and a small number of healthcare workers in high risk settings.  Dr Nick Phin, medical director at Public Health Scotland, said they know monkeypox is predominantly being spread through close skin-to-skin activity. ""The incubation period for monkeypox however is up to 21 days, so if you are aware that you are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, please do take additional precautions during this time,"" he said. ""These include avoiding close skin-to-skin contact with others, such as hugging, kissing, or sexual contact, even if you don't have any symptoms.  ""If you do develop symptoms, you should self-isolate immediately and contact your GP or local sexual health clinic."" More than 16,000 cases of monkeypox  have been reported in 75 countries, according to WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus.  He said there had been five deaths as a result of the outbreak.  There are two other health emergencies at present - the coronavirus pandemic and the continuing effort to eradicate polio.

LGBT groups demand more action on monkeypox,By Josh Parry,2022-08-05 09:14:20,"In an open letter to Health Secretary Steven Barclay, they say that without a quicker and wider vaccine rollout, the virus could become ""endemic"".  There have been more than 2,600 cases of  monkeypox  in the UK so far, mostly among men who have sex with men. The Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) says it is working ""rapidly"" to vaccinate those at risk. With two of the UK's most popular Pride events, in  Brighton  this weekend, and Manchester later in August, many people are trying to get vaccinated in order to feel safer. BBC News has spoken to gay and bisexual men who say they have struggled to get the jab at their local clinics, and have had to travel to London or other large cities. A spokesperson for the DHSC said it had already administered thousands of vaccines and that it is ""working rapidly"" to offer more appointments. They said: ""We have procured over 150,000 vaccines, and we're working with partners - including the NHS and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) - to share targeted, non-stigmatising communications with the LGBTQ+ community."" Currently about  75% of monkeypox cases are in London , which is where the majority of vaccines have been targeted, but numbers outside the city are also increasing.  What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  We have 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses - minister 'Formidable' challenges as monkeypox spreads - WHO Monkeypox: 'I never thought it would be something I'd get' The Terrence Higgins Trust, which co-wrote  the letter , says the rollout needs to be speeded up across the UK to help combat ""fear and anxiety"" within the LGBT community. Its head of policy Ceri Smith told BBC News: ""We need to see far better co-ordination, increased vaccine procurement, improved delivery and a cash injection to sexual health services to treat monkeypox."" The letter was also signed by representatives from LGBT groups for the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the Green Party. It reads: ""Without urgent action, we risk monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK. This poses a serious risk to health and will exacerbate the  health inequalities already experienced by gay and bisexual men  and other men who have sex with men. ""Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK.""  The letter also asks the government to deliver clearer messaging aimed at men who have sex with men about the symptoms of the virus, and what steps people should take if they believe they have become infected.  As of 1 August, NHS England stated that more than 14,000 people had received Imvanex, a vaccine designed to protect against smallpox, which the UKHSA says helps protect people who could be exposed to monkeypox. The UKHSA says  an extra 100,000 vaccines  will arrive in the UK in September, with the aim of delivering the first 20,000 for use by the NHS this month. Current guidance is to give most people a single dose. But some sexual health experts  estimate around 250,000  vaccines are needed, and have recommended that people should be given two doses for maximum protection. The monkeypox vaccine rollout is being co-ordinated locally by sexual health clinics across the UK, with each clinic taking an individual approach based on urgency and need.  This means there are different approaches to inviting people to appointments, and differences in who is considered high risk across the country.  Dr Mary Ramsay, director of clinical programmes at UKHSA, told the BBC that the vaccine is ""being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox, in order to offer them protection and contain the current outbreak."" She added: ""We continue to monitor supply and remain in discussion with the manufacturer."" Alex Bradbrook, a civil servant from Manchester, considers himself to be in a high-risk category for acquiring monkeypox. He was vaccinated at a clinic in London while visiting for the weekend, after struggling to get one closer to home for several weeks. He told the BBC: ""I was in London for the weekend and found out via Twitter that a clinic in Hammersmith was offering the vaccine, so I called about 20 times and finally got through to someone and got an appointment."" While he's aware the vaccine isn't 100% effective in preventing monkeypox, Alex says it's a relief when heading to Pride events that he has some protection. He added: ""Now that I've got my jab I feel much more reassured. The minute that needle went in, it was like a huge weight being lifted off my mind.  ""I'm really fortunate that I was already in London and able to get one. There are lots of people who just aren't in my position - people who either can't afford a train or can't get down there for whatever reason. It makes me quite angry that some people don't seem to be getting an adequate service who might be at high risk.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62425720,The BBC
Monkeypox: CDC says US leads globally in most known cases,By Bernd  Debusmann Jr,2022-07-26 14:27:13,"The rising number of cases has reportedly prompted the Biden administration to mull declaring a national health emergency.  The virus has already been classified as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).  To date, more than 18,000 cases have been reported in 75 countries.  According to data published online by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 25 July there were 3,846 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases in the US.  The figure - which comes amid expanded testing in addition to the growing outbreak of the virus - is now ahead of that of Spain, where 3,105 cases have so far been reported.  The two other countries with the highest number of infections, Germany and the UK, have reported 2,352 and 2,208 cases, respectively.  What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma With cases in the US rising, the Washington Post on 25 July reported that the Biden administration was considering declaring a public health emergency.  The measure would allow the government to use federal funds to combat the outbreak, raise public awareness and better collect relevant health data.  Additionally, the administration is reportedly preparing to name a coordinator to oversee the government's response to monkeypox from the White House.  On July 21, 50 Democratic lawmakers sent an open letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to declare a public health emergency and send millions of vaccine doses to the US from manufacturing facilities overseas.  While officials have said that gay and bisexual men - as well as healthcare workers - have so far been most at risk, fears are mounting that the virus could spread to other segments of the population.  On 22 July, the US confirmed the first cases of monkeypox in children.  The US response to the virus has so far been plagued by vaccine shortages and a slow start to testing, leading some to compare the situation to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.  In Washington DC, for example, officials have warned that a ""rapid increase in cases"", coupled with a ""very limited"" supply of vaccines, means that authorities must prioritise high-risk residents.  The city currently has the highest per capita total of infections, with 172 cases reported in the district. Most monkeypox cases are mild, with initial symptoms including a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a blistery, chickenpox-like rash or lesions.  So far, no deaths from the virus have been reported in the US. ",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62308455,The BBC
Monkeypox: US confirms first two cases in children,By Sam Cabral,2022-07-22 22:33:31,"One patient is a California toddler and the other is a non-US resident infant who was ""transiting through"" the Washington DC area. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said both children were ""doing well"". Children under eight are at high risk of severe monkeypox, said the agency. More than 2,500 cases of the virus have been recorded across the country. Most cases have been detected among gay and bisexual men in frequent sexual contact. But the CDC is now aware of at least eight cases in cisgender women, the agency told reporters on Friday. Monkeypox is not considered purely a sexually transmitted infection (STI) - the disease is also passed on by close contact with an infected person.

On Sunday, former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the country was likely ""at the cusp"" of seeing the virus become endemic. ""I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed, and if it hasn't closed it's certainly starting to close,"" he told CBS News' Face the Nation programme.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62274245,The BBC

He said he ""realised it wasn't Covid"" when he began to notice blisters. Vaccines to protect against monkeypox are now being offered at a clinic at the University of the West of England. Conor said he was confined to his room and ""was quite ill with [monkeypox] for 10 or 11 days"". After that he said he ""did feel much better but you're still isolating until the blisters heal"", so he spent about three weeks in isolation.  He said he was testing a number of times daily with Covid-like symptoms before the blisters appeared, which have now left ""quite small"" scars.  There are more than 50 cases of monkeypox in the south west, a number that has doubled since mid-July, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which  starts on the face and spreads to the body . The virus can be spread through close physical contact, sharing bedding, coughs and sneezes and most people experience mild symptoms.  Gareth Williams, professor of medicine at the University of Bristol, said: ""There are outbreaks cropping up all over the place now and the sensible thing to stop it going global is to get in there and stamp those outbreaks out as soon as it's detected.""

Monkeypox: Sufferer from Leeds urges education over 'awful' virus,,2022-08-05 14:19:34,"Christopher Longstaff, 24, from Leeds, said when he became unwell a week ago he thought he had Covid or flu. He said he was shocked when he was diagnosed with monkeypox and struggled to find information about the illness. There are currently 49 monkeypox cases in Yorkshire and the Humber, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Mr Longstaff said his symptoms included fatigue, a sore throat, headaches and a fever. The condition also caused lesions on his skin and in his throat.  The monkeypox diagnosis was confirmed after a throat swab was taken. He was admitted to hospital the next day as his symptoms worsened. Mr Longstaff said: ""I was a bit shocked because I didn't know anything about monkeypox. There's not that much research out there."" He said he had looked for stories about other patients' experiences for reassurance, but instead found ""scaremongering"" posts on social media. Mr Longstaff said he had been planning to celebrate Leeds Pride this weekend with friends, but now faced at least three weeks of self-isolation in his shared house. Pride event to offer monkeypox advice and help He added that he wanted more people to make themselves aware of the risks of the illness. ""I wouldn't wish this on any person.

Monkeypox vaccine shortage as cases in Scotland increase,,2022-08-09 17:02:03,"The latest figures show 69 people in Scotland have the  virus , an increase of two in a week. Officials are aiming to administer more than 6,000 jags but only around 3,000 have been distributed to the country's health boards. Men who have sex with other men, along with healthcare workers, are being prioritised for vaccination. There are global supply issues with the jag because it is only being manufactured by one company. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Can we still stop the outbreak? The UK has placed an order for 100,000 doses that are expected to be delivered next month. Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland, said between 700 and 800 vaccines had been administered. Of the 69 cases in Scotland, just one was a woman, and most have been concentrated in urban settings. None of the patients are seriously ill with the virus.  The total figure has risen by two since the  last update on Friday . Dr Phin said ""most, if not all"" of those who were recently infected had been abroad or visited London. In a briefing to journalists on Tuesday, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health improvement manager Nicky Coia said the hope was to vaccinate between 6,000 and 6,500 people as soon as possible to tackle the outbreak. Dr Phin said: ""Vaccine is in short supply – there's one manufacturing company that had until recently only been producing sufficient stock for a very limited number of countries. ""It has now stepped up its production and in fact most countries globally are almost competing to try and get what they perceive to be needed for their countries."" He added: ""Vaccine stock is an issue and will continue to be an issue until the 100,000 doses that have been ordered, and ordered some weeks ago, arrive in the UK."" It is not yet known how many of the 100,000 doses will be allocated to Scotland. Dr Phin expressed said the vaccine is ""98-99%"" effective. Mr Coia also stressed the importance of the groups most at risk of contracting the virus taking action to protect themselves. He urged people who are in sexual networks where monkeypox might be present to reduce the number of partners they would normally have until they get their vaccine. Mr Coia added: ""We would also say that condoms are great at protecting against sexually transmitted infections and HIV, but condoms unfortunately won't protect against monkeypox – so keep using them but it's not the only method of protection."" He also encouraged those at risk of the virus to check their skin frequently for any lesions that could be associated with the virus. ",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-62484578,The BBC
US monkeypox outbreak: Demand for vaccines outstrips supply,,2022-07-16 00:34:47,"The US has seen more than 1,800 cases so far, though that is thought to be an undercount as testing has also lagged. There has been growing concern about the rate at which monkeypox is spreading - especially in New York City, the epicentre of the US outbreak.  The disease, characterised by lesions on the skin, usually clears up on its own but can be extremely painful.   Most confirmed cases have been among men who have sex with men, although anyone can be infected with the virus. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  ""We don't yet have all the vaccine that we would like in this moment,"" US Centers for Disease Control director Rochelle Walensky told a news briefing on Friday. The US has received 370,000 out of nearly 7m vaccine doses that the government has purchased in total. But millions of the doses are not expected to arrive until next year. The federal government has distributed about 156,000 doses nationwide and expects to start shipping another 130,000 doses from Monday, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier this week, New York city's vaccinations website crashed as thousands of people tried to book vaccine appointments at once. New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan apologised for the patchy roll-out of the vaccine. ""We own it. You know, those mistakes shouldn't happen and so we're working to correct those and do better,"" he said at a news conference.  During a call on Tuesday with Biden administration officials, New York Mayor Eric Adams asked for the city to be allocated more doses.

What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?,,2022-08-05 16:19:14,"In the UK there have been around 2,800 confirmed cases in recent weeks. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but the UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against monkeypox. More than 100,000 vaccine doses have been bought to try and stamp out the disease.  Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low.  It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been more than 1,200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year. Two main strains of the virus - west African and central African - are known to exist, and it's the milder one from west Africa which is now circulating in other regions of the world. The unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region, means the virus is now spreading in the community. The  UK Health Security Agency  says anyone concerned they could be infected should phone NHS 111 or contact their local sexual health clinic, but call or email ahead of a visit. It is also advising those infected not to have sex while they have symptoms and use condoms for eight weeks after an infection, as a precaution. Monkeypox cases rise as new UK sex advice issued What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring.  The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.  Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth.  It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact. Guidance  is advising anyone with the virus to abstain from sex while they have symptoms. While there is currently no available evidence that monkeypox can be spread in sexual fluids, people confirmed to have the virus are advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution. It can also be spread by contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, or by virus-contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothing.  Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in west Africa.  Although some of the cases have been seen in gay and bisexual men, anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has monkeypox could potentially get the virus.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma The virus was first identified in a captive monkey and since 1970 there have been sporadic outbreaks reported across 10 African countries.  In 2003 there was an outbreak in the US, the first time it had been seen outside Africa. Patients caught the disease from close contact with prairie dogs that had been infected by small mammals imported into the country. A total of 81 cases were reported, but none resulted in deaths.   In 2017, Nigeria experienced the largest known outbreak. There were 172 suspected cases and 75% of victims were men between 21 and 40 years old. Outbreaks can be controlled by infection prevention.  Vaccination against smallpox has been proven to be 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. The  UK has bought tens of thousands of doses of the smallpox vaccine  and some high-risk close contacts of people infected will be offered one to reduce the risk of symptoms appearing. Antiviral drugs may also help and the UK has approved one, called tecovirimat, for this. Health protection teams are contacting people who've come into close contact with confirmed cases and are at high risk. They are offering advice and monitoring them. They are advising anyone else who has been in close contact with someone infected by monkeypox to isolate at home for up to 21 days.

A quarter of these cases have appeared in the state of New York, which declared its own state of emergency over the disease last week. The two states with the next highest caseloads - California and Illinois - declared states of emergency earlier this week. More than 26,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide this year, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows.

But many who have tried to get the jab have reported waiting in long lines, only to be told there aren't enough to go round.  Some have questioned whether Mr Biden should have called this nationwide state of emergency earlier - and whether this will be enough to prevent further spread.  San Francisco introduced a public health state of emergency on Monday. In doing so, the mayor invoked memories of the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1980s - when she says the city was ignored.  ""We are in a very scary place"", she said.  The declaration on Thursday comes amid reports that vaccines and treatments for monkeypox are in short supply across the country. The Department of Health and Human Services said last week that it has ordered more than five million more doses, to be delivered until next May. Earlier this week, the White House also announced the appointment of a team to co-ordinate and oversee the national monkeypox response.  It includes Dr Demetre Daskalakis, a New York physician who has led successful initiatives to curb the spread of HIV in the US.

Monkeypox: Can we still stop the outbreak?,,2022-08-05 23:18:30,"But now it has gone global - it is spreading in ways that have not been seen before and on a scale that is unprecedented.  There have been nearly 27,000 confirmed cases of the disease - mostly in men having sex with other men - across 88 countries.  The World Health Organization says this is a global emergency. So can monkeypox be stopped? Or are we now doomed to have another virus spreading around the world?  There are three things we need to consider: There's nothing special about the biology of monkeypox virus. It is not an unstoppable force.  Covid probably was - it spreads so readily that it was arguably impossible to contain even in the earliest days of the pandemic.  But monkeypox has a harder time getting from one person to the next. It needs close physical contact - such as through infected skin, prolonged face-to-face contact or contaminated surfaces like a bedsheet or a towel. The two viruses are simply in different leagues, and past monkeypox outbreaks have just fizzled out.  And we have already overcome the far greater challenge of defeating the virus's deadly cousin, smallpox. ""Monkeypox is easier as it is less transmissible than smallpox so we're in a much better position,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham.  However, one issue is some people have mild symptoms or ones that can be easily mistaken for a sexually transmitted disease or chickenpox. That means it can be unwittingly passed on to others.  Monkeypox: What are the symptoms? The virus has got into a group of people who are having enough sex or enough intimate contact with enough partners for it to overcome its own inadequacies and spread.  The virus is not a classed as a sexually transmitted infection. But a study  in the New England Journal of Medicine  estimated 95% of monkeypox infections were being acquired through sex, particularly sex between men. Sex, obviously, is full of all the intimate skin-on-skin contact that the virus uses to spread.  That leaves two options for containing the disease - persuading people to have less sex; or to reduce the risk of catching the infection when exposed.  Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""The easiest way to prevent it is to close down all highly active sexual networks for a couple of months until it goes away, but I don't think that will ever happen - do you?"" Some people do adjust their sex lives in response to warnings about monkeypox and advice has been targeted at those most at risk.  But Prof Hunter argues the lesson of sexually transmitted infections - from syphilis in the Middle Ages through to now - is that people still have sex and ""vaccination is pretty much the only option"". Fortunately, the smallpox vaccine which was used to eradicate that virus is around 85% effective at preventing monkeypox.  There are limited supplies as stockpiles are kept in case of someone weaponising smallpox, not to tackle an unprecedented monkeypox outbreak. However, not everyone at risk would need vaccinating to stop the outbreak. ""Herd immunity"" means that once a critical threshold of people are protected the virus can no longer spread. This will be much easier to achieve with monkeypox than other diseases - including Covid. While anybody can catch monkeypox, it is gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who are disproportionately affected in this outbreak. This can make it easier to control the virus as, overall, it is a group that is more clued into sexual health. It also allows resources to be targeted at those who need it - such as vaccinating men having sex with men rather than the whole population.  However, stigma, discrimination and abuse can stop people seeking help, particularly in countries where  sex between men is illegal . ""Some countries don't have infrastructure in place and some may not have the will to test for monkeypox, because it's men who have sex with men,"" said Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London.  There are still challenges in countries that support LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender - rights. Even policies such as asking people to isolate - which we're so familiar with from Covid - can have unintended consequences.  ""That's tantamount to coming out - whether to a wife or parents [as you suddenly have to explain why] - so there is a strong pressure not to say who your contacts were,"" said Prof Hunter. Already some countries do appear to be getting on top of the virus. The UK says the number of infections appears to have levelled off  at around 35-a-day . But cases continue to soar elsewhere, including the US which  has declared an emergency . But it won't be enough for just rich countries to get on top of the virus when it's now  in more than 80 countries  that don't have a long history of the disease.  ""It's very unclear to me whether it will be controlled completely, some countries will get on top of it, some might not,"" said Prof Balloux. The WHO's technical lead for monkeypox, Dr Rosamund Lewis, says it is ""possible"" to end the outbreak but warns ""we don't have a crystal ball"" and it's not clear if the organisation will be able to ""support countries enough and communities enough to stop this outbreak."" The endemic countries in Africa - where monkeypox is always there - will continue to deal with the virus as it continually jumps from wild animals into people.  Studies have shown  the problem is getting worse  since the smallpox eradication programme ended, as few people under 50 will have been immunised.  The only thing that would stop that is a mass vaccination campaign, ""but there's a big debate in Africa whether that is appropriate or necessary,"" says Prof Hunter.  The worry is monkeypox could become a permanent presence in people around the globe rather than just in countries with infected animals. At the moment that is in men having sex with men, but the longer the outbreak goes on the more chances the virus has to establish itself more widely.  There have been isolated cases in children and women, but these have not kickstarted their own outbreaks in classrooms or workplaces. However, the risks increase as the virus is given time to become better at infecting people. We have witnessed how Covid evolved and variants such as Omicron became so much better at infecting us.  ""Unless the virus changes I personally doubt it will spread in children or more generally in people who don't have many sexual partners,"" said Prof Balloux. ""But the longer the wait, the higher the risk it might change,"" he said. The other issue is monkeypox has a knack for infecting a wide range of mammals including squirrels, rats, dormice and monkeys in Africa.  There is a danger that the virus could get a foothold in other animals and start bouncing between species.  The 2003 monkeypox outbreak in the US  - which led to 47 cases across six states - was driven by pet prairie dogs. Tackling this outbreak of monkeypox is possible, but the longer we leave it the harder it gets and the greater the risk.  on Twitter. haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Monkeypox: WHO declares highest alert over outbreak,By Robert Plummer,2022-07-23 15:23:06,"The classification is the highest alert that the WHO can issue and follows a worldwide upsurge in cases. It came at the end of the second meeting of the WHO's emergency committee on the virus. More than 16,000 cases have now been reported from 75 countries, said WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. There had been five deaths so far as a result of the outbreak, he added. There are only two other such health emergencies at present - the coronavirus pandemic and the continuing effort to eradicate polio. Dr Tedros said the emergency committee had been unable to reach a consensus on whether the monkeypox outbreak should be classified as a global health emergency. However, he said the outbreak had spread around the world rapidly and he had decided that it was indeed of international concern. Too little was understood about the new modes of transmission which had allowed it to spread, said Dr Tedros. ""The WHO's assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region, where we assess the risk as high,"" he added. There was also a clear risk of further international spread, although the risk of interference with international traffic remained low for the moment, he said. Dr Tedros said the declaration would help speed up the development of vaccines and the implementation of measures to limit the spread of the virus.  The WHO is also issuing recommendations which it hopes will spur countries to take action to stop transmission of the virus and protect those most at risk. ""This is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups,"" Dr Tedros said. What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Human monkeypox was first identified in the early 1970s in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In the UK, there have so far been  more than 2,000 confirmed cases .  Health officials are already recommending people at highest risk of exposure to monkeypox - including some gay and bisexual men, as well as some healthcare workers -  should be offered a vaccine . Initial symptoms typically include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a blistery, chickenpox-like rash or lesions - often on the mouth or genitals in the recent cases. Infections are usually mild. Declaring a global emergency is a significant act. It is a rallying cry for countries to take the virus seriously, it raises awareness around the world and it can help poorer countries get the tools they need to control monkeypox.  In principle, we have the tools to stop the virus. Monkeypox does not spread as easily as Covid and we already have a vaccine (developed for smallpox) that offers good protection.  And while anyone can catch monkeypox, the outbreak is overwhelmingly concentrated in gay and bisexual men, as well as other men who have sex with men. This can make the outbreak easier to tackle, as efforts, including vaccines and public health information, can be targeted at those most at risk.  But remember, there are still countries where same-sex relationships are illegal - and stigma and persecution can act as a barrier to help. Whether we can stop monkeypox is as much a societal and cultural challenge as it is about the virus.

WHO declares highest alert over monkeypox Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the patient in the city is stable and recovering from the infection. ""There is no need to panic,"" he added. The man had travelled to Himachal Pradesh state before he fell ill - surveillance teams are checking whether he could have contracted the infection there, or from a friend,  The Indian Express newspaper  reported. The first three cases in India were reported from the southern state of Kerala - all of them had travelled to the state recently from countries in the Gulf region.  Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency. More than 16,000 cases have now been reported from 75 countries, said WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""The WHO's assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region, where we assess the risk as high,"" he said.

Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. The virus spreads when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks  a rash can develop , often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.

"Monkeypox: More vaccines needed for 2,500 people most at risk",By Aileen Moynagh,2022-07-27 17:35:03,"But it said it hoped there would be sufficient vaccines by September for the 2,500 people deemed eligible. The PHA said cases, which have risen to 18 in Northern Ireland, are mainly seen in gay and bisexual men, but anyone could potentially catch the virus. The virus is not new but only  arrived in Northern Ireland in May 2022. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox , although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been more than 1,200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year. Two main strains of the virus - west African and central African - are known to exist, and it's the milder one from west Africa which is now circulating in other regions of the world. Dr Jillian Johnston from the PHA said monkey pox was spread by direct skin-to-skin contact. ""It can also be spread through contaminated bed linen and towels and sometimes to a lesser extent can be spread from coughing and sneezing of somebody who is currently symptomatic with the disease,"" she said. Dr Johnston said vaccines were being made available for people considered to be at a higher risk of exposure to monkeypox, including health workers. ""We have identified about 2,500 individuals who would be eligible to receive the vaccination.  ""Of that the vaccine supply that we have received into Northern Ireland so far has been about 20%, so just under 500 doses. ""It is a slight concern that we have only limited supply at the moment. However I am reassured that more supply is coming into the UK both this week and throughout August and September."" The Belfast Trust said it would begin administering the monkeypox vaccine at the weekend. It said the vaccine would be only offered to patients who had been invited to attend for vaccination and had an appointment. The PHA reminded people attending Belfast Pride at the weekend to check themselves for symptoms. John O'Doherty from the Rainbow Project, who is one of organisers of Pride, said it was important to get the right message out. ""It's important that we're sharing the message based on health evidence to ensure that those people most at risk are getting the information,"" he said.  ""We must also proactively fight the stigma that exists around these types of infections and particularly around gay and bisexual men.  ""The entire focus on sex and sexual activity about something that isn't about sex or sexual activity.  ""That is the stigma that we are seeing.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62322449,The BBC
Monkeypox: First deaths outside Africa in Brazil and Spain,By Malu Cursino,2022-07-30 11:33:10,"A 41-year-old man in Brazil became the first fatality from the virus outside Africa. Spain announced two deaths soon afterwards - the first in Europe.  Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency.  But infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low. On Friday Brazil's health ministry said the victim there had suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system, and ""comorbidities aggravated his condition"".  Brazil has so far reported 1,066 confirmed cases and 513 suspected cases of the virus. Data from Brazil's health ministry indicates that more than 98% of confirmed cases were in men who have sex with men. Shortly afterwards, Spain's health ministry confirmed Europe's first death from the virus - a patient who suffered from encephalitis. A second death linked to monkeypox was confirmed by Spanish authorities on Saturday. The health ministry said that of 3,750 monkeypox patients with available information, 120 or 3.2% had been hospitalised.

Kerala Health Minister Veena George said the man had initially tested positive for the virus abroad. Samples tested after his death also detected the virus, she said on Monday.  This is the fourth monkeypox death reported globally, outside of Africa. Monday also saw health authorities in Ghana confirm the West African nation's first death from the virus in the current outbreak. The infected person was a military officer who died three days after reporting to a hospital in the north-east of the country. He had a fever and a skin rash, but no further details were available.

The young man had developed fever and had swollen lymph nodes when he was admitted to a private hospital on 27 July, Ms George  told the news website The NewsMinute  on Sunday. He, however, had no rashes on his body and the doctors saw no reason to suspect that he had monkeypox, she said. The man had tested positive for the virus in the UAE on 19 July, days before he left for Kerala, but his family informed health officials only on 30 July, the minister said on Monday.  His condition, however, quickly deteriorated in the hospital and he was on ventilator support before he died, she added. His samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology which confirmed monkeypox on Monday, she said. Authorities will now investigate why the man had delayed seeking medical help. Twenty close contacts of the man have been categorised as ""high risk"" and isolated, the minister told reporters. These include his friends, family and nine people he recently played football with. Passengers who were on the flight with him from UAE to Kerala have also been contacted. There is, however, no cause for concern yet since they were not in close contact with him, Ms George said. India has reported four cases of monkeypox so far - three in Kerala and one in the capital, Delhi. The first patient, who tested positive on 14 July, was treated in Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum). He has since recovered and been discharged, Ms George said on Saturday.

Margaret Ferrier court case affected by monkeypox,,2022-06-14 14:55:26,"Margaret Ferrier allegedly went by train from Glasgow to London and back again having been told to self-isolate in September 2020. Glasgow Sheriff Court heard her defence team had failed to obtain a report from a virologist due to the monkeypox outbreak. The trial date was kept for 15 August.  The Rutherglen and Hamilton West representative, who is 61, is accused of making several journeys after being told to self-isolate between 26 and 29 September 2020. Prosecutors allege that the MP, who was suspended by the SNP in September 2020, booked a test for Covid-19, stating in the booking application that she had symptoms of the disease. The charge claims she was told to self-isolate but wilfully exposed people to the risk of infection, illness and death. It is alleged this was done by travelling throughout Glasgow and the surrounding areas as well as going on journeys to and from London. At a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday, the MP - who had her appearance excused - pled not guilty to the single charge through her lawyer Neal McShane. Mr McShane said the defence intended to get a report from a virologist. Mr McShane said: ""We passed the paperwork but unfortunately his difficulty is, due to the outbreak of monkeypox, he is required to work for a number of agencies in respect of that and as such we don't have the report. ""This will need to be confirmed by Ms Ferrier if she is willing to fund that report as this is being funded on a private basis."" Prosecutor Mark Allan told the court that he had been in dialogue with Ms Ferrier's counsel Brian McConnachie QC. He said: ""There is significant amount of evidence which can be agreed which will cut down the length of the trial."" Sheriff Gerard Considine stated that a five-day trial estimate had previously been given. Mr Allan replied that that would be ""ambitious."" A pre-trial hearing has been set for 26 July. The charge states Ms Ferrier was at a variety of locations over the three days in question. These include locations in Rutherglen such as Lifestyle Leisure centre, Sweet P Boutique and Vanilla Salon. She also allegedly visited Grace and Flavour in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, as well as St Mungo's Church, Glasgow, and Vic's Bar in Prestwick, Ayrshire. The charge states Ms Ferrier made a taxi journey from her home in Glasgow's Cambuslang to the city's Central train station. It is claimed she travelled to London Euston station and elsewhere in the English capital including the Houses of Parliament. She is then said to have made the return journey to Glasgow from London by train. Ms Ferrier's bail has been continued.",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-61801442,The BBC

Monkeypox wasn’t created in a lab - and other claims debunked,By Rachel Schraer,2022-05-28 23:18:50,"A common fear shared online is that restrictions on movement are being planned. One account told followers to get ready for ""monkeypox lockdowns"" and ""monkeypox tyranny"".  While fears about the monkeypox outbreak are understandable, scientists say this virus is not like Covid, and most experts think its spread will be limited.   It is much harder to pass on than Covid, we already have available vaccines and treatments, and people appear to be infectious only once symptoms appear - making it easier to spot and isolate. So restrictions such as lockdowns or mass vaccinations are ""really not going to be the way to respond to this"", says Prof Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Centre at the University of Oxford.   Instead, isolation measures and vaccines are currently being targeted at infected people or their close contacts.   What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox case confirmed in England Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma Dr Rosamund Lewis, of the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergencies Programme, confirmed there was no need for mass vaccination, and the WHO has also recommended against any travel restrictions.  It's no surprise people's minds now turn to Covid when news of an unfamiliar virus breaks.  But the Institute for Strategic Dialogue has noted that recent outbreaks of monkeypox were also ""reviving the spread of a set of cut-and-paste... conspiracies"" which have been used over the past two years to mislead people during the Covid pandemic Social media accounts and news outlets in Ukraine, Russia, China and the US have all made accusations that the outbreak was the result of a laboratory leak, or the use of monkeypox as a biological weapon.  It's possible to identify where a virus is likely to have come from by sequencing its DNA. Geneticist Fatima Tokhmafshan likens this to scanning a barcode on a parcel to ""map the different paths [it] has taken"".  The genetic sequences we have so far for the virus all trace it back to the strain of monkeypox which commonly circulates in West Africa: ""That tells us this is not something manufactured"".   There were a  handful of cases in the UK in 2018  and  in 2021 , and a  larger outbreak in the US,  also in 2021, each brought over by human travellers or imported animals.   ""So it's entirely plausible that that's exactly what's happened this time, ""says Prof Horby, ""and it's by far the most likely scenario.""  The earliest case identified in the UK in the current outbreak was traced to someone who had travelled from Nigeria. As for the idea that monkeypox escaped from a lab, ""there is absolutely no basis for that claim at all"", Prof Horby says. There are those claiming online that the current monkeypox outbreak was deliberately planned - with many pointing the finger at Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci, in an echo of Covid conspiracies.   This unfounded assertion is being shared across Russia media, on the Chinese social app Weibo, and on Instagram. It can also be found on Facebook in Romanian, German, English, Arabic, French, Slovenian, Hungarian and Punjabi. The claims point to a document prepared by a US-based biosecurity organisation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI).  In 2021, NTI conducted a workshop to encourage leaders from around the world to plan for the possibility of future pandemics.  The participants were asked to work through a fictional scenario - a ""deadly, global pandemic involving an unusual strain of monkeypox virus... [that] spread globally"".   ""The risks posed by monkeypox"", according to the NTI, ""have been well documented for years"" and cases have been on the increase, making it an obvious virus to choose for this workshop. Outbreaks of infection are a fact of life, so an organisation predicting and planning for them is not in itself suspicious.  This claim has taken two forms - some point to the fact the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a virus found in chimpanzees, modified so it cannot replicate and spread.  These social media posts then suggest a link between vaccines employing that chimp virus and the monkeypox outbreak. However, monkeypox is caused by a totally different type of virus to the one found in the AstraZeneca vaccine - and is actually thought to be mostly found in rodents, not monkeys.  The second type of claim spreading online is that the Covid vaccine somehow suppresses your immune system, making you more vulnerable to other infections.  This claim has no basis in reality. Vaccines stimulate - not deplete - your immune system, making it more effective at targeting a particular infection. While there are a very small number of cases of people having autoimmune reactions to vaccines, where your body starts attacking itself (the cause of rare blood clots after AstraZeneca), there is no evidence of vaccines suppressing the immune system or altering your ability to fight other diseases.

Monkeypox patients should avoid pet contact,By Jim Reed,2022-05-27 14:06:08,"So far, 106 people in the UK have been confirmed as infected with the virus. Gerbils, hamsters and other rodents could be particularly susceptible to the disease and the concern is it could spread in the animal population.  The government said no cases have been detected in pets so far and the risk is still low. ""The worry is the virus could get into domestic animals and essentially ping-pong between them and humans,"" said Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick. ""If you are not careful you might create an animal reservoir for the disease that could result in it spreading back into humans, and we'll be in a loop of infection."" What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? How to tell if a rash is monkeypox Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma The guidance from the UKHSA and other health authorities recommends that pet guinea pigs, rats, mice and other rodents should be removed from the household of someone infected with monkeypox for 21 days, and be tested for the disease.  There are thought to be two million households in the UK with a pet rodent of some kind, according to sales data. Other pets like dogs and cats should be placed under household isolation with regular vet checks to ""ensure no clinical signs are observed"". Related advice from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says that ""where possible"" the patient should avoid preparing food or grooming their pet if this can be done by someone else in the household.  England's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: ""No cases of monkeypox have ever been suspected or reported in pets in the UK and the risk remains low.  ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with veterinary and public health colleagues, both in the UK and across the world, to manage the animal health associated risks with monkeypox."" Separate advice  published by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC)  this week said that rodent pets belonging to monkeypox patients should ""ideally"" be isolated in monitored facilities and tested for the disease before their quarantine period ends. The animals should only be put down as a last resort in situations where isolation is not feasible, the document said.  Larger pets, such as dogs, could quarantine at home with regular checks on their health status.  Scientists say little is currently known about how monkeypox might behave in the domestic pet population.  But rodents and a particular species of squirrel are likely to be capable of catching and spreading the disease more easily than humans.  The ECDC says a ""spillover"" event, where a human infects a pet animal, could potentially lead to the virus establishing itself in European wildlife, although it describes the risk as ""very low"". The concern is that monkeypox could become what's known as an endemic zoonoses, where a disease jumps between animal species and is constantly present in that new population.

Monkeypox: Nigeria bans bushmeat to prevent virus spread,By Chris Ewokor,2022-06-02 16:56:09,"Six cases have been detected in the country this month bringing to 21 the number of confirmed infections this year, the authorities said. Experts say it is possible that the virus can be caught by eating meat from an infected animal. But this is not the most common transmission route. Monkeypox, a mild viral infection, is endemic in Nigeria.  It occurs mostly in remote areas, near tropical rainforests.  The country has had sporadic cases since an outbreak in 2017. The virus was found mainly in the south of the country but, since 2020, it has spread to central, eastern and northern areas, the World Health Organization says. Out of the 21 confirmed cases this year, there has been one reported death of a person who had underlying conditions. But earlier this week the health authorities said ""there has been no evidence of any new or unusual transmission of the virus, nor changes in its clinical manifestation documented"". What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Africa Live: More on this and other stories from the continent Scientists are struggling to explain a recent rise in monkeypox cases in Europe, which have not been linked to travel to the African countries where it is endemic. But there are suggestions the virus has been spreading from person to person for some time undetected. Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. Those infected in the UK have been advised to avoid having sex while they have symptoms. The animals that can pass on the virus are infected rodents, including rats and squirrels. According to health experts, this can happen if someone is bitten or touches an infected animal. Bushmeat refers to any wild animal that is killed for consumption, including antelopes, chimpanzees, fruit bats, rats, porcupines and snakes. In some remote areas of Nigeria it is a vital source of food, while in others it has become a delicacy. There are many bushmeat markets in Nigeria and it is unclear how the ban will be implemented. The ministry of agriculture also directed vets and its other officials to increase surveillance aimed at detecting any possible cases of monkeypox in animals. Operators of zoos, parks, conservation areas and recreational centres were reminded to make sure there was no contact between animals and humans",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61676841,The BBC

Monkeypox: First case confirmed in Northern Ireland,By Niall Glynn,2022-05-26 16:07:21,"It said to protect patient confidentiality, no further details about them will be disclosed. The PHA said the case was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases elsewhere in the UK. Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said he was ""fairly confident"" there will be more cases in Northern Ireland. According to the UK Health Security Agency, there are now 90 recorded cases in the UK as of Thursday afternoon. Eight additional cases have been detected in England, bringing the total there to 85. There are three confirmed cases in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland,  Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. Speaking at a briefing on Thursday afternoon, Dr Michael McBride said: ""What we want to do is to prevent this becoming established as an endemic infection in the United Kingdom because it isn't at this time. ""We have a very good chance of doing that by taking all the steps we are currently doing."" Dr McBride added that it ""certainly will not impact on daily life"" as it was not as transmissible between people. He added there was a ""very good chance to be able to interrupt and contain this"" but said they were ""having to play catch-up"". The chief medical officer said the type of monkeypox circulating in the UK was the West African variant which has a low mortality. Chief Scientific Officer Prof Ian Young said there was no evidence of any significant change in the virus or that it was a new variant of monkeypox. He said it is believed there may have been one or two super-spreader incidents of the virus, most likely in southern Europe which then continued out from there. Dr Gillian Armstrong, head of health protection at the PHA, said: ""The PHA has been working closely with trusts and GPs to raise awareness of the disease, and set up testing arrangements and clinical pathways. ""Cases of monkeypox are rare as the virus does not spread easily between people; therefore the risk to the Northern Ireland population is considered low. ""Appropriate public health actions are being taken and the PHA is working with the UK Health Security Agency to investigate any potential links with UK cases and we will contact any potential close contacts to provide health information and advice."" On contact tracing, Dr Armstrong said that skin to skin contact was the highest risk of spread, but household contacts would also be assessed as well people who may be caring for people with the virus such as health care workers.  She said as the virus could also be potentially be spread by bed linen towels the likes of hospital cleaners could also be potentially be considered. Earlier, the PHA said ""a notable proportion of recent cases in England and Europe have been found in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, so the PHA is particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned.  ""We can assure them their call will be treated sensitively and confidentially.  ""The PHA has been working with community and voluntary groups including Rainbow to raise awareness of monkeypox symptoms and action to take if you think you have been at risk of exposure.

Monkeypox: First case of outbreak confirmed in Wales,,2022-05-26 17:15:25,"Public Health Wales (PHW) said the case was being managed ""appropriately"" and no further details about the patient would be disclosed.  It added the overall risk to the general public was low. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) there were 79 cases reported of monkeypox in the UK as of Tuesday.  The UKHSA said it would update the totals later on Thursday.  Health Minister Eluned Morgan said contact tracing was under way. She added: ""The confirmation of this case in Wales is not unexpected in light of the developing situation in the UK and in a number of countries around the world."" What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Director of health protection for PHW, Dr Giri Shankar, said prior to this case being confirmed, PHW was working with the UKHSA, as well as public health agencies in Scotland and Northern Ireland, to respond to cases, and were well prepared for managing such incidents.  He added anyone with unusual rashes or legions on any part of their body should contact NHS 111, or call a sexual health service if they have any concerns.  Dr Shankar said: ""It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks, however, severe illness can occur in some individuals. ""In the current incident we are seeing presentations of cases mainly in gay, bisexual men, and men who have sex with other men, but nobody is immune from this infection so the message is for all the public but particularly for this group to be alert around any symptoms."" Later, he added: ""We have experience of managing monkeypox cases  including a couple of cases we had last year,  and that did not result in significant further spread.  ""However, this is an unusual event in terms of the numbers of cases we have seen in short period of time, this is why we are asking people to be vigilant, because the sooner we recognise the infection, the sooner we catch it and put in interventions, we can get on top of it."" Monkeypox is caused by a virus which comes from the same family as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low.  The viral infection usually occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests, and it is unusual to see cases in the UK. There are two main strains of virus - west African and central African.  PHW said initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring.  Symptoms usually take between five and 21 days to appear after infection, which usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.  Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through touching blisters, scabs or items such as bedding or clothing of someone with a monkeypox rash, as well as coughs and sneezes. It can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth.  It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be spread by contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rats and squirrels. Speaking to  Radio Wales Drive,  Dr Shankar said it was highly unlikely the monkeypox outbreak would result in parts of Wales being placed into lockdown, like during parts of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It's very important for everyone to be aware that the Covid infection causing virus is a completely different family of virus,"" he said. ""Monkeypox is a totally different virus. There are some commonalities - the way the virus behaves in humans is completely different in the case of monkeypox. ""So this anxiety of 'will this lead to lockdown?' is unfounded at this stage and we do not have any intelligence that the infection is progressing in that direction."" He added there was ""reasonable confidence"" in the risk assessment, but added ""we will definitely expect to see more cases getting confirmed before it starts to go down"". ""But I think we're confident at the current stage, given all the intervention we are suggesting, that monkeypox is highly unlikely to lead to lockdowns,"" he said. Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in west Africa.  Dr Giri Shankar from PHW said: ""At the moment the risk to the general public is low and we want to assure that people who have symptoms of monkeypox to come forward for testing or contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service."" UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness.

Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus , a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, but there have been unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region. Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the body. Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact with an individual with symptoms.  Statistics  showed there were two cases confirmed in the south west of England in the recent UK outbreak, up to 10 June, with a high proportion of cases in London residents. However, the first case of monkeypox in the UK was identified in Cornwall back in 2018, the UKHSA said.

Monkeypox added to notifiable diseases in Jersey,,2022-06-01 14:09:41.820000," There are currently no known cases of monkeypox in Jersey An order has been signed to make monkeypox a notifiable disease in Jersey. The Minister for Health and Social Services, Deputy Richard Renouf, signed the order.  The order will add monkeypox to the list of infectious diseases under the Public Health Act (1934). It means medical professionals are now required to notify the Medical Officer of Health should a case be detected.  The decision follows an outbreak of the virus in other countries. The risk of catching monkeypox in the UK and in Jersey remains low, and Islanders are being reassured there are currently no confirmed cases in Jersey or in the rest of the Channel Islands. Islanders are told they ""should be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia and to contact their GP or the sexual health service – initially by phone – if they have concerns"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gx01p424jo,The BBC
Monkeypox jab to be offered to at-risk gay and bisexual men,,2022-06-21 16:35:09,"This could help to control the recent outbreak of the rare virus in the UK in which 793 people have been infected so far. Monkeypox is not defined as a sexually-transmitted infection. But it can be passed on by close contact during sex, and with bedding, towels and skin.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says that a vaccine designed to protect against smallpox, called Imvanex, will help protect people who could be exposed to monkeypox.  The vaccine is effective against monkeypox because it is from the same family of viruses. Its use has been signed off by the UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox to get a new name, says WHO Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma Health officials say they are continuing to see ""a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men"". They say they hope rolling out vaccines to those at higher risk will ""break chains of transmission"". A doctor may now advise vaccination for someone who, for example, ""has multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues"", UKHSA says. At-risk men should not come forward for a vaccine until contacted.  More details are due to be set out shortly on how they can take up the offer. Watch  What Is Monkeypox?  on BBC iPlayer. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: ""By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. ""Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing."" If you have these symptoms, the advice is to avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre - but call ahead first. Alex Sparrowhawk, from Terrence Higgins Trust, said targeted vaccination ""is a positive move forward"" while the data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK. Robbie de Santos, from charity Stonewall, said: ""While we know anyone can catch monkeypox, we welcome the vaccine being offered to those gay and bi men who are eligible, who are currently at a higher risk of getting the virus. ""It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others.  ""Let's help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season,"" he added. The vaccine is already being offered to most healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox before being exposed, and to close contacts of confirmed cases within four days of exposure. More staff caring for monkeypox patients and workers in laboratories where the virus is being handled are also now being offered the vaccine. Of the 793 lab-confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK since early May, 18 were in Scotland, three were in Northern Ireland, six were in Wales and 766 were in England. Monkeypox virus is usually only seen in these numbers in areas of west and central Africa - but hundreds of countries outside of Africa have now seen outbreaks in recent weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61887631,The BBC
Monkeypox: How UK hospitals are tackling the outbreak,By Jim Reed,2022-05-26 00:09:10,"That's where a group of NHS hospitals - called the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) network - steps in. The early symptoms of monkeypox can be hard to diagnose - a fever, headaches or back pain, for example. Then a rash starts - often across the face then spreading to the hands, feet and other parts of the body. It is at that point a patient might go to their local sexual health clinic or GP. There a swab will be taken and sent to the rare and imported pathogens lab in Porton Down, run by the UK Health Security Agency. While that is being tested, most patients will be sent home to isolate and recover, and contact tracing teams will be brought in to identify others who might have been exposed. It's worth stressing that despite all the media attention, monkeypox is still extremely rare in the UK.  As of Thursday, only 90 people are known to have caught it here in the current outbreak - a fraction of the numbers in parts of West and Central Africa, where the disease is far more prevalent.  A small number may need hospital care.  ""Some people do get complications,"" says Dr Jake Dunning, who diagnosed the first travel-associated case of monkeypox in the UK back in 2018. He is a consultant in infectious diseases at London's Royal Free Hospital, which is treating some of the patients in the latest outbreak.  ""They can get secondary infections, they can have more painful lesions that require better control, and also there are some people with risk factors for disease progression. It's those people who we want to keep a close eye on in hospital too."" Knowing what those risk factors are in the UK population is difficult, because the data is still so limited. Based on what doctors know from Cameroon, the Central African Republic and other countries, younger children, pregnant women and people with a severely weakened immune system may be at greater risk of developing a more severe illness.  In parts of Africa, undiagnosed HIV is thought to be a complicating factor, although in the UK, with much greater access to antiretroviral drugs, that is likely to be less of an issue. The recent strain of monkeypox that has been reported in Europe and the US has had a 3% fatality rate in Nigeria, according to  the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . We don't know how that would convert to countries with much better-funded health systems. In England, patients developing complications, or in those higher-risk groups, are likely to be sent in a specialist ambulance to one of five dedicated centres: Sheffield, Newcastle, Liverpool or one of two London hospitals. The HCID network specialises in containing and treating imported illness from Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever to Ebola, as well as Sars and Mers, the more deadly precursors to the Covid outbreak.  ""It's down to having the physical facility and rooms which can safely isolate someone,"" says Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, who treated patients with monkeypox in earlier outbreaks.  ""Plus we have the training and the concentration of experts, so there will be teleconferences among the centres most days, just checking how the cases are doing and sharing expertise."" Those specialist doctors also conduct research, and have easier access to cutting-edge medicines. In the UK there are currently two main options if a patient has tested positive for monkeypox or thought to have been infected.  The first is to give a vaccine originally designed as an insurance policy just in case a related, but far more deadly disease, should ever start spreading again. In 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated globally, but the virus still exists in laboratories and there are long-standing contingency plans in case it should somehow get released either deliberately or by accident.  Research shows those same vaccines stockpiled by national governments can also protect well against monkeypox, even if given shortly after someone has already been exposed.  Once symptoms develop though, doctors say the jab is unlikely to have any effect and that is where a new generation of drugs could play a part. Dr Adler and his colleagues  recently published a paper in the Lancet medical journal  suggesting that the antiviral pill tecovirimat might help reduce illness from the virus. The data was based on just one patient treated in Liverpool in 2021, but did appear to show she had a shorter hospital stay and developed fewer lesions, or blisters, on her body, compared with other patients. ""If I were to see a severe case, I would be pushing for them to get early antiviral treatment and prioritising antiviral treatment for them,"" says Dr Adler. While the experimental use of antivirals has just started in Europe and the US, doctors say the real challenge will be to start clinical trials in parts of Africa where the need is greatest. Those UK patients admitted in this latest outbreak are likely to spend between between five days and a few weeks in hospital depending on their individual circumstances, doctors have told the BBC.  Those working in specialist hospital units rank the current outbreak as significant and surprising, but say monkeypox is much more straightforward to treat than Ebola, Mers, Lassa fever and other imported diseases that keep them awake at night. ""I never expected to see something of this magnitude, it just seemed so unlikely,"" says Dr Adler.  ""Those of us who were into monkeypox before it was cool, hoped our [research] paper would draw attention to the problem in Western and Central Africa, but we never thought it would be immediately relevant to patients in the UK and across Europe as well.""  on Twitter.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61569397,The BBC
Monkeypox: Cases outside Africa rise to 780 in three weeks,,2022-06-05 15:18:42,"That is roughly triple the 257 cases it reported a week ago. It says the figure - for the past three weeks - is probably an underestimate and assesses the global risk level as ""moderate"". The infection is usually mild, but this is the first time it has spread widely outside Central and West Africa. The WHO said cases had been identified in 27 countries where it is not already ""endemic"" - meaning places it is expected to be found.  Most of these new cases are in Europe and North America as well as small numbers in Mexico, Argentina, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. The UK has the most cases, with 207, followed by Spain with 156 and Portugal with 138. In its latest update, the WHO said some countries were reporting that new cases were appearing beyond known contacts of previously confirmed cases, which it said suggested chains of transmission were being ""missed through undetected circulation of the virus"". ""It is highly likely that other countries will identify cases and there will be further spread of the virus,"" it added. While the current risk to human health for the general public ""remains low"", the public health risk could ""become high"" if the virus becomes widespread in countries where it is not normally found, it said. No deaths have been reported as a result of the current outbreak. The global health body said most, but not all, of the reported cases so far have involved men who have sex with men. There is no evidence that monkeypox is sexually transmitted, but it is passed on through close contact. Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma Monkeypox cases rise as new UK sex advice issued The organisation said many cases were not presenting with the typical clinical picture for monkeypox, with some describing pustules appearing before symptoms such as fever. Most cases of the virus clear up on their own within a few weeks. Symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles, as well as a rash which goes through different stages. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in West Africa in the past.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61696974,The BBC
"Monkeypox to get a new name, says WHO",By Michelle Roberts,2022-06-14 16:34:10,"It comes after more than  30 scientists wrote last week  about the ""urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising"" name for the virus and the disease it causes.  Continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, they said. Some 1,600 cases of the disease have been recorded globally in recent weeks. While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected 32 countries, such as the UK.  At the latest count, as of 12 June, there were 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 4 in Wales. Watch  What Is Monkeypox?  on BBC iPlayer. The World Health Organization says it will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern - the highest alarm the UN agency can sound. The only other diseases this has happened for in the past are Swine flu, polio, Ebola, Zika and Covid.  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning.  ""For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern."" What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. One new name for it that's been suggested by scientists is hMPXV, but we'll need to wait to hear what the WHO thinks of that. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but the UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to guard against more cases.  The virus has been spreading in an unusual manner around the world in recent months. Previous outbreaks have been mainly confined to parts of Africa where rodents - not monkeys - are thought to be the main animal host. The infection  causes a rash  that looks a bit like chickenpox. The virus can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person.  It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact.

Monkeypox and gay men: Separating stigma from health advice,"By Lauren Moss, LGBT correspondent & Josh Parry, LGBT producer",2022-05-28 00:02:53,"Doctors and public-health experts have spoken to the BBC about the ""delicate balance"" of keeping those currently most at risk informed, without stigmatising them or letting others become complacent.  The short answer is no. Anyone can be infected by monkeypox.  The virus is not a sexually transmitted infection. It's mostly caught through close physical skin-to-skin contact, which is why it can be spread to sexual partners.  But with most confirmed cases among men who have sex with men, doctors are encouraging this group to be particularly alert to symptoms.  What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? How to tell if a rash might be monkeypox Monkeypox patients should avoid pet contact Mateo Prochazka, an epidemiologist from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ""The infections are not about sexuality. We are concerned about monkeypox in general, as a public threat. We are worried about everyone's health."" As monkeypox is often caught through direct contact, once it's introduced to a community, it is more likely to spread through that community among those who are in close contact with each other - for example, within a household or among sexual partners. Dr Prochazka says it's not clear why there is a higher proportion of cases among gay men.  He says: ""It just happens that the infection appears to have been introduced in networks of gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men. And this is where we're seeing most of the cases.""  There is a theory that a return of demand for international travel since Covid lockdowns were eased could have played a part in the initial spread.  But the person-to-person transmission that has been happening in countries outside western and Central Africa in recent weeks is new. Scientists are investigating whether the infection was introduced via a combination of single transmissions or, whether so-called ""super-spreader"" events, such as a festival, may have resulted in more people catching it at one time. Dr Prochazka says another possibility is that the proactive engagement of gay men with sexual-health services may have led to more cases being diagnosed. What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Gay and bisexual people were subject to stigma and homophobia following the Aids crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. Doctors and charities are keen to ensure this isn't repeated with monkeypox and are concerned it could also prevent others from realising they might have the virus. HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust is raising awareness alongside the UKHSA and NHS leaders to learn more about monkeypox and how it's affecting people. Alex Sparrowhawk, from the trust's health improvement team, says they're worried people might mistakenly regard monkeypox as a so-called gay disease and says everyone needs to be aware of the signs and symptoms. Jaime Garcia-Iglesias, a sociologist at the University of Edinburgh who has studied how Aids and Covid-19 affected certain communities, says there's a ""significant risk"" that the stigma ""comes to the surface again"" and might stop people from seeking the help they need.   Dating apps, such as Grindr, are also advising users about what to look out for.   Dr Prochazka says as case numbers are so small, experts aren't advising people to change personal behaviour but to be ""hyper-vigilant.""   He acknowledges the ""delicate balance between achieving freedom of choice and freedom of infection"" and says it's important people are well-equipped to make their own decisions. Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections, but they do not prevent monkeypox being transmitted.   Mr Sparrowhawk says people shouldn't be overly worried but if someone isn't feeling well and develops symptoms such as ""fever, headache, swollen lymph glands and a rash"" they should get in touch with their clinic for further advice.  If you don't have any symptoms and you're due to attend a regular sexual-health check-up, you're urged to go ahead as planned.  If you have a new and unusual sore or rash it's advised that you contact your local sexual-health clinic, but don't turn up for an in-person appointment unannounced. Those who are most at risk after coming into contact with a confirmed monkeypox case are urged to isolate at home for up to three weeks.   Most infections clear up on their own without any treatment but if you think you have monkeypox you're still urged to tell your doctor. As it can take three weeks for symptoms to appear, it's likely the number of diagnosed cases will grow.  And while the UKHSA acknowledges that the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"", it says the risk to people in the UK remains low. It's hoped the virus is rare enough that it can be contained. Dr Prochazka says when a new threat enters a network of people ""we do our best to suppress it. I think we are still at that stage where we can do that and really respond to this"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61609888,The BBC
Monkeypox outbreak mostly in young men in London,,2022-06-01 18:27:49,"Although anyone can contract the virus, 111 of 183 cases in England are in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. Monkeypox is not sexually transmitted but passed on through close contact - UK officials say no one factor linking the cases has been identified. LGBT groups and events are being urged to help share public health messages. People are being reminded to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. They should also limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible by phone. Symptoms are usually mild and clear up on their own within three weeks. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma Since the start of May, 183 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in England, four in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales - 190 in total. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has given more information on those affected in the current outbreak for the first time. The outbreak is unusual because not all cases are linked to travel with countries where monkeypox is always present, like west and central Africa. Instead, the virus is being passed from person to person in the UK. In England, 86% of those infected live in London and only two are women. Most are aged 20 to 49. The UKHSA said 18% of confirmed cases in England had recently travelled to a number of different countries in Europe, up to three weeks before they developed symptoms. The Covid conspiracies being recycled for monkeypox How UK hospitals are tackling monkeypox outbreak Health officials are contacting people who may be high-risk contacts of those cases, and advising some to isolate at home for up to 21 days. A vaccine against monkeypox, called Imvanex, is also being offered to some close contacts, such as healthworkers, to reduce the risk of them developing the infection or becoming ill. Scientists are no clearer to understanding what is behind the recent outbreak of monkeypox cases, but there are suggestions the virus has been spreading from person to person for some time undetected. UKHSA said links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad have been identified in some cases so far. It said it was working with the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) and the British HIV Association, the Terrence Higgins Trust, Stonewall and dating app Grindr, to communicate with sexual health services and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Professor Kevin Fenton, London regional director for public health said: ""Monkeypox can affect anyone but we know that many of the most recent diagnoses are in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, many of whom live in, or have links to London.  ""We're reminding everyone of the symptoms of monkeypox, and especially gay and bisexual men in particular, to be especially aware and seek advice immediately by calling NHS111 or their local sexual health clinic if they have concerns. He added: ""As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great.  ""This is why we're working side by side with the NHS, sexual health, voluntary and community sector organisations in London to share accurate information about monkeypox - especially to people and groups at increased risk - through representative voices."" Dr Meera Chand, from UKHSA, said she was ""grateful to everyone who has come forward for testing"". More than 30 countries worldwide outside of Africa have also been affected by similar outbreaks, and more than 550 confirmed cases of the viral disease have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO emergencies director, Dr Mike Ryan, warned that climate change was changing weather conditions, which was having an impact on animal and human behaviour, including food-seeking habits. As a result, he said, diseases which typically circulate in animals are increasingly jumping into humans. ""Unfortunately, that ability to amplify the disease and move it on within our communities is increasing - so both disease emergence and disease amplification factors have increased,"" Dr Ryan said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61660180,The BBC

They added: ""We would encourage people to be aware of the symptoms to look out for and to visit the  UK Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) website  for more information.""  Monkeypox cases rise to 71 in the UK Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? The UKHSA said many of the those infected so far had been gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men - and it asked these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms. Monkeypox is not a sexually-transmitted disease, and experts have stressed the illness does not affect one community more than any other, so there should be no stigma. The overall risk to the public is low despite the rise in cases amid the largest outbreak of monkeypox outside Africa, the UKHSA said.  Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of the body should contact NHS 111 or their local health service.

It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.

It is also continuing to work with the UKHSA, Public Health Wales and Northern Ireland HSC Health Protection Agency to monitor and respond to potential and confirmed cases in the UK.  There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, but a smallpox jab offers 85% protection as the two viruses are quite similar. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop - often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.

There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, but a smallpox jab offers 85% protection as the two viruses are quite similar. On Wednesday, Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service (SCTS) confirmed a  trial in Inverness had been adjourned  due to a witness being absent because of a suspected case of monkeypox. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop - often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. The disease, first found in monkeys, does not tend to spread easily between people but can be transmitted through close physical contact. That includes:  The UK Health Agency Security  advised people with the highest risk of having caught monkeypox to isolate  for 21 days. Monkeypox is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. Infections have been confirmed by public health agencies  in several European countries as well as the UK - where the first European case was reported on 7 May - and in Australia, the US and Canada. The World Health Organisation (WHO) described the recent outbreaks as ""atypical, as they are occurring in non-endemic countries"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61562865,The BBC
Monkeypox virus outbreaks are containable - WHO,,2022-05-23 18:21:12,"More than 100 cases of the virus - which causes a rash and a fever - have been confirmed in Europe, the Americas and Australia. That number is expected to rise still, but experts say the overall risk to the broader population is very low. The virus is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. ""This is a containable situation,"" the WHO's emerging disease lead Maria Van Kerkhove said at a news conference on Monday. ""We want to stop human-to-human transmission. We can do this in the non-endemic countries,"" she added - referring to recent cases in Europe and North America. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? The virus has now been detected in 16 countries outside Africa. Despite being the largest outbreak outside of Africa in 50 years, monkeypox does not spread easily between people and experts say the threat is not comparable to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Transmission is really happening from skin-to-skin contact, most of the people who have been identified have more of a mild disease,"" Ms Van Kerkhove said.  Another WHO official added that there was no evidence the monkeypox virus had mutated, following earlier speculation over the cause of the current outbreak. Viruses in this group ""tend not to mutate and they tend to be fairly stable"", said Rosamund Lewis, who heads the WHO's smallpox secretariat. Meanwhile, a top EU health official has warned that some groups of people may be more at risk than others. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" said Dr Andrea Ammon of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  ""However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners is considered to be high"". Monkeypox has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Dr Ammon suggested that countries should review the availability of the smallpox vaccine which is also effective against monkeypox. In the UK, which has now recorded 57 cases, authorities are advising anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed case to isolate for 21 days. A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with someone with monkeypox, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61553822,The BBC
Monkeypox: Three people vaccinated in Bristol and Exeter,,2022-05-27 17:18:42,"Two people from Exeter and one person in Bristol received a smallpox vaccine after potential exposure to the virus. Health bosses in the region are gearing up for an increase in cases and have made plans for community testing and potential hospital admissions. No confirmed cases have been identified yet in the South West. Stuart Walker, medical director of University Hospitals Bristol and Weston, said people had been potentially exposed to monkeypox elsewhere, and then had come back to the South West, according to the  Local Democracy Reporting Service . There have been a total number of 101 confirmed cases in England since 7 May. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus , a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. Speaking at a meeting of the hospitals' trust board on Friday, Prof Walker said health bosses were working through how to provide testing, vaccinations and prepare for potential hospital admissions if patients became seriously ill. Monkeypox case confirmed in Wales amid outbreak What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Smallpox vaccinations, which are used to vaccinate against monkeypox, are being administered in two centres in the South West, in Exeter and Bristol. Testing has been proposed to take place mainly in sexual health clinics, because of the link with cases. ""If we were to have individuals presenting with confirmed monkeypox, or a very probable case, there is a system in place for mostly managing patients in isolation at home,"" Prof Walker added. ""There hasn't been an individual yet in the UK who has had a very serious illness with monkeypox, but if admission were required that would currently be to Royal Free (Hospital in London) or Newcastle.""

Monkeypox: Two more people infected to take total to nine in UK,,2022-05-18 18:19:44,"Both live in the South East of England - where most of the cases have been identified - and it is thought they got the infection through spread in the community, rather than travel. Monkeypox is usually linked with travel to West Africa. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the virus does not usually spread easily and the risk to people is low. Most of the cases so far are in men who are gay, bisexual or who have sex with men.  What is monkeypox? UKHSA says people in these communities should be alert to unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through: All those diagnosed in the UK are in England and most are based in London, and  the city's public health director said plans were in place to stock up on treatments  in case infections rise further. Prof Kevin Fenton said treatments for monkeypox included vaccines and antiviral agents, and the current strategy was to ""vaccinate the highest priority people"", such as household contacts of those infected. ""We're watching closely to see how this spreads over the next week or two and then we'll get a better sense of how to project and plan for the month ahead,"" he added. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: ""These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities. ""UKHSA has quickly identified cases so far and we continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals."" Health officials are contacting anyone who is a close contact of those infected by monkeypox to provide health information and advice. Doctors are being asked to be alert to people coming forward with rashes without any clear diagnosis. Monkeypox signs can include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes - it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off. It is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61501679,The BBC
Got a new rash? Monkeypox or something else?,By Michelle Roberts,2022-05-24 23:19:47,"What are the things you should check and consider? The first thing to ask yourself is - do you think you could have been exposed? It takes close, prolonged contact - often skin-to-skin - with an infected person. There are very few people in the world who currently have it, meaning there are not that many opportunities to catch it.  Even in remote parts of some African countries where it can sometimes circulate, children rarely contract it.  If you were to get sick with monkeypox, the first thing you would notice is flu-like symptoms - feeling tired, generally unwell and feverish. It's what doctors call the ""invasion period"" of the disease, when the virus enters your cells.  Your glands would feel swollen because your immune system is ramping up to fight the infection. Next comes the rash, which goes through different ""skin eruption"" phases. It starts off flat and red, but then gets bumpy and blistered, before forming scabs. Dr Rosamund Lewis from the World Health Organization's Emergencies Programme explains: ""It starts with what we call macules. These are just red areas. Then it progresses to papules. This is something you can feel. It's raised."" Those red lumps and bumps then start to blister, and fill with a whitish fluid that looks like pus.  These pustules then begin to dry out and scab over. Eventually, the scabs will heal and drop off. ""This is why it can be confused with chickenpox,"" says Dr Lewis.  A monkeypox rash usually starts on the face - sometimes in the mouth too - and then the arms and legs, hands and feet, as well as the trunk of the body.    In some of the recent cases, the rash has often been around the genital area. Dr Lewis says: ""The rash may not be visible because it may be covered."" The rash - which may look slightly different on different skin tones - can contaminate bedsheets and clothes.  The advice from the UK Health Security Agency is to be aware of any unusual skin changes or lesions, especially around the genitals, and for people to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns. Dr Tanya Bleiker, President of the British Association of Dermatologists says: ""Differentiating between different types of rashes can be difficult. So if in doubt, follow the advice and get it checked."" What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer There are many possibilities, but some common ones include: This rash is usually very itchy and goes through similar stages, ending with scabs. It is possible to get chickenpox more than once in your life - adults can get it again, even if they had it as a young child.  Shingles - reactivation of the chickenpox virus - also causes a rash. It can appear in blotches, and is usually painful. Scabies is caused by mites that lay eggs in the skin, which make it very itchy and red. The rash can appear anywhere on the body, but often starts between the fingers. You might notice lines or tracks on the skin as well as dots. While it is not serious, it is very contagious and needs treating. You can get bitten by bedbugs if the bedding or mattress that you are sleeping on is infested with them. The bugs themselves are tiny, so you may not notice them. Like other insect bites, the lesions are itchy and red, and are often grouped in a line or cluster.  Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected, and genital herpes is a virus that can be sexually transmitted. Both can cause blisters. It's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible, if you think you might have an STI.  This itchy, stinging, red rash is a skin reaction to something that the body thinks is a threat and reacts to. Sometimes the trigger is never found, but common ones include eating certain foods or contact with certain plants, chemicals or medicines.  This common viral infection, often seen in children, is harmless but can spread around the body, causing itchy, firm, raised spots that have a small dimple in the middle. Clusters of them tend to occur in the armpit, behind the knees or in the groin. You can catch it from skin-to-skin contact or by touching contaminated objects, such as towels. This viral infection is spread by coughs and sneezes, as well as contaminated household items such as cutlery. It can cause flu-like symptoms, as well as sores in the mouth and a red rash on the palms and soles of the feet. It usually gets better on its own. This contagious bacteria usually infects skin that is already damaged, causing red sores and oozing, crusty blisters - often on the face. Although it can look severe, it can be cleared up with antibiotic cream.",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61551164,The BBC

Public Health Scotland said the case was not linked to international travel and the affected individual was exposed to the virus in the UK.   Details of the Scottish case were released as new guidance from the UK Health Agency Security  urged anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox to isolate  for 21 days.

""We are working with NHS boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.  ""Close contacts of the case are being identified and provided with health information and advice. This may include the offer of vaccination.""  There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, but a smallpox jab offers 85% protection as the two viruses are quite similar. Dr Phin said a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses had been ordered for the first Scottish case, adding that 10 to 20 contacts would be expected for each monkeypox patient. Public Health Scotland said the smallpox vaccines were being stored in Edinburgh and Glasgow but they were looking for locations suitable for a larger quantity of doses. The vaccine is stored at -80C to -20C, but can be kept in a fridge for up to eight weeks after thawing. Across the UK, 1,000 doses of the Imvanex vaccine have already been issued or are in the process of being issued, leaving more than 3,500 doses in the UK.  Dr Phin said the vaccines were not compulsory for contacts and there would not be a mass vaccination programme in a ""scenario like Covid"". He added: ""Anyone with an unusual blister-like rash or small number of blister-like sores on any part of their body, including their genital area, should avoid close contact with others and seek medical advice if they have any concerns."" A large proportion of the UK cases have been identified in gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with other men. Andy Seale, an adviser to the WHO, said: ""While we're seeing some cases in men, this is not a 'gay disease' as some people and social media have labelled it. ""It seems clear it's linked to close contact, whether through social contact or possibly sexual contact,"" he added in a social media session that was set up to answer questions from the public. An expert in infectious diseases said superspreader events were likely to be behind the recent rise in global cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of charitable health foundation Wellcome Trust, told  BBC Radio 4's Today  programme the trust had ""never seen anything like this before, with such a number of cases"" in so many countries. He said: ""The virus may have changed, but I think that's unlikely.  ""More likely is, I think, that the niche that this virus now finds itself in has allowed for some superspreader events and those individuals involved in that have then travelled to other parts of the world and taken the infection with them.""

Concern over monkeypox impact on sexual health So far, public health agencies in Europe have confirmed cases in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden. In a statement on Friday , the WHO said that the recent outbreaks ""are atypical, as they are occurring in non-endemic countries"". It said it was ""working with the affected countries and others to expand disease surveillance to find and support people who may be affected"". It is not yet clear why this unusual outbreak is happening now.  One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant.  Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive.  Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used.   WHO's Europe regional director Hans Kluge warned that ""as we enter the summer season... with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate"". He added that all but one of the recent cases had no relevant travel history to areas where monkeypox was endemic. The  first case of the disease in the UK  was reported on 7 May. The patient had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have caught the virus before travelling to England, the UK Health Security Agency said. There are now 20 confirmed cases in the UK, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Friday. Authorities in the UK said they had bought stocks of the smallpox vaccine and started offering it to those with ""higher levels of exposure"" to monkeypox. Spanish health authorities have also reportedly purchased thousands of smallpox jabs to deal with the outbreak, according to Spanish newspaper El País. Australia's first case  was detected in a man who fell ill after travelling to the UK, the Victorian Department of Health said.

The virus does not spread easily between people and the risk to the wider public is said to be very low. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told BBC Radio Scotland's  Lunchtime Live  programme it was very unusual for the virus to be present outside the animal world. He said: ""This is a virus that normally circulates in wildlife. We're not exactly sure what wildlife - it could be rodents, it could be monkeys. ""But occasionally when humans come into contact with an infected animal, you get human infections and sometimes you can get human-to-human infections."" The first-ever recorded occurrence of the virus in the UK was in 2018, and since then a handful of cases have been confirmed by health authorities. The latest case was being treated at an expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS trust in London after being identified last week.

In London, where most of the UK's 20 identified cases have been detected, sexual health clinics have stopped people walking in altogether.  The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the effect on other infections. Cases of monkeypox, which is generally mild, are rare outside Central and West Africa, but  about 80 cases have been confirmed in at least 12 countries,  the World Health Organization says.  Infections were confirmed in Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and Canada, as well as the UK - where the first European case was reported. The WHO says another 50 suspected cases are being investigated. What is monkeypox?  Time to worry or one to ignore? Eighty monkeypox cases confirmed in 11 countries Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. And the most recent UK cases are in gay or bisexual men which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. They are being asked to contact their local sexual health service if they have concerns. Dr Claire Dewsnap, a consultant in genitourinary medicine and president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said staff in sexual health clinics were ""already under significant pressure"" and monkeypox was making that situation worse. ""It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who's infected,"" Dr Dewsnap said. ""I am concerned about the potential impact on access to sexual health generally.""  In London, clinics are asking all patients to contact staff in advance and tell them their symptoms before being offered an appointment. This is so those with monkeypox symptoms can be kept away from waiting rooms or clinics where other people are present. Clinics elsewhere are asking only those with an unusual rash to call ahead so they can be seen in separate areas. Some staff in sexual health clinics have already received a smallpox vaccine to help protect them against monkeypox - a smallpox jab offers some good protection since the two viruses are quite similar. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link.  It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages - a bit like chicken pox - before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Read more  about the virus here. Twenty cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in the UK, with a further 11 announced on Friday, and most have been mild. However, the disease can be more severe, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems.   Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Friday that the UK was stocking up on smallpox vaccine doses to help protect some groups against the virus. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. Ten other countries, including the US, Portugal, Spain and Canada, have also detected cases.

Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""it is an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now ongoing transmission within certain communities"". He said that the key message to people with symptoms was to ""seek attention, get diagnosed and then to be isolated in some way at home so that they don't spread it on"". Asked how effective current treatments are, he said there was a post-exposure prophylaxis that can be given to close contacts and an anti-viral drug was also being tested in central Africa ""so there's a lot that can be done"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61527835,The BBC

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says many of the 71 people infected so far have been gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men - and it has been asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms.  But monkeypox is not a sexually-transmitted disease, and experts stress the illness does not affect one community more than any other, so there should be no stigma.  The virus, which is usually a mild infection, spreads through close contact with scabs on the skin, bedding and towels used by an infected person - and through their coughs and sneezes. The overall risk to the public is low, the UKHSA says, despite the rise in cases amid the largest outbreak of monkeypox outside Africa. So far in this outbreak, which started in early May, there have been 131 cases of monkeypox in more than 15 countries. Most are in Europe, where it is rarely seen, although there have been more than 1,200 cases in recent months in West Africa, where it is always present. In the UK, all the cases are in England, apart from one in Scotland. No cases have been found in Wales or Northern Ireland. More than 1,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvanex are being sent to NHS Trusts, and another 3,500 doses are in the UK.

Monkeypox: Two more confirmed cases of viral infection,,2022-05-14 10:10:32,"The individuals live together in the same household but are not linked to the  previous case  announced on 7 May. Of the two new cases, one was receiving care at St Mary's Hospital in London and the other was isolating, the agency said. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection from which most people recover in a few weeks, according to the NHS. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced on 7 May that a person who had recently travelled to Nigeria had contracted the infection. It was believed they contracted the illness in Nigeria before travelling to the UK. They were being treated at the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, the agency said. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infection at the UKHSA, said the two new monkeypox cases were not linked to the case announced on 7 May. ""While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person,"" he said. ""The overall risk to the general public remains very low."" What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox case confirmed in England Health worker diagnosed with monkeypox Dr Brown said the agency was contacting ""any potential friends, family or contacts in the community"" as well as ""healthcare contacts"" of the two new cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, which usually starts on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off.

High-risk monkeypox contacts advised to isolate,By Christy Cooney & Adam Durbin,2022-05-23 14:31:00,"The UK Health Security Agency advice  is for anyone who has direct or household contact with a confirmed case. Contacts are advised to provide their details for contact tracing, forgo travel, and avoid contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and children under 12. The UK has confirmed 21 cases, with the  first case in Scotland  on Monday.  More than 80  have also been identified  across Europe, the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As things stand the judgement is that it's rare. I think we're looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. ""It hasn't yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country. ""The UK Health Security Agency - a new body - is obviously following it very closely."" Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of central and west Africa. The disease, first found in monkeys, does not tend to spread easily between people but can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse. Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks.  A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).  Other people who may have come into contact with a case do not need to stay at home and isolate, but should watch out for symptoms such as fever and a rash. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Although there has been a small number of deaths attributed to the virus in west and central Africa since December, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, none have been  reported by the World Health Organisation  in other countries where cases have been found.  Monkeypox detected in three more countries What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?  Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking to the BBC, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said community transmission was occurring in the UK.  ""We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country,"" she said. The UKHSA has said a notable proportion of early cases has been detected in gay and bisexual men and has urged members of those communities in particular to be alert.  The cases have also been largely concentrated in urban areas.  ""We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash,"" said Dr Hopkins. Dr Hopkins added close contacts of cases were being given an established smallpox vaccine that can help protect against monkeypox.  ""We're not using [the vaccine] in the general population,"" she said. ""We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms, and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ""For contacts, [this] reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point."" Smallpox vaccines are about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection, and several countries have said they have begun stockpiling them.  It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation could be the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Director of the Wellcome Trust Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC there may have been a ""superspreader"" event where people gathered and picked up the infection and then took it home with them to different countries. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. Prof Tom Solomon, from the University of Liverpool's Pandemic Institute, said scientists were ""not too alarmed"" by the number of cases, adding he was not aware of there ever being a monkeypox death in the UK. The public health expert told BBC Breakfast he would not be surprised if infections were to double when new figures were released later on Monday - because they are now being actively looked for. Prof Solomon said: ""This is a very mild disease, if you didn't look for it you probably wouldn't even know that it had been occurring. So the numbers will go up. ""But the important thing is by identifying those cases we can isolate them, and isolate their contacts to stop the spread."" This monkeypox outbreak is undoubtedly unusual as this kind of spread has not been seen before. But that does not mean we are repeating Covid.  Monkeypox is a known virus rather than the completely new coronavirus and we already have tools to help control it.  The big challenge at the moment is we have no idea how many cases are out there. We know we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg because many of the new cases appear unconnected to each other. So we should expect the numbers of confirmed cases to continue to rise. Monkeypox: How worried should we be? The World Health Organization has said it is ""working with the affected countries and others to expand disease surveillance to find and support people who may be affected"". Its head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said  the world was facing ""formidable"" challenges,  including Covid, the war in Ukraine and monkeypox. Asked about the outbreak on Sunday, US President Joe Biden said the spread of the virus was ""something that everybody should be concerned about"" and the US was ""working hard"" on its response.",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61546480,The BBC
UK monkeypox cases double to 20 - Sajid Javid,By Michelle Roberts,2022-05-20 11:36:42,"The new cases come on top of the nine already identified in the country. Mr Javid said ""most cases"" are mild. He has now updated G7 health ministers on the spread of the virus, which has been detected in nine other countries outside Central and West Africa.  He said the UK was stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against monkeypox. ""I can confirm we have procured further doses,"" he said. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar.  The World Health Organization is convening an emergency meeting with experts about the spread.  Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, is concerned that transmission could accelerate as countries enter the summer ""festival"" season.  Cases of the disease outside Central and West Africa are rare, but some have been occurring recently in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia.  It is not clear how much vaccine stock has been bought by the UK, or how many jabs might be given.  Reports say Spain is preparing to order thousands of doses of smallpox vaccine to use against monkeypox.  Even without a vaccine, most cases clear up on their own within a few weeks. Severe cases sometimes can occur though. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link.  It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages - a bit like chicken pox - before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Read more  about the virus here. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the risk to the public remains very low.  Anyone with concerns that they could be infected should see a health professional, but make contact with the clinic or surgery ahead of a visit. NHS 111 can also give advice. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Her colleague, Prof Kevin Fenton, said: ""We are asking everybody to be aware of the signs and symptoms, which include rashes around the mouth as well as around the genital area."" The  Imvanex smallpox vaccine  is about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, studies suggest. Vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe. Vaccines work by teaching the immune system how to defend itself against a disease. Routine smallpox vaccination ended in the 1970s in Britain, around the time the disease was eradicated, meaning many people have not got any protection or immune memory against these types of viruses.

Monkeypox: Plans in place to stock up on treatments if infections rise,,2022-05-18 17:46:31,"Nine people have been diagnosed with the virus in the UK, with nearly all of those based in London. Prof Kevin Fenton said health experts were watching the situation closely to see whether infections spread. He added it was a ""very, very rare condition"", but they wanted to raise awareness among those at risk. What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to West Africa. Symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, aches and exhaustion, although experts say the chances of infection are low. On Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said another two cases had been identified in England - one in London and the other in the South East - with neither having links to those previously found. Two days before, the health body revealed  four cases of the virus had been detected in addition to three others previously found , with all of those people appearing to have been infected in London. Speaking before the latest two cases were revealed, Prof Fenton told  BBC Radio London  there were ""three different cases we're seeing in the city"", and ""we're really trying to raise awareness"" among people who could be at risk to ""get checked out"". He explained: ""One is a person who returned from West Africa and may well have contracted the infection while they were there.  ""There's a cluster in a family, a heterosexual family... we haven't found any travel links as of yet, which could suggest that they may have picked up the infection in some contact here. ""And there's another cluster of gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men and they have all reported no history of travel."" Prof Fenton said treatments for monkeypox included vaccines and antiviral agents, and the current strategy was to ""vaccinate the highest priority people"", such as household contacts of those infected. But he added: ""If we see more cases and it continues to spread then there are plans in place to ensure we have more antiviral agents in place to deal with that. ""We're watching closely to see how this spreads over the next week or two and then we'll get a better sense of how to project and plan for the month ahead."" Dr Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser, previously said the group was ""rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.

Monkeypox: UK discovers 36 more cases,By Michelle Roberts,2022-05-23 16:59:27,"Adding in a new case found in Scotland on Monday, it brings the total number of infections in the UK to 57.  The rare virus - which causes a rash and a fever - has been seen around the world in recent weeks, which is unusual. Health experts stress that the overall risk remains low, and that the disease can be contained.  Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency  and  Public Health Wales  each said they have had no confirmed cases. Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London has said ""around 10"" staff in its sexual health clinic are self-isolating at home after coming into close contact with a patient with monkeypox.   Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, told the BBC that ""up to 10 staff"" at a second sexual health clinic were also self-isolating. The location has not been revealed. Clinics have now brought in stringent Personal Protective Equipment requirements when dealing with the virus. About 100 confirmed cases have been recorded globally so far. The World Health Organization's (WHO) emerging disease lead Maria Van Kerkhove said we should expect to see more in the coming days, but that we have the tools to stop the virus.  ""This is a containable situation, particularly in the countries where we are seeing these outbreaks that are happening across Europe, in North America as well,"" she said. ""We can stop human-to-human transmission.""  The virus does not usually spread easily between people, but it can be passed on through close person-to-person contact. That includes: Dr Susan Hopkins, from the UKHSA, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes, or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms. ""A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms,"" she said.  What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Time to worry or one to ignore? Andy Seale, an adviser to the WHO, said: ""While we're seeing some cases in men, this is not a 'gay disease' as some people and social media have labelled it. ""It seems clear it's linked to close contact, whether through social contact or possibly sexual contact,"" he added in a social media session that was set up to answer questions from the public.  Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox - those who live with someone who has it, for example - will be asked to isolate at home for up to 21 days,  in line with official guidelines. The government has confirmed that it has  bought supplies of a smallpox vaccine,  and this is being offered to identified close contacts of anyone diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Most cases will be mild and get better within a few weeks. If you become infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. They include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.

Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore?,By James Gallagher,2022-05-20 23:24:05,"So what is going on? Is it time to worry or are we getting overly excited having just lived through Covid? Let's be clear: this is not another Covid and we're not days away from lockdowns to contain the spread of monkeypox.  However, this is an unusual and unprecedented monkeypox outbreak. It has taken scientists who specialise in the disease by complete surprise and it is always a concern when a virus changes its behaviour. Until now, monkeypox was pretty predictable.  The virus's natural home is wild animals, which are actually thought to be rodents rather than monkeys. Somebody in the rainforests of Western and Central Africa comes into contact with an infected creature and the virus makes the jump across species. Their skin erupts in a rash, which blisters and then scabs over.  The virus is now outside its usual home and struggles to spread so it needs prolonged close contact to keep going. So outbreaks tend to be small and burn out on their own.  Small numbers of cases have cropped up elsewhere in the world before,  including the UK , but all can be immediately linked to somebody travelling to an affected country and bringing it home.  That is no longer the case.  ""We're in a very new situation, that is a surprise and a worry,"" Prof Sir Peter Horby, the director of the University of Oxford's Pandemic Sciences Institute, told me. While he says this is ""not Covid-Two"", he said ""we need to act"" to prevent the virus getting a foothold as this is ""something we really want to avoid"". Dr Hugh Adler, who has treated patients with monkeypox, agrees: ""It's not a pattern we've seen before - this is a surprise."" We know this outbreak is different, but we don't know why.  There's two broad options - the virus has changed or the same old virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive.  Monkeypox is a DNA virus so it does not mutate as rapidly as Covid or flu. Very early  genetic analysis  suggests the current cases are very closely related to forms of the virus seen in 2018 and 2019. It is too early to be sure, but for now there is no evidence this is a new mutant variant at play. But a virus doesn't have to change in order to take advantage of an opportunity, as we have learned from unexpected large outbreaks of both Ebola and Zika virus in the last decade.  ""We always thought Ebola was easy to contain, until that wasn't the case,"" said Prof Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  It's not clear why gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected. Are sexual behaviours making it easier to spread? Is it just coincidence? Is it a community that is more aware of sexual health and getting checked out?  It may also be getting easier for monkeypox to spread. The mass smallpox vaccinations of the past would have given older generations some protection against the closely related monkeypox.  ""It is probably transmitting more effectively than in the smallpox era, but we're not seeing anything suggesting it could run rampant,"" said Dr Adler, who still expects this outbreak to burn itself out. Understanding how this outbreak started will help predict what happens next.  We know we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg as the cases being detected don't fit into a neat picture of this person passed it on to that person etc. Instead many of the cases appear unrelated, so there are missing links in a chain that seems to spread across Europe and beyond.  A recent massive superspreading event, in which large numbers of people gathered and caught monkeypox at the same venue such as a festival and then took it home to different countries, could explain the current situation. The alternative explanation for so many unconnected people getting infected is if the virus has actually been bubbling along unnoticed for quite some time involving a lot of people.  Either way, we can expect to continue to find more cases.  ""I don't think the general public need to be worried at this stage, but I don't think we've uncovered all of this and we are not in control of this,"" said Prof Jimmy Whitworth, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  But remember we are not in the same situation as we were with Covid.  Monkeypox is a known virus rather than a new one, and we already have vaccines and treatments. It is mostly mild, although it can be more dangerous in young children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems.  But it spreads more slowly than Covid and the distinctive and painful rash makes it harder to miss than a cough that could be anything. This makes the job of finding people who may have been infected and vaccinating those at risk of catching it easier.  However, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that ""as we enter the summer season... with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate"".

"World faces big challenges over Covid, monkeypox and wars - WHO",,2022-05-23 01:29:54,"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was speaking in Geneva, where the UN health agency's experts were discussing the monkeypox outbreak in 15 nations outside Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and Israel. However, the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Monkeypox - the virus that is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa - does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild.  Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according to  the UK's National Health Service . The outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, and UK health officials have issued new advice,  saying high-risk contacts of cases should self-isolate for three weeks . Belgium became the first country to announce a three-week quarantine for infected persons on Friday. More confirmed cases are expected to be announced in the UK on Monday, the Guardian newspaper reports. What is monkeypox?  Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking at Sunday's opening of his agency's World Health Assembly, Dr Tedros said: ""Of course the [Covid] pandemic is not the only crisis in our world.  ""As we speak our colleagues around the world are responding to outbreaks of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, monkeypox and hepatitis of unknown cause and complex humanitarian crises in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen.  ""We face a formidable convergence of disease, drought, famine and war, fuelled by climate change, inequity and geopolitical rivalry,"" the WHO head added.  The WHO earlier said that a number of other suspected monkeypox cases were being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections were likely to be confirmed. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. Further cases were confirmed in Austria and Switzerland on Sunday. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus was now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have had no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said.

Monkeypox: Cases detected in three more countries for first time,,2022-05-24 20:44:24,"The Czech Republic and Slovenia also reported their first cases on Tuesday, joining 18 other countries to detect the virus outside its usual Africa base. That number is expected to rise further still, but experts say the overall risk to the general population remains low. Outbreaks of the virus have been found in Europe, Australia and America. The symptoms often include a fever and rash - but the infection is usually mild. In the UAE, health officials announced a case had been detected in a traveller who had recently visited west Africa and is now receiving medical treatment. Authorities there say they are ""fully prepared"" to handle any outbreak, adding that early surveillance protocols for detecting the disease were in place. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus can be contained with the right response in countries outside of Africa where it is not usually detected. ""We encourage you all to increase the surveillance of monkeypox to see where transmission levels are and understand where it is going,"" the WHO's director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, Sylvie Briand, said at a conference on Tuesday. The outbreaks may not be normal but remain containable, she added. What is monkeypox?  Time to worry or one to ignore? Outside Africa there are now 237 confirmed and suspected cases of monkeypox and health authorities around the world have announced plans to contain the virus. Germany says it has ordered up to 40,000 doses of the Imvanex vaccine - used to treat smallpox, but also effective against monkeypox - to be ready in case the outbreak worsens. Anyone already vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine years ago as part of a global bid to eradicate the disease should have existing immunity, German health officials said. But they added that the older treatment has more side-effects so is not suitable for fighting monkeypox today. And in France, which has detected three cases, officials announced a targeted vaccination campaign of adults who had been recently exposed. Authorities there are recommending that a vaccine be given within four days of exposure, but up to 14 days afterwards if necessary.  In England, officials announced on Tuesday that 14 more cases of the virus had been detected - bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 71. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases which have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link.  It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear.

The WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that ""transmission could accelerate"" during the summer season, as people gather for festivals and parties. In addition to the European cases, Australia has confirmed that one man who had travelled to the UK contracted the virus. In North America,  health authorities in the US state of Massachusetts  said one man who recently travelled to Canada had tested positive for the virus. Canada's Public Health Agency said it had identified  two cases in Quebec , but said it was not clear if the US traveller had been infected before or during his visit to Montreal.

Monkeypox diagnosed in UK for first time,,2018-09-08 17:19:49,"The rare viral infection does not spread easily between humans and most people recover within a few weeks. Public Health England (PHE) said the patient was a resident of Nigeria where the virus was probably contracted. The patient had been staying at a naval base in Cornwall but is now being treated at the infectious diseases unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Its experts are working closely with NHS colleagues ""as a precautionary measure"" and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice. This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. The patient travelled to London from Nigeria on 2 September and anyone who has not been contacted yet from that flight is advised no further action is required.

""We have worked with multi-agency colleagues, following tried and tested protocols and procedures, and identified all close contacts. Actions have been put in place to minimise the likelihood of further infection."" The monkeypox virus is a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low.  It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests.  There are two main strains of virus - west African and central African. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles and a general listlessness. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in west Africa.

LGBTQ+ groups unite to urge UK ministers to act against monkeypox,,2022-08-05 07:44:00,"LGBTQ+ groups from across the political spectrum have joined forces to demand the government increase  efforts to combat monkeypox  or risk it becoming endemic in the UK. There have been more than 2,600 cases of monkeypox in the UK so far, which in the majority of the cases affects gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The US on Thursday declared a public health emergency over the virus, which followed the World  Health  Organization (WHO) last month calling it a global emergency. UK health authorities have urged calm, but now groups in Westminster have called on the health secretary, Steve Barclay, to take action due to monkeypox “causing real fear and anxiety”. “We are united as LGBT+ groups from across political parties in asking that the government treat the monkeypox outbreak as a public health emergency,” a letter to Barclay signed by the LGBTQ+ groups for the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Scottish National party said. “We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.” The letter, which was also signed by sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the government must prioritise communication and vaccination. “We need clear, non-stigmatising messaging, delivered direct to GBMSM about the symptoms of monkeypox and what to do if you suspect you have the virus to inform and reassure people (rather than the current broadcast-to-all approach that constantly mentions GBMSM),” the authors, who included the Tories’ Luke Black and Matthew Lloyd of Labour, stated. “Messaging must reach communities at high risk of acquiring monkeypox, through targeted messaging on apps, online and in the queer media. Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK,” they added. “We are very worried that, while mass vaccination events are a great way of building confidence that vaccinations are happening, they can be a driver of inequality, especially when there is an under-supply of jabs,” Lloyd said separately. “It is time to get improved systems and more purchasing of this much-needed vaccine.” The Terrence Higgins Trust also called for improvements to the vaccination effort. The charity’s head of policy, Ceri Smith, said: “We need urgent political action to get a grip on the UK’s rapidly rising number of monkeypox cases. “That’s why we’re grateful to the LGBT+ groups from the different political parties uniting to call for a public health response that’s proportionate to the size of the problem while gay and bisexual men continue to make up the vast majority of cases. “We need to see far better coordination, increased vaccine procurement, improved delivery and a cash injection to sexual health services to treat monkeypox that will also reverse the impact the outbreak is already having on STI testing and treatment, PrEP provision and contraception services.” The NHS announced late last month that it was stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab became available. Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Thousands of monkeypox vaccines have already been administered and the NHS is working to rapidly invite those at greatest risk. We have procured over 150,000 vaccines, and we’re working with partners – including the NHS and UK Health Security Agency – to share targeted, non-stigmatising communications with the LGBTQ+ community. “We are enabling local authorities to invest in essential frontline sexual health services by providing more than £3.4bn through the public health grant.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox,The Guardian
"Monkeypox showing signs of plateauing in UK, say health officials",Geneva Abdul,2022-08-06 13:28:00,"The monkeypox outbreak in the UK is showing signs of plateauing, the UK  Health  Security Agency has said.  The organisation said there had been 2,859 confirmed and highly probable cases of the viral disease as of 4 August, the majority of which are transmitted between men who have sex with men. Despite recent figures suggesting the outbreak has slowed, the agency’s director said “we cannot be complacent”. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice,” said Meera Chand, the director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA. Within England, the majority of cases have been in London. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK is 37, and 99% of all UK cases are male. The smallpox vaccine is being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox, according to the agency, in efforts to protect individuals and reduce the spread of the disease. Last month a vaccination drive was launched as sexual health campaigners warned health authorities were underestimating the scale of the response required to stop monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK. As cases surpassed 2,000, public health officials ordered 100,000 more doses of vaccine. The news of UK cases plateauing comes as parts of the  US brace  for the viral disease, where it has already been  declared a public health emergency  by the president, Joe Biden, after New York City, San Francisco and other cities announced a state of emergency. The global monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern  by the World Health Organization  (WHO) last month. It was the seventh time such a declaration has been made since 2009, the most recent being for Covid-19. The WHO later advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/monkeypox-showing-signs-plateauing-uk-health-officials,The Guardian
Gay community braces for monkeypox as outbreak spreads in US,Eric Berger,2022-08-05 10:00:00,"Earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, members of the gay and bisexual men’s social group  Prime Timers St Louis , were “very, very worried” about Covid-19 because of underlying health conditions, said Bob Brinkman, 69, president of the group. That includes HIV, among other issues that compromised their immune systems. But the group’s 141 members got vaccinated against Covid, he said, and in June, Prime Timers held its monthly potluck for the first time in more than two years. Now the gay community in St Louis and elsewhere in the US have another health threat to worry about: monkeypox, a viral disease that has primarily affected men who have sex with men – but can infect anyone – and caused New York,  California  and Illinois to declare a public health emergency. Other cities and states across the US are bracing and preparing for its impact also, both within the LGBTQ community and more broadly. On Thursday the White House declared monkeypox a national public health emergency, triggering more resources especially around vaccines. “It will have a continual impact on my intimate side of life,” said Brinkman, who lives in a St Louis suburb and is retired after working in information technology. “I don’t have anybody in my life right now, and to try to meet somebody on that level, it raises a big concern, and I think a lot of people are thinking about that too.” But while infectious disease experts urge men who have sex with men in cities, like St Louis, not yet hit hard by monkeypox to educate themselves on the disease, they also warn against panic, an understandable reaction for a demographic that was torn apart by the Aids epidemic. “I think it would be safe to say that this could be stressful for individuals, on top of two and a half years of incredible stress,” said Dr Preeti Malani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Michigan. “People should be worried but not to the point where they are not able to move forward with their lives.” The virus can cause fever, headaches and a painful rash, among other symptoms, but is rarely fatal. It’s primarily spread through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, such as during sex,  according to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The United States had recorded more than 6,300 cases of monkeypox by Wednesday, almost half of which have occurred in New York, California and Illinois,  according to  the CDC. But most states have reported fewer than 100 cases.  Missouri  has reported 10. Cities such as St Louis “should be prepared to see infections transmitted among men who have sex with men and then eventually spilling over into other social networks as well”, Jay Varma, the director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response, said. “It’s very hard to say whether or not this will be large outbreaks or whether it might be just a few cases.” That will depend on the availability of vaccines and the effectiveness of testing and contact tracing efforts, Varma said. There is only enough vaccine supply in the United States to cover about a third of the estimated 1.6 million gay and bisexual men whom officials consider at highest risk, and the shortage could last for months, the Washington Post reported . To promote vaccination and information on the virus, Malani said, public health agencies should collaborate with trusted community organizations such as the University of Michigan’s Spectrum Center, which in 1971 became the first office for queer students at a US university. The group now works with the school’s public health department and the county health agency and is preparing messaging for when students return later this month, Malani said. “That’s an example of going to the organizations, the grassroots, the community centers, the individuals who have clout and are visible and are good partners,” said Malani. Public health officials should also use “non-traditional locations” such as bars, restaurants and bathhouses to provide information about the virus. On Monday afternoon, a steady stream of customers entered Club St Louis, which is part of a chain of private men’s saunas. On its website  homepage , the company offers advisories regarding Covid and monkeypox. “The first step in controlling MONKEYPOX is to seek out as many cases as possible, learn how the disease is transmitted, and what the symptoms are,” the alert states. “It’s important to get treatment for those infected and to vaccinate those who are potentially exposed, and to ensure that our at-risk community knows what is happening.” David Williams, a 49-year-old hairdresser, and a friend visiting from out of town came to the pool. “Apparently gay men are the only ones having sex any more in America,” Williams joked of the virus’s primary spread. Williams, who is HIV positive but protected from transmitting the virus because of medication, had already received a monkeypox vaccine from a county health department in  Illinois . Still, when asked whether the threat of monkeypox had caused him to change his lifestyle, Williams, who is divorced and single, said, “absolutely”. “No sex,” he said. “Until more people get vaccinated.” But the message from public health officials to gay men should not be, “Just don’t have sex,” Varma said. “Whenever we talk about sex, we as healthcare providers always need to recognize that sex has health benefits, and it brings joy to people’s lives,” said Varma. “That said, you also need to be realistic and honest about where risk is right now. And at the moment … the highest risk is from either anonymous sex partners and/or sex-related events where people are having sex with multiple partners, so it is wise for men who have sex with men to be thinking about what their risk tolerance is.” AJ Pupillo, a 45-year-old St Louis county resident who acts as a caretaker for his parents, had not yet given much thought to monkeypox. Pupillo, who is HIV positive but also cannot transmit the virus, said he trusted Vivent Health, an HIV treatment organization with an office in St Louis, to provide  information  and care he could need regarding monkeypox. “I know I’m in good hands,” said Pupillo. Brinkman, the president of Prime Timers, said the organization would probably continue gathering because monkeypox is much less contagious and is spread differently than Covid. “It might have some affect,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s going to force us back to Zoom.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/monkeypox-outbreak-us-gay-community,The Guardian
Rightwing media embraces Aids-era homophobia in monkeypox coverage,Wilfred Chan,2022-08-10 11:00:00,"openly mock monkeypox victims This aggressive stigmatization of monkeypox – reminiscent of the homophobic response to HIV/Aids in the 1980s – poses a serious challenge to public health advocates and community leaders trying to have honest conversations about the disease with the gay and bisexual men who are most at risk during the current outbreak. Should public messaging highlight the fact that monkeypox is primarily affecting men who have sex with men? And should public health bodies urge gay men to change their sexual practices? The simultaneous threats of homophobia and monkeypox require making a difficult choice about which to tackle first, says the writer and veteran Aids activist  Mark S King , a 61-year-old gay man. “I’m about killing the alligator closest to the boat. And right now that means getting information to men who have sex with men about how to avoid this.” Early in the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) struck a cautious note in its communications about monkeypox, which causes painful lesions, fever, and other symptoms. On 18 May, the agency said that “cases include individuals who self-identify as men who have sex with men” while stressing “anyone, regardless of sexual orientation” could spread the disease. But an  international study  published on 21 July found 98% of recent Monkeypox cases outside of Africa were found in gay or bisexual men, with transmission suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of those cases. That’s why King is aligned with an increasing number of US public health officials and advocates who believe the messaging around monkeypox needs to be brutally honest in communicating the risks to the population most affected – even if homophobes are going to pounce on it. Last week, the CDC  appointed  Dr Demetre Dasklakis, a gay man and renowned Aids activist, as the deputy coordinator of its national monkeypox response. Days later, the agency published  guidance  for preventing monkeypox through safer sex that includes an illustration of two men in a bed. The article recommended people limit their number of sex partners, avoid anonymous hookups, and “wash your hands, fetish gear, sex toys” after having sex. It also suggested socially distanced or video masturbation as alternatives to sex. Sex-positive public health messages like these have drawn scorn from conservative commentators. “Chastity. Celibacy. Modesty. Disciplined. Not being gross. Keeping your legs closed. All viable options, people,” tweeted the Republican commentator Kathy Barnette in response to the CDC’s guidance. “Still waiting for gay men who are having random sex with strangers during the  Monkeypox  outbreak to get lectured and scolded by public health authorities the way that the rest of us did for going to grocery stores and restaurants during Covid,” tweeted the Daily Caller’s Matt Walsh. And in late July, Fox News’s Tucker Carlson tweeted a poll declaring that the disease should be renamed “schlong Covid”, tagging the CDC. But King says these rightwing attacks are just a distraction. “We have to ignore that if we are to deliver an effective public message to the community that we care about.” King contracted HIV in 1985 and remembers feeling frustrated over the lack of official acknowledgment of the toll on gay men. “How many years was it until our president said how many people died of Aids, before there was detailed, explicit language on how the virus was transmitted?” he says. “Fast forward to 2022, where we are at least getting all of this great, explicit information out about monkeypox so that gay men can protect themselves. I consider that progress.” But not everyone in the queer community agrees on how to talk about the new outbreak. The prominent rights group Glaad has notably cautioned against framing monkeypox as a disease that primarily affects men who have sex with men in  guidance  issued to the media.  Framing monkeypox as a disease within the gay community will discourage other people from educating themselves on prevention, says DaShawn Usher, the director of communities of color and media at Glaad. “If history has shown us anything, it would show us that a communicable disease like this doesn’t stay within one community,” he said. “Stigma drives fear, and fear then becomes resistance to public health and stopping the spread of the disease.” Usher says the belief that monkeypox only affects some people might also discourage employers from offering accommodations for monkeypox, or prevent workers from disclosing that they have monkeypox for fear of being labeled or outed as queer. There is also disagreement within the queer community about whether and how to discuss changing sexual behavior during the outbreak. Some health authorities’ suggestions that affected communities scale back their sexual activity while the US grapples with  vaccine delays  can sound uncomfortably similar to conservative attacks on gay culture. Usher says that just telling people to abstain from sex would send the wrong message. “You could still contract monkeypox if you were to kiss someone that had an active case of monkeypox, or if you cuddled with someone without clothes on. I would just encourage people to understand all of the ways that it could be spread.” King says he has received pushback within his community for telling others to consider dialing back their hookups. “I’m getting attacked by people who think that I’m contributing to the stigmatization of gay sex. My response to that is: you’re welcome to go back to whatever kind of sexuality suits you in a few weeks. The vaccines are on the truck. Give it a minute.” The activist believes the best way to offer frank public health advice about sex is to remove any moral judgment. “We’ve learned through the last 40 years of HIV that moral judgments only help HIV,” he says. “Moral judgments shame the people who are most at risk, which leads to people going underground, not admitting what their behaviors are, and not wanting to talk about the risks.” That’s not to say there isn’t room to discuss why gay men make the choices they do, King says. “But right now it is a completely worthless conversation when it comes to stopping the spread of monkeypox.” King says it’s a mistake to think that avoiding the realities of monkeypox will reduce homophobic aggression – which has been increasing for many years. The number of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes reported have risen substantially over the last decade, federal hate crime statistics show. During that period, US state legislatures have passed an unprecedented number of anti-LGBTQ+ measures, with 2021 deemed the “worst year” ever by the  Human Rights Campaign . Many US schools have  banned LGBTQ+ books , and  attacks on queer spaces  are on the rise. In recent months, rightwing activists have stoked fears by promoting conspiracy myths that queer-friendly people are “ grooming ” children for sexual abuse. “Those people tracking down queer men to bash, they have a pocket full of hatred on any number of issues that will lead them to pick up that beer bottle,” King says. “They might have new language to use while they’re bashing us over the head, but they would still be bashing us over the head.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/monkeypox-homophobia-lgbtq-rightwing,The Guardian
"Monkeypox vaccine: what’s available in Australia, and who should get it?",Melissa Davey,2022-08-04 05:42:00,"On 28 July Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance”. This means disease spread is serious enough that national policy, interventions and public messaging is needed to combat it, along with more resources. It follows the World Health Organization declaring  the spread of monkeypox a global health emergency  earlier in July. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there have been 20,311 monkeypox cases in 71 countries, including Australia, that have not seen monkeypox spread before. Here’s what we know about the vaccines and who should get vaccinated in Australia. On 4 August, the  Australian government announced it had bought 450,000 doses of the third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine , the first 22,000 of which were due to arrive within two weeks. That vaccine would be prioritised for at-risk groups including men who have sex with men – especially those travelling to countries with a significant outbreak – sex workers, and immunisation providers who are administering the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine.  The ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine is also registered for use in Australiaand protects against monkeypox, but as it uses a weakened live pox virus it is not suitable for immunocompromised people. Supply of this vaccine is available to states and territories through the national medical stockpile. It hasn’t been widely used, since smallpox has been eradicated. With  more than 70 countries now affected by monkeypox outbreaks , this newer vaccine is in short supply globally.  The older ACAM2000 vaccine is made from a virus called vaccinia, which is a type of pox virus related to smallpox and monkeypox, but which does not cause either disease, and which is also much milder than both viruses. Administering the vaccine requires special training. The skin is repeatedly scratched with a needle dipped into the vaccine. The virus begins to grow at the injection site, causing a red, itchy sore spot, or a “pock” in the days afterwards. It then eventually blisters and scabs over, and may leave a small scar. The vaccine stimulates the immune system to develop antibodies that can then help the body recognise and then fight an infection if exposure to monkeypox occurs. There is a risk that the vaccinia virus can be transmitted from the wound site to their close contacts. Those who are severely immunocompromised, who are pregnant, or who have eczema are most at risk, and can suffer serious adverse events either from being vaccinated or exposed to someone who has been. The risk of transmission from a vaccinated person to other people can be reduced by covering the injection site and good hygiene. The site is only infectious until scabbed over. The newer vaccine, known as Jynneos in Australia, does not carry the same risk and can be used in immunocompromised people and is also safe for pregnant women, children, and those with skin conditions. It is administered more easily, given in two doses four weeks apart, though people already vaccinated against smallpox in the past may only need one dose. It has fewer side effects than ACAM2000, and doesn’t require the same aftercare precautions. On 28 July Kelly announced the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) had made recommendations around how this newer vaccine should be used so that health workers are ready to administer it once supply is available in Australia. Kelly did not say when he expects the vaccine to be widely available, and Atagi advice states only that “limited supplies … have been secured by the Commonwealth and some states and territories,” though it is unclear if it has arrived in Australia yet. Most healthy people recover from monkeypox within a few weeks, experiencing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. In some cases, monkeypox may begin with a rash or sores in the mouth and on the face, which may then spread to other parts of the body. Severe illness and death is a risk in rare cases, particularly in immunocompromised people. ACAM2000 does protect against monkeypox. But according to Atagi, Jynneos is the preferred vaccine for these vulnerable groups, and it is also the preferred vaccine for use in people exposed to the virus and at risk of developing disease. Vaccination after exposure can prevent disease developing, known as post-exposure prophylaxis. Atagi advice states that “For healthy non-pregnant adults, where Jynneos is not suitable or not available, ACAM2000 has an established profile and may be considered” for those exposed to the virus or at high risk of exposure. The good news is monkeypox does not spread easily between people. You need close contact with the lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets through extended face-to-face contact with an infected person to be at risk. With a low number of cases in Australia, contact tracing is straightforward and infection risk is lower, but  high-risk communities especially are on alert . Until at least the end of November, monkeypox is a notifiable disease in Australia, which means health authorities must be told of every case. In Atagi advice updated late July, the key risk groups recommended for vaccination include anyone who is a high risk monkeypox close contact within the past 14 days. High risk groups include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have a high number of sexual contacts are at the highest risk of monkeypox infection. Those living with HIV, a recent history of multiple sexual partners, participating in group sex, or attending sex on premises venues may also be considered for vaccination, the advice states. Those taking HIV prevention medication due to having a number of sexual partners may also be recommended for vaccination. Atagi states that sex workers, particularly those whose clients are in high-risk categories, and anyone in risk category planning travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, should also have vaccination recommended to them between four-to-six weeks prior to departure. Healthcare workers who will be administering ACAM200 can be offered either vaccine if they have not previously received a smallpox vaccine. Healthcare workers who will only be administering the Jynneos vaccine and otherwise have no anticipated occupational exposure to monkeypox are not routinely recommended for smallpox vaccination. For those health workers who have already received a smallpox vaccine in the past, a booster dose is recommended if the previous dose of a smallpox vaccine was given more than ten years prior. Vaccination is also being offered on a case-by-case basis to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, such as household contacts and health workers. “Vaccination within four days of first exposure to an infectious case will provide the highest likelihood of prevention of disease,” Atagi says. A systematic review  published in 2019 suggests that protection offered against smallpox virus  may last more than 20 years after vaccination. A  separate small study  found protection may last 35 years or longer. It is hoped protection against monkeypox would last similarly. According to Atagi: “Childhood smallpox vaccination may confer a longer lasting immune response than vaccination during adulthood, however this is uncertain. Those who have previously received a smallpox vaccine are likely to have some residual protection.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/monkeypox-vaccine-australia-can-you-get-it-and-who-should-eligibility-side-effects-what-available,The Guardian
California declares state of emergency over monkeypox,,2022-08-02 02:08:00,"California has declared a a state of emergency over monkeypox, becoming the second state in three days to do so as US authorities speed up efforts to combat the outbreak. The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said Monday’s declaration would help the state coordinate a government-wide response, seek more vaccines and lead outreach and education efforts on where people can get treatment and vaccines. California, the nation’s most populous state, follows in the footsteps of similar declarations issued by  New York  and  San Francisco . There are currently more than 5,800 cases of monkeypox in the US, according  to the CDC , and public health agencies, left battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, have faced criticism  for being too slow  to act. The World Health Organization recently declared monkeypox a  global health emergency .   The outbreak has far has been disproportionately  affected  gay and bisexual men and reopened old traumas for those who lived through the HIV/Aids crisis. “It doesn’t escape me that we’re once again in a moment where there’s a lack of urgency when a public health crisis is impacting cis and trans men as well as non-binary folks within the same social and sexual networks,” Tyler TerMeer, the CEO of the San Francisco Aids foundation,  recently told  the Guardian. Newsom’s proclamation allows emergency medical personnel to administer monkeypox vaccines that are approved by the federal government. The state said it was also building on the steps developed during the coronavirus pandemic to set up vaccination clinics and make sure there is outreach to vulnerable populations in cooperation with local and community-based organizations. “We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” Newsom said in a statement announcing his declaration. “The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,” said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco, who hailed the governor’s decision.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/california-monkeypox-state-of-emergency-declared,The Guardian
"Australia can avoid big monkeypox outbreak with targeted vaccination, health experts say",Josh Taylor,2022-07-30 02:00:00,"Australia is in a good position to avoid a significant monkeypox outbreak by the time of WorldPride in Sydney in 2023 if state and federal governments harness the capability of sexual health organisations and appropriately target vaccines to gay and bisexual men over the coming months, experts say. As cases climb into the tens of thousands in the northern hemisphere, Australia on Thursday declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance”. There were 44 reported cases in Australia by Thursday, mostly in returned international travellers, people aged 21 to 40 years and men who have sex with men. The  global rise in cases  coincided with pride events in the northern hemisphere, where there are often large parties and travellers from across the globe. But the stigmatisation of the gay community during the Aids crisis in the 80s and 90slingers in public memory. This has led to some reluctance in media outlets globally to discuss monkeypox as something where 98% of cases globally are currently men who have sex with men. “Any health issue, scare, outbreak in which gay, bisexual men or queer people in general are targeted immediately brings up a lot of feelings given the last four decades of HIV responses in this country,” activist and co-founder of The Institute of Many, Nic Holas, said. “So whatever we’re doing, we’ve got to acknowledge that there’s going to be a lot of feelings about this in the mix with the science and the data and the facts.” Heath Paynter, deputy CEO of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, told Guardian Australia that monkeypox is a very different virus from HIV clinically, but it has a lot of similarities to HIV culturally. “That’s because it’s a virus that’s been transmitted through sexual contact and through interconnected sexual networks of gay and bisexual men at the moment in the northern hemisphere,” he said. “But it’s only a matter of time before that starts to happen in Australia with community transmission.” The World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,  said this week  that gay and bisexual men should consider reducing the number of sexual partners they have. But Prof Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV epidemiology and prevention program at the Kirby Institute, said that advice would not be effective unless people knew exactly when they would be able to be vaccinated. “I think you could argue that that’s what most gay men did during the Covid lockdowns, they stopped having casual sex, as [did] young heterosexual people for a few weeks,” he said. “That’s sustainable provided it’s not a long-term thing.” The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) this week updated its  clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox  to include the use of a MVA-BN vaccine named Jynneos, and experts believe a government deal to secure a supply of the vaccines is imminent. Holas said Australia has a chance to get ahead of the outbreak in the next few months, but it will take the right strategy to get on top of it, with a community-led response. “Queer people are the architects of safer sex – we invented safer sex. It wasn’t a clinician or a politician – we came up with those strategies, and we rolled them out at a community level,” he said. “So we hopefully see similar things here when it comes to monkeypox.” Paynter said the conversation about disease prevention should be led by people who can speak the language of the queer community, and targeted advertising on social media and through dating apps such as Grindr. “If the messaging is too broad, then what you might end up with is people being worried about the virus who actually aren’t a target or priority population, and then the resourcing ends up going towards the wrong population,” he said. “We must avoid a situation where people weaponise something like monkeypox, and this happened with HIV in many places around the world. We must have a language that is very respectful because we don’t want people being turned away, or at least not engaging in health services, for fear of being stigmatised, for fear of being judged.” Colin Batrouney, Thorne Harbour Health’s director of health promotion, policy and communications, said public health messaging needs to strike a balance between raising awareness and not causing panic.  “Our focus has been on what monkeypox is, how it is contracted, symptoms, treatment and prevention,” he said. “Our approach to sexual health and wellbeing has always been one of non-judgemental, clear information and positivity.” “The only moral dimension to the disease will be the inability or unwillingness of systems and governments around the world to deal with it.” Atagi has identified gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men as at highest risk, as well as sex workers. Grulich said it would make sense to prioritise gay and bisexual men who have travelled internationally for vaccination, followed by all highly sexually active gay and bisexual men. “Australia is a little bit fortunate that this has happened in the depths of winter when there’s not a lot in the way of great big gay gatherings for gay men,” he said. That will change when Sydney hosts WorldPride in February and March next year, and people will travel from all across the world. “It’s utterly critical that sexually active gay men be vaccinated. We’ve got a few months for that, we mustn’t lose sight of that, Grulich said. “It’s quite conceivable that we could get the great majority of sexually active gay men vaccinated in that time.” Paynter agreed. “I think we could really go close towards herd immunity through vaccination, subject to having enough supply of the vaccine.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/australia-can-avoid-big-monkeypox-outbreak-with-targeted-vaccination-health-experts-say,The Guardian
WHO stresses monkeypox surge not linked to monkeys amid attack reports,,2022-08-09 17:36:00,"The World Health Organization has stressed that  monkeypox  outbreaks are not linked to monkeys, following a number of reported attacks on the primates in Brazil. “What people need to know is that the transmission we are seeing is happening between humans,” a WHO spokesperson, Margaret Harris, told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday. She said the primates could not be blamed for the surge in monkeypox cases in  Brazil  after reports in a number of cities of physical attacks on and poisonings of monkeys. In a natural reserve in Rio Preto, São Paulo state, 10 monkeys appeared to have been poisoned or intentionally injured in less than a week, according to the news site G1. Rescuers and activists suspect the monkeys were poisoned and attacked after three monkeypox cases were confirmed in the area.  Globally, more than 28,100 cases and 12 deaths have been recorded, as  monkeypox infections have risen since May  outside the west and central African countries where the disease has long been endemic. To date, Brazil has registered more than 1,700 cases and one death, according to WHO data. But Harris underlined that despite its name, monkeys are not the main transmitters of the disease and have nothing to do with the outbreak.  Monkeypox  received its name because the virus was first identified in monkeys kept for research in Denmark, but the disease is found in a number of animals, and most frequently in rodents. While the virus could jump from animals to humans, the recent global explosion of cases was due to close-contact transmission between humans, Harris said. “The concern should be about where it [is circulating] in the human population and what humans can do to protect themselves from getting it and transmitting it,” she said. People “should certainly not be attacking any animals”. Harris said the best way to rein in the virus was “if people recognise they have symptoms and go get help and medical care and take precautions to prevent it being transmitted”. That requires raising awareness among those most at risk. Nearly all the cases so far have been among men who have sex with men, and the WHO has cautioned against stigmatisation of those infected. “Any stigmatisation of any person infected is going to increase the transmission, because if people are afraid of identifying themselves as being infected, then they will not get care and will not take precautions,” Harris said. “So do not stigmatise any animal or any human, because if you do do that, we will have a much larger outbreak.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/brazilians-stop-attacks-monkeys-monkeypox-world-health,The Guardian
"Australia secures 450,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine",Paul Karp,2022-08-04 05:34:00,"The Australian government has bought 450,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine, including 22,000 that will arrive this week and next. The third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine will be prioritised for at-risk groups including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, especially those travelling to countries with a significant outbreak. Australia has so far only had 58 cases of monkeypox in the 13 weeks since the virus began spreading in 76 countries outside those where it has been endemic for years. On 28 July  monkeypox was declared  a “communicable disease incident of national significance” in Australia after  a declaration by the World Health Organization . On Thursday the health minister, Mark Butler, told reporters in Canberra that the Morrison government had begun negotiations for the third-generation vaccine on 20 May, just one day after the first case in Australia and one day before the federal election. After 27 meetings, Australia has bought 450,000 doses including 100,000 to arrive this year and the remaining 350,000 in 2023. The vaccine can be used to prevent spread and post-exposure. Monkeypox can also be prevented with a smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, which is registered for use in Australia and contained in the national medical stockpile, but that vaccine uses a weakened live pox virus, making it unsuitable for the immunocompromised. Butler said the third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine was “by far the more effective and user-friendly for patients with compromised immunity”. It could also be administered to pregnant women, children and those with skin conditions. The minister said the government had procured the “world’s best vaccines for Australians and we are one of only a very limited number of countries that have been able to secure supplies of this third-generation vaccine in 2022 in a highly contested market”. “We will be rolling out the vaccine through state and territory largely, central health clinics,” he said, starting with the at-risk cohorts  identified by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation . These are: people categorised as a high-risk monkeypox contact in the past 14 days; gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men with a high number of sexual contacts; sex workers; and immunisation providers who are administering the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I’m very pleased with the work the chief medical officer and the department have been able to do in a short period of time, particularly the secure the supply of vaccines in a highly contested global market,” Butler said He noted that case numbers had “increased quite quickly” around the world, to more than 25,000 including 6,000 in the US, 4,000 in Spain, and 3,000 in the UK but Australia had “managed to avoid the worst elements you have seen in North America and Europe”. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he would not “pick a number” of estimated total cases. “But the important thing is all the work done since May in Australia, and the added benefit of the vaccine, will continue to help us to control the epidemic here in Australia and I’m very confident that will happen.” The Australian Federation of Aids Organisations acting chief executive, Heath Paynter, said “the swift procurement of these vaccines is a very positive step”. “While local transmission of Monkeypox has so far been limited, we can’t rely on that to continue,” he said. “Cities such as London, Montreal, Lisbon and Madrid are all dealing with significant community transmission.” “The availability of the monkeypox vaccine for people who need it is a critical forward defence against transmission. It will help people look after their own health as well as that of people they are intimate with.” Dr Nick Medland, a sexual health specialist and researcher at the Kirby Institute, said: “We expect the outbreak will begin to slow after 75,000 members of our community have had one dose of the vaccine and may not be eliminated until 250,000 doses have been administered to those who need them most.” Monkeypox results in  rashes and flu-like symptoms , which Kelly said in July were “relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments”. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” he said. “The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/australia-secures-450000-doses-of-monkeypox-vaccine,The Guardian
New York City declares monkeypox a public health emergency,,,"Officials in  New York  City declared a public health emergency due to the spread of the monkeypox virus on Saturday, calling the city “the epicenter” of the outbreak. The announcement by the mayor,  Eric Adams , and the health commissioner, Ashwin Vasan, said as many as 150,000 city residents could be at risk of infection. The declaration will allow officials to issue emergency orders under the city health code and implement measures to help slow the spread. “We will continue to work with our federal partners to secure more [vaccine] doses as soon as they become available,” Adams and Vasan said in the statement. “This outbreak must be met with urgency, action and resources, both nationally and globally, and this declaration of a public health emergency reflects the seriousness of the moment.” In the past two days, the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a  state disaster emergency declaration  and the state health department called monkeypox an “imminent threat to public health”. New York had recorded 1,345 cases as of Friday, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California had the second-most, with 799. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared monkeypox a global health emergency  on 23 July and San Francisco’s mayor on Thursday announced a state of emergency over the growing number of cases. The once-rare disease has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades but was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere. To date, there have been more than 22,000 monkeypox cases reported in nearly 80 countries since May, with about 75 suspected deaths in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Congo. On Friday, Brazil and Spain reported deaths linked to monkeypox, the first reported outside Africa. Spain reported a second monkeypox death on Saturday. The virus spreads through prolonged and close skin-to-skin contact as well as sharing bedding, towels and clothing. In Europe and North America, it has spread primarily among men who have sex with men, though health officials emphasise that the virus can infect anyone. The type of monkeypox virus identified in this outbreak is rarely fatal, and people usually recover within weeks, but the lesions and blisters caused by the virus are painful. The virus is more of a concern among vulnerable people such as those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/new-york-city-monkeypox-public-health-emergency,The Guardian
‘Like winning the lottery’: Americans struggle to get monkeypox vaccines,Gloria Oladipo,2022-08-07 11:00:00,"“It was like trying to win the lottery. It was so difficult.” On a hot Saturday afternoon last weekend, at  New York  City’s Bronx high school of science, Alexx Dunn, 42, waited in line for a monkeypox vaccine at a public health immunization site. For his elusive appointment that are usually only be booked online, Dunn needed two cellphones (the second borrowed from his co-worker), four different chances to sign up for the shot after failing to  get an appointment  with each new batch of time slots released, and precious time away from his job as a retail manager in the fashionable Manhattan shopping district of SoHo, work that he quickly returned to as soon as his Saturday appointment was over. In the US, the rapid increase of  monkeypox cases  has now officially been declared a  national public health emergency . Before Thursday’s announcement by the Biden administration, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, and the New York state governor, ​​Kathy Hochul, issued separate  emergency declarations . New York City has the bulk of US cases so far, with San Francisco also  badly affected . New York health officials offer vaccinations via an online sign-up portal under strict eligibility, including for those who may have been exposed to monkeypox. Currently, men and members of the LGBTQ+ community are the groups most affected, though anybody can contract the virus. But amid belated increases in appointment availability for those eligible since the  latest outbreak  of this  relatively rare virus  reached Europe  and the US  in the  second half of May , experts and patients are observing that the vaccination process privileges a select few. Those who have the most resources – time, fast internet access and electronic devices, knowledge on monkeypox and vaccinations, sometimes acquired via well-connected friends – have been best placed to snap up limited appointments, while leaving out marginalized communities. Demographic data on who’s getting vaccinated has been largely unavailable. But current figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that racial minorities make up the majority of US monkeypox cases,  ABC News reported . Data from 28 July showed that of the 4,600 reported US cases of monkeypox, Hispanic people accounted for 31% and Black people 27%, despite only making up 19% and 13% of the general population respectively. Data out of New York City  follows a similar trend. Out of 1,630 monkeypox cases in New York reported as of 4 August, Black and Hispanic people together made up more than half. But many worry that the vaccine process isn’t best serving the communities and neighborhoods worst affected by this, and  fears abound  amid  preventable spread .Last Saturday, some faced more challenges than others. “Super easy to sign up for online. No problem at all. Took me maybe three minutes to do the whole thing,” said Steven Harris, 39, who is white and was able to get the appointment while working from home in Manhattan and then travel to the Bronx, the city borough with the  lowest percentage  of white residents and the  highest rate  of poverty But others, such as Charles Robinson, 28, described a dissimilar experience, with Robinson, a biology PhD student, using two laptops to finally secure an appointment on the glitchy health website. “It’s complete bullshit. I don’t understand why we gotta do all this stuff to do one thing,” said Robinson, a Black man, after receiving his first of two recommended vaccine doses on Saturday after traveling from Harlem. Daslyn Colson, who also got a vaccine on Saturday, added that from what she had heard and seen – mainly the line being populated by white people despite the vast majority of Bronx residents being non-white people the overall process seemed to push out actual Bronx residents who may be disproportionately affected by monkeypox. “I know there were some issues the previous times when they had the first wave of vaccines available and people were coming into the Bronx and taking them from Black and brown folks. Seeing that a lot today.” Colson, a Black woman in her late 20s, travelled from East New York to get the vaccine, finding no available appointments online closer to her home. Colson’s observations echoed  complaints  and fears on social media and by others in line, that mostly privileged white people would be able to take advantage of the few available monkeypox vaccine resources. Jason Cianciotto, vice-president of communications and public policy at GMHC, the city non-profit born out of the HIV/Aids crisis in the early 1980s whose website says “Monkeypox: be aware but don’t panic”, spoke of the vaccine shortage. “It [impacts] the low-income communities of color, immigrants, transgender and gender non-conforming people who, for many reasons, have historically lacked access to healthcare, technology, [and may have] jobs that might prevent them from being able to hop online to try to get an appointment,” Cianciotto said. Cianciotto and Anthony Fortenberry, chief nursing officer at the city’s Callen-Lorde community health center, both spoke to the Guardian of a startlingly low level of available vaccine doses that is exacerbating existing health inequalities. New York City only has 79,000 monkeypox  vaccines available , with the US distributing less than one-third of the estimated 3.5m it will need, the New York Times  reported . “[With] the vaccine, when you ration healthcare, only the most privileged are able to access it,” said Fortenberry. For those who do not see a regular physician, getting information on monkeypox is difficult. LGBTQ+ adults, particularly transgender people, are more likely than the general population not regularly to see a doctor or have health insurance, according to a  June 2022 report  from New York state’s department of health. Even for those with healthcare coverage, information is patchy. “I had to do the research. I don’t see the information readily available. It was just by word of mouth,” said Colson, adding that the overall process has been “messy”. Similarly to Dunn, 23-year-old Zachary Skurka, who called the vaccination rollout a “hot mess”, had to call out of work to make his monkeypox vaccine appointment, adding that many of his friends have been unable to make or keep available appointments due to work conflicts. “It’s very hard,” said Skurka. “I’ve had a lot of friends who haven’t been able to book appointments because they’ve either been at work or didn’t make it to the appointment window on time to book one because they were too busy or the site wasn’t working. Many [different] reasons, so they’re still waiting,” he added as he waited outside the Bronx school. “Everybody doesn’t have the ability to wait by the phone and be able to play with the phone to be able to get the appointment,” added Jonathan Adams, 38, who commuted across the city to get the vaccine after snagging an appointment on his fourth try. Cianciotto said that many GHMC clients, particularly those with poor internet access or disabilities, have struggled in the current process.  While appointments can now be made via telephone for those struggling online, Cianciotto said that those additional options are poorly advertised. Inequality in vaccine supply is at risk of becoming  a global problem . New York City is slowly opening up more vaccine locations. But Sandile Mhlaba, 24, had to commute over an hour to the Bronx by  public transportation  from the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn to get the shot. “I’m an immunocompromised person so if I have to be on the subway [train] for a long period of time, around a bunch of people who aren’t wearing masks, that’s obviously really challenging, but I wanted to prioritize my health so I said it’s worth it for this,” Mhlaba said. Meanwhile, for Bronx residents like Julio Arniella, 56, the flood of people commuting for the vaccine, including from wealthier neighborhoods such as Manhattan’s Chelsea, has pushed him and other residents out of securing their shot. Arniella was only able to secure his vaccination when he used a different zip code, having been unsuccessful using his Bronx postal code, he said. “For a person like myself, living in the Bronx, I can’t even put my own zip code in to get an appointment,” said Arniella. “I was not able to get one in my own borough.” Representatives from the New York City department of health said data breaking down vaccinations by demographics was being worked on. The department sent along  23 July coverage  about outreach efforts in a gay bar in the Queens borough, more than two months  after the first US cases  in this outbreak, amid US public health  services being severely depleted  by the  catastrophic coronavirus pandemic . Back in the Bronx, Dunn talked about the pressure to get the monkeypox vaccine amid the crush of unmet demand. “Imagine thousands of people trying to get the vaccine at one time … I feel like I was trying to save my life, it was crazy,” said Dunn before rushing back to work.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/monkeypox-vaccine-appointments-new-york-san-francisco,The Guardian
"Slow response to monkeypox exposes ‘tired, overworked’ US health agencies",Jessica Glenza,2022-08-01 07:00:00,"A “slow and bureaucratic” response that has seen monkeypox spread rapidly across the US – with more than a thousand cases in New York City alone – reveals just how badly battered local health agencies have been since the Covid pandemic, advocates have said. Once a rare African virus, monkeypox has taken hold amid the ragged patchwork of city, county, state and federal agencies that make up the US public health infrastructure. “Unfortunately, delayed actions mean monkeypox has spread within the gay community and among other men who have sex with men,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “This outbreak has grown to be a public health crisis in America. We are still in a very chaotic situation at the state and local level with an organized response.” As an explanation for the chaos, many observers point to how Covid reshaped the landscape for public health officials. Once considered neutral arbiters of information, many health officials were  politically attacked  following  unpopular mask and vaccination policies . Across the country, public health officials were  harassed, threatened, fired or simply felt burned out and quit . The situation was not helped as resources that had once been devoted to things like tracking communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, or running routine vaccination clinics, were suddenly diverted to Covid-19. Sexual health clinics have struggled, too, as testing and staff resources were devoted to Covid-19, hurting organizations that had already suffered years of underfunding. The result has been worse health outcomes for many basic public health services:  routine vaccinations for children  have fallen;  overdose deaths have exploded ; and the US has posted a  record-high rate of sexually transmitted infections  for the sixth year running. As monkeypox has spread, the Biden administration has attempted to respond by releasing about 1.1m vaccines and ramping up testing capacity, which has grown from about 6,000 to 80,000 per week. The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a  global health emergency  this week, and the US could follow suit by declaring monkeypox a national public health emergency, which would release more resources to local agencies. “The system is tired, it’s overworked, it’s underpaid, it’s understaffed,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “All the same issues that plagued us during the pandemic are still with us and haven’t gone away. “What’s added to it, with monkeypox and beyond, is that we also have a workforce that has documented mental health trauma after the pandemic.” Public health advocates want the president and Congress to allocate more funds to respond to the outbreak, and for sexual health clinics in general. Public facilities have proven to be the first line of defense with monkeypox, even as federal prevention funding for such work has  fallen 41% since 2003 . “Local sexual health providers are being asked to respond to monkeypox on top of an already out-of-control STI epidemic in America,” said Harvey. “We are at the breaking point: we need the Biden administration and Congress to immediately fund STI public health programs and clinical services.” Although anyone can catch monkeypox, the virus has primarily affected men who have sex with men. Sexual health clinics have often been frontline responders to the outbreak because of how monkeypox can present its symptoms, with lesions around the genitals and the anus – though sex is just one way monkeypox can spread. Any close contact with an infected person can spread the disease, including touching, kissing and cuddling, as well as sharing glasses, utensils, bedding and towels. Although the virus, which belongs to the same family as smallpox, is rarely fatal, symptoms can be  excruciating , with painful lesions and flu-like symptoms, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Up to  10% of people  are reportedly requiring hospitalization, , and many are showing up in emergency departments because of severe pain, said Freeman. The situation is exacerbated because testing for monkeypox is limited. There is no home test and results can take days. There is, however, a vaccine, for which people at heightened risk may be eligible; they may also qualify for treatment with the drug tecovirimat, sold as TPOXX. But the barriers are significant, obtaining it can be tricky, and tecovirimat – usually reserved for people with severe symptoms – must be requested by doctors from the government’s national strategic national stockpile, which involves significant paperwork. Moreover, people without insurance probably lack access to both vaccine and drug, said Freeman; about 12.7% of the LGBTQ+ community lacks health insurance compared with 11.4% of the general population, according to  an analysis  by federal officials. Even if you do have insurance, there are hurdles baked into the US healthcare system, such as trying to navigate between urgent care clinics, primary care providers and state health departments. Freeman recounted a story she about a local health department that asked its state for information about a monkeypox outbreak. The state replied to check with the CDC; the CDC then redirected local officials back to the state. “There’s a lot of finger-pointing going on here,” she said. “We should have learned. We should know more now than we knew three years ago from our Covid response [about] what we need to do here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/monkeypox-us-virus-vaccine-health-response,The Guardian
‘I’m one of the lucky ones’: vaccines scarce as US monkeypox cases rise,Gloria Oladipo,2022-07-30 07:00:00,"monkeypox vaccination But Madero admits that he was “one of the lucky ones”, successfully securing a vaccine after a month of waiting. “Better to be safe than sorry,” Madero said. “Problem is, it’s hard to get it, and you have to go online, and then they only have so many.” In New York, monkeypox is  officially an imminent public health threat . More than a quarter of all monkeypox cases in the US – 1,341 – are from New York state, with the  majority coming from New York City . Furthermore, the US leads the world in confirmed cases – nearly 5,000 as of Friday, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many have been clamoring to get a scarce number of available vaccination appointments. But getting vaccinated has proven to be a confusing process even for those who are eligible – namely, men who have sex with men and have multiple partners. Daniel Enderle, 31, came to the clinic after hearing from a friend about available vaccine appointments. Enderle hoped to get a shot by walking in for an appointment, but was turned away and referred by staff to the city health department’s online appointment portal. Currently, anyone interested in getting the vaccine must go through the city’s health department  website  and make an appointment. While all appointments have been filled through July, those eligible and interested are encouraged to check the portal for availabilities that open up because of cancellations,  the New York Times  reported. Close contacts of those who have monkeypox will be contacted separately and receive instructions on how to make a vaccine appointment. Enderle admitted he had not gotten a chance to research the process, but he said he hopes that public health employees find other ways to make the vaccination process more accessible, including creating walk-in appointments. “Get behind it before it affects too many people,” Enderle said. Michael Crawford, 57, said that while getting a vaccination appointment for monkeypox has not been as difficult for him, he has heard about the unreliable appointment process others are experiencing. “My experience seems to be very simple,” said Crawford, who had help making his appointment. “Everything I’ve seen in the media seems to be disastrous so I’m confused as to why there are two such starkly different experiences.” Complications around the vaccine rollout have also mirrored the stifled deployment of information on monkeypox as an illness. To many, monkeypox has  largely been characterized  as a sexually transmitted illness that primarily affects LGBTQ+ communities, even though the illness can spread by people in close or intimate contact with someone else. Enderle said that the characterization of monkeypox has brought on additional stigma. “It’s subtle, kind of like, ‘Be careful when you hang out with the gays,’” he said. Daniel Couri, who managed to get the vaccine, said the language used around monkeypox is similar to descriptors used during the HIV/Aids epidemic in the 1980s. “I don’t want it to be labeled as a gay disease,” he said. Many believe that more needs to be done by public health officials to increase awareness of the illness and availability of vaccines, despite continued attention on the coronavirus pandemic. “Get it together,” Crawford said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/us-monkeypox-vaccine-cases-rise,The Guardian
Monkeypox virus: what are the symptoms and should Australia be worried?,Melissa Davey,2022-08-03 07:46:00,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has  declared monkeypox   a global public health emergency . Such a designation – the highest level of global alert – currently also applies to Covid-19 and polio. In Australia, more than 40 cases of monkeypox have been identified. The country’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, in late July declared it a “communicable disease incident of national significance” which means coordinated resources – including medicines, and public health campaigns – are needed to tackle it.  Europe remains the epicentre of the outbreak. So should Australians be worried? The monkeypox virus leads to flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, body aches and chills. It also causes a rash that may look like pimples, blisters, lesions or sores. The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak, it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people, Prof Kelly, said. People might only develop a couple of sores. Most cases of monkeypox in Australia have been among people aged 21 to 40 years. “The experience internationally and in Australia to date is most cases have been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men,” Kelly said. Condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission. Intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” the chief medical officer said. It’s important to note that the risk of monkeypox is not limited to men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious is at risk. Kelly said: “It is far less harmful than Covid-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic.”  Monkeypox  is also “far less transmissible” than Covid, he said. Yes. Information about the vaccines available in Australia, and who is recommended to receive them,  can be found here . Currently, only close contacts of cases and those at high risk of infection, as well as some health workers, are recommended for vaccination. According to Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease at the Australian National University, while monkeypox is “not highly transmissible from person to person” there needs to be a public awareness campaign, especially targeting at-risk groups such as men who have sex with men, as most cases have been identified in this group. “It’s obviously spreading,” he said. “If you look at the numbers, it’s not exploding like a respiratory virus, so this is very different to Covid and contact tracing is easier. But we will see more numbers and that’s why we need to diagnose the cases quickly.” The first case of monkeypox anywhere was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa, during intense efforts to find and eliminate smallpox. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When the virus appears outside Africa, it is because someone travelled to an endemic region, became infected and returned home. But it is increasingly being found in cases who had not travelled overseas before being diagnosed, which means local transmission is occurring. There are  two strains  of monkeypox: a Central African strain with a fatality rate of 10.6%, and a West African strain with a much lower mortality rate of between 1% and 3.6%. The latter is the strain that is spreading including in the UK and Australia. But there have been warnings in the past that countries outside Africa have become too complacent about the virus due to its rarity. A  study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases  in February found monkeypox cases, though rare, are rising. The study authors reviewed monkeypox data from many countries and studies, and found “an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults”. “These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission,” the study found. “The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease.” The authors urged increased worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases to understand its changing epidemiology, and described it as a “resurging disease”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/monkeypox-australia-symptoms-outbreak-virus-disease-cases-what-is-it-transmission,The Guardian
Biden administration declares monkeypox a public health emergency,,2022-08-04 22:17:00,"The  Biden administration  has declared the US monkeypox outbreak a national public health emergency which will trigger extra resources and other measures aimed at combatting the virus. During a news briefing with reporters Xavier Becerra, the health secretary, said: “We’re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously.” Becerra plans to empower US officials to expedite countermeasures including vaccines and treatments, allowing for greater flexibility in the administering the supply of vaccines. Access to vaccines has been  a consistent problem  as the number of US monkeypox cases has risen. States and cities including New York and San Francisco have issued  declarations of emergency . “We will leave no stone unturned in our effort to combat this virus … This virus is moving fast,” said Robert Fenton, recently named by Joe Biden as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. The White House said it has made more than 1.1m doses available and has helped to boost domestic diagnostic capacity to 80,000 tests a week. The monkeypox virus spreads through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, including hugging, cuddling and kissing, as well as sharing bedding, towels and clothing. The people who have gotten sick so far have been primarily men who have sex with men. But health officials emphasize that the virus can infect anyone. The urgency in the current response stems from the rapid spread of the virus coupled with the limited availability of the two-dose vaccine called Jynneos, which is considered the main medical weapon against the disease. The doses, given 28 days apart, are currently being given to people soon after they think they were exposed, as a measure to prevent symptoms. During the call with reporters announcing the emergency in the US, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Robert Califf, said regulators are reviewing an approach that would stretch supplies by allowing health professionals to vaccinate up to five people instead of one with each vial of Jynneos. Under this so-called “dose-sparing” approach, physicians and others would use a shallower injection under the skin, instead of the subcutaneous injection currently recommended in the vaccine’s labeling. Califf said a decision authorizing that approach could come “within days”. That would require another declaration, to allow the government to alter its guidelines on how to administer the vaccine, officials said. Health officials pointed to a study published in 2015 that found that Jynneos vaccine administered that way was as effective at stimulating the immune system as when the needle plunger deeper into other tissue. But experts also have acknowledged they are still gathering information on how well the conventional administration of one or two full doses works against the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared monkeypox a global health emergency  on 23 July. Later that month the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”. Tedros said 98% of monkeypox cases detected since May had been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. He called for those at risk to take steps to protect themselves. “That means making safe choices for yourself and others, for men who have sex with men,” Tedros said. “This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/monkeypox-biden-administration-public-health-emergency,The Guardian
Spain reports second death related to monkeypox,,2022-07-30 13:55:00,"Spain reported its second monkeypox-related death on Saturday, in what is thought to be Europe’s second death from the disease in the current outbreak. Spain reported its first death  on Friday , shortly after Brazil reported the first monkeypox-related death outside Africa in the current wave of the disease. According to a World Health Organization report from 22 July, only five deaths had been reported, all in Africa. The WHO last Saturday declared the rapidly spreading outbreak  a global health emergency , its highest level of alert. In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish health ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country. Of the 3,750 patients for whom it had information, 120 or 3.2% had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said, without providing further details. The first death occurred in the north-eastern Valencia region and the cause was encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain associated with the infection, local media reported, quoting the regional health department. The Brazilian victim was a 41-year-old man who, according to the health ministry, also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. “The comorbidities aggravated his condition,” the ministry said. It added that the patient was hospitalised in the south-eastern city of Belo Horizonte and died from septic shock after being taken to intensive care.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/spain-reports-second-death-related-to-monkeypox,The Guardian
Monday briefing: Gay and bisexual men are most at risk from monkeypox. Why aren’t we saying so clearly?,Archie Bland,2022-07-25 06:28:00,"Good morning. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization  declared monkeypox to be a global health emergency , and said the outbreak “is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners”. In the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust  called for an urgent injection of cash to scale up vaccinations , which are being targeted at men in high-risk groups. And outside  Guy’s Hospital in London  yesterday, a three-hour queue snaked around the building to get a jab – with those waiting for their turn almost all gay and bisexual men. This makes sense: all the evidence suggests that the outbreak is highly concentrated among men who have sex with men, and the virus is overwhelmingly transmitted through sexual contact. But even as that has become abundantly clear, there has still been a curious reticence in much of the public health messaging about saying so. Today’s newsletter, with sexual health activist and researcher Dr Will Nutland and Guardian columnist Owen Jones, is about why that is, what the consequences are, and what a better way to talk about the problem might be. That’s right after the headlines. is facing “the greatest workforce crisis” in its history France endured another day of disruption unveil plans to curb China’s soft power sought to reassure Egypt over Russian grain supplies has executed four democracy activists Monkeypox is serious: symptoms include fever, an intense headache, a rash and lesions  that can be extremely painful . It can lead to hospitalisation and dangerous complications. But most cases are mild. While it can be fatal, there have been no recorded deaths linked to the current outbreak in the UK, and, the WHO said on Saturday, only five deaths among more than 16,000 reported cases worldwide. While most people are very unlikely to catch monkeypox at the moment, for the communities where it is spreading, it’s suddenly a huge subject. There are fears that if it is not stopped, it could become  an entrenched STD  (although it is not usually transmitted through bodily fluids, but through prolonged skin-to-skin contact). “I knew almost nothing about monkeypox about three months ago,” said Dr Will Nutland, co-founder of two organisations devoted to gay and bisexual men’s health,  PrEPster  and the  Love Tank . “Now it’s like another job on top of my job. I’m a bit monkeypoxed out.” Despite that concentration, as Guardian columnist Owen Jones has warned, efforts to talk about it clearly have sometimes been characterised as evidence of bigotry. “The madness” of that position,  he tweeted yesterday , “is that the logic of [the] argument is the vaccine shouldn’t be prioritised for men who have sex with men.” Here’s what we know about how monkeypox is spreading, and how it should be addressed: Almost all cases of monkeypox are among gay and bisexual men The evidence is clear:  an article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week , which looked at infections across 16 countries between April and June, found that 98% of cases were in gay or bisexual men. In 95% of cases, the infection occurred through sexual activity. The R number, of coronavirus fame,  is 1.6 for men who have sex with men in the UK , but below 1 for everyone else. In the UK,  more than 70% of cases were in London  as of 6 July. In short, said Nutland: “The vast, vast majority of cases are in gay and bisexual men, and pretending that that’s not the case doesn’t help any of us.” The public health messaging hasn’t always matched that reality A mantra of public health communication on the subject in the UK and US is that anyone can can catch monkeypox. “Well yeah, anyone   get monkeypox, but not anyone is getting monkeypox,” said Nutland. Lurking in the background of that approach is “the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which led to huge stigmatisation”, said Owen. In other words, part of what’s underpinning this may be a well-intentioned desire to avoid creating a sense of shame. “But if we’re not clear about where the risk is, it’s completely self-defeating, because that’s who we have to prioritise talking to and protecting.” That focus has started to change – and Nutland acknowledged that “it’s always hard in the early stages [of an outbreak] to understand where transmission is happening and what might happen next”. But the data has been clear for a while now. Nutland was keen to praise “some exceptional people” at the UK  Health  Security Agency, but he also said: “I really wish more attention had been paid to gay and bisexual men.” He points to a poster campaign, “Spot it, stop it”, saying: “The vast majority of that campaign has not targeted who it should have.” This PDF  shows a bafflingly generic example. A middle-aged straight couple in West Wittering might see it and conclude they’d better have separate beds for a while. A better approach, Nutland said, is the one being adopted by PrEPster and the Love Tank, which have distributed 5,000 information packs through saunas, sex shops and other venues whose clients are most likely to be at risk. Abstinence-based messaging (still) doesn’t work “I work alongside some people who want us just to call for gay and bisexual men to stop having sex for a month to get on top of this,” says Nutland. “But we know from Covid, from teenage pregnancy, from so much research on HIV, that when you tell people just not to do something, and particularly not to have sex, it doesn’t work.” And, after all, somebody likely to be receptive to an abstinence message is   likely to abstain once they’ve been told about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it’s transmitted. “For the others, it stops them seeking help if they’re unwell, and they’re more likely to end up hospitalised.” Owen also sees a kind of self-censorship at play among some gay and bisexual commentators (a frustration that led him to  start tweeting about it  about it last week). “People worry about washing the dirty linen in public – it’s almost like, ‘Don’t say it in front of the straights!’ So the discussions are huge for some people on WhatsApp and Instagram, but who is actually getting the right information becomes random. Younger gay and bisexual men, for example, might not have those networks.” Until vaccines are more easily available, there’s only so much communications can do It took Owen 20 phone calls to finally get an appointment for a vaccine. “You go right around the block,” he said. “Sexual health clinics are being overwhelmed, which also means their other services are massively under stress. I rang one place 10 times. They were inundated.” Meanwhile, “supervax” events like the one at Guy’s over the weekend are vital – but,  Nutland points out , other strategies are needed to reach those who may not be comfortable being visible in the queue, who are more likely to be from minority groups. The UK has ordered 100,000 additional doses of vaccine, and the NHS is stepping up vaccination in London (and now advising eligible people to wait to be contacted). It is a good start, says Nutland, but not enough. “Our best estimate if we’re going to double dose is we need at least another 150,000 doses” – and with only one manufacturer globally, that may take some time. Even so, he says: “It isn’t vaccine supply that is the key broken link – it’s our public health system, and our sexual health system in particular. Local authority budgets have been slashed over the last 12 years. And when councils have to make a decision between sexual health services or some other public health service, sexual health is still the poor relation.” dispatch from the eastern Donbas region Leah McLaren looks back  John Harris sees disruptive protest as the only way forward Amelia Tait explores met (over Zoom) for the first time | Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark  celebrated his first Tour de France title  after Belgium’s Jasper Philipsen brought the curtain down on the 109th edition with a sprint victory in Paris. | Max Verstappen  won the French Grand Prix , extending his lead over Charles Leclerc to 63 points after his title rival crashed out.

Global monkeypox vaccine race sparks fears that poorer nations will lose out,Sarah Boseley,2022-08-01 11:24:00,"A scramble for  monkeypox vaccines  is under way, with 35 countries vying for access to the 16.4m doses that exist so far, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and a risk that low-income countries may lose out. Meg Doherty, WHO’s director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said there was “quite a possible risk” that the countries bidding for supplies would be high-income countries. “We’ll have to watch out for this,” she said. “Our mantra has been and continues to be that we want equity. If WHO needs to say that louder and stronger for those countries who are not getting access, we will continue to do that. “We can’t have a  monkeypox response  that’s only responding to the UK, Canada, the United States. We need a response that also addresses what’s happening in the DRC right now; in Nigeria where  cases are going up .” Doherty was speaking at the  International Aids conference in Montreal , Canada, where Prof Chris Beyrer from Johns Hopkins University said on Friday that monkeypox was another preventable pandemic, and the warning signs were there five years ago. “It turns out that monkeypox emerged out of its central African endemic zone into west Africa in 2017, five years ago, and that outbreak has been ongoing for five years with no urgency, no response, no WHO engagement around vaccines in those countries,” said Beyrer, a member of an ongoing Lancet Commission on health and human rights. He added: “Now that it has gone from six endemic countries to 76, and is the new emerging global health threat in the wealthy world, we have this  sense of urgency .” Doherty said discussions were imminent with Japan, where another vaccine had been developed, and that 100m doses of smallpox vaccines also existed, but “that’s probably the least likely vaccine that most countries want to be using at this point in time, due to potential side-effects”. Vaccinating all those who need it will take a long time. In Montreal, only a third of the population most at risk, men who have sex with men, have been vaccinated – 20,000 doses out of 60,000 people estimated to be eligible in the city, said Marina Klein, research director of chronic viral illnesses at McGill University. Latest  WHO figures  show nearly 20,000 cases of monkeypox in 78 countries, and five deaths. The data shows  98% of those affected are men who have sex with men , but there have been small numbers of cases in women and a couple in children.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/01/global-monkeypox-vaccine-race-sparks-fears-that-poorer-nations-will-lose-out,The Guardian
"UK needs urgent vaccine drive to curb monkeypox, campaigners say",Robert Booth,2022-07-24 17:16:00,"Health authorities are underestimating the scale of the response required to stop monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK, sexual health campaigners have warned, as a new vaccination drive is launched. The Terrence Higgins Trust urged the  NHS  and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to urgently pump cash into the system to pay more healthcare workers to administer vaccines. It also wants the number of doses ordered to be doubled to protect against a virus that has infected at least 2,208 people in the UK, according to the latest official figures. Monkeypox is usually mild and is spread by close contact with an infected person or animal, but the risk of severe disease is higher in children, pregnant women and people who are immunosuppressed. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV has estimated that at least 125,000 people will need vaccines, including gay men living with HIV, sex workers, and staff in sexual health clinics and saunas. A double dose of the smallpox vaccine is needed. Last week the NHS announced that it had procured at least 100,000 more doses. It is asking people to wait until asked to come forward for a vaccine, and is prioritising gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men who exhibit high-risk behaviour. Campaigners want more walk-in clinics amid “impatience” among people at risk. “There needs to be a [monkeypox] tsar charged with stopping this becoming endemic,” said Richard Angell, the campaigns director at the Terrence Higgins Trust. “We can’t accept that it gets into the system like chlamydia.” In a letter to the health secretary, Steve Barclay, on Saturday, Labour’s shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “I am concerned you are not acting with the urgency required, and that the response so far has lacked coordination from DHSC and NHS England,” he said. Labour said the vaccination programme was already diverting resources away from sexual health services’ delivery of core services including anti-HIV therapies and long-term contraceptions. “Your department has committed to achieve an 80% reduction in new HIV infections in England by 2025,” Streeting said. “It would be a scandal if progress towards achieving this were to be put in jeopardy.” A government spokesperson said the UKHSA was monitoring vaccine demand and would be able to quickly procure more doses as required. “The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine and are urging people to take up the offer as soon as they’re contacted,” they said. “We have provided more than £3.4bn to local authorities through the public health grant, enabling them to invest in essential frontline services including sexual health services.” On Saturday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization,  declared  the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. The body’s international health regulations emergency committee did not reach a consensus on whether the outbreak warranted the declaration, but Ghebreyesus said it was justified because the virus had “spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little”. He said the risk of monkeypox was “moderate” globally and “high” in Europe and that there was “a clear risk of further international spread”. The UKHSA  said last week  that transmission continues to occur primarily within interconnected sexual networks. “The most recent data suggests that the growth of the outbreak may have slowed,” it said. “This means that we continue to identify new infections, but at a more stable rate.” In a  statement on Friday , Steve Russell, the NHS director of vaccinations, said: “The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London … Thousands more people will be invited very shortly, with the number of clinics expanded too … We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/uk-needs-urgent-vaccine-drive-to-curb-monkeypox-campaigners-say,The Guardian
New Zealand unable to say when monkeypox vaccines will arrive,,,"New Zealand health officials have revealed they are stuck in the queue to order monkeypox vaccine and are unsure when it will arrive. Monkeypox cases continue to rise globally – more than 23,000 people in at least 75 countries have caught the virus. New Zealand confirmed a third case this week. The director of the National Public Health Service, Dr Nick Chamberlain, said New Zealand agencies “have been working to procure vaccines and antiviral treatments since we had our first case of monkeypox”, which was on 9 July. By that point, cases of monkeypox had already appeared in more than 30 non-endemic countries. “The vaccine is only manufactured by one company in the world and there’s a global shortage … and there is considerable international demand,” Chamberlain said. “We are part of a large number of countries who are endeavouring to access vaccine. Many have been unsuccessful.” Unlike New Zealand, Australia has received vaccine doses already, and on Thursday announced it had secured 450,000 doses of third-generation vaccine, which can also act as a treatment. On Thursday afternoon, associate health minister Ayesha Verrall said vaccines would be just one part of a “multi-factorial public health response”. “We’re working to develop a public health response that includes all elements of keeping people safe,” she said, saying New Zealand was “pushing very hard” to get a vaccine. This week, the Burnet Foundation Aotearoa and Sexual Health Society sounded the alarm on New Zealand’s lax response to the global outbreak, calling for a suite of measures.  The most at-risk community is men who have sex with men. Verrall said she “had been very clear with officials my expectation is that they work with members of the affected community to make sure that we do have effective and human rights compliant health promotional approach”. Meanwhile, thousands continue to catch Covid-19 every day. Health authorities, however, are still to sign off on expanding eligibility for a second booster shot, which remains unavailable to those under 50. Opposition Covid spokesperson Chris Bishop said that was the “wrong decision”. “Australia has gone to 30-plus. I don’t understand why we wouldn’t do that here,” he said. Previous director of health Ashley Bloomfield had said a decision on vaccine eligibility was due this week, but on Thursday the deputy director general of health, Andrew Old, said it was still being considered. “The evidence for repeat boosters for over-50s is pretty good, in younger age groups it’s less clear,” he said. Old said the current wave looked to have peaked, but hospitalisations and deaths may continue to rise. On Thursday, 49 New Zealanders were added to the death toll, with 140 deaths over the last week having Covid-19 as a contributing factor.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/new-zealand-unable-to-say-when-monkeypox-vaccines-will-arrive,The Guardian
‘Is sex worth the risk?’ Monkeypox just the latest virus to threaten gay intimacy,Steven W Thrasher,2022-08-03 06:00:00,"Last week, I went to my doctor’s office for a long-scheduled sexually transmitted infection checkup, and started to cry a few minutes into my appointment. Like many gay men, I am on a daily drug called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which prevents me from becoming infected by HIV, even if I were to have sex without a condom or use injection drugs. At 44 years old, I am of the generation who knew about Aids before we even knew about sex; from childhood, I conflated sexuality and fear. PrEP was a gamechanger in taking that fear away. But last week, HIV was not much on my mind, and almost as soon as the physician’s assistant closed the door, I burst into tears. My doctor’s office is staffed almost entirely by gay people seeing gay patients, and the PA, like everyone there, was very kind. I told him that I hadn’t had much sex lately because I was concerned about monkeypox. Even though I had no fever, and even though I often get heat rash in the summer, I was terrified that some skin bumps could be monkeypox. Because he was so nice, I blabbered on that I would   tell anyone   to feel bad if they contracted   infection. But my book was coming out the following week, and it was   viruses, and The PA very sweetly talked me through my feelings and told me that while he didn’t think I had monkeypox, we could do a test if I wanted. He also kindly, but very firmly, told me not to feel bad about feeling bad. “We are all on the edge,” he said – him, me, every gay man we both knew. “It’s been a lot, for all of us.” I realized in that moment how lucky I am to have a gay doctor’s office to take my body and my feelings seriously. And I realized how angry I was that, for the third time in my life, a viral pandemic was dictating my sex life, shaping my professional life, messing with my head, and keeping me from experiencing intimacy. I am, of course, not alone in this. HIV, Sars-CoV-2 and now hMPXV – the virus responsible for monkeypox in humans – have all upended people’s lives, but their effects have not been felt equally. In all three cases, LGBTQ+ people were  disproportionately affected . This is the result of a few related factors, all of them closely linked to societal stigma. One is that LGBTQ+ people are, on average,  more likely to be poor  than straight people and thus more likely to be subjected to the confluence of conditions (incarceration, unemployment, a lack of insurance) that produce a viral underclass. Second, queer people  do not get  a good sexual health education, nor access to queer-specific health resources. And third, gay men have, on average,  more  sexual partners than straight people. Even when coupled, gay men are more likely to be  openly non-monogamous . This is nothing to be ashamed of; being trans or gay is  and queer sex is good. But many people – even many queer people – have internalized the idea that contracting (or even talking about) STIs is bad, shameful and should be hidden. I’ve studied viruses as a journalist, social scientist, and professor of sexual health for more than a decade. Many viruses, including HIV, HPV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, are  categorized as STIs by the CDC  despite being transmitted in a variety of ways. In some places, a large percentage or outright majority of HIV cases now transmit via injection drug use. But a major way these pathogens still transmit is  , and it’s important to name that so that people having sex can know how to protect themselves and their partners. For the same reasons, the emerging monkeypox epidemic should be talked about as an STI, particularly in light of new  research  from the current London outbreak and  scandalously overlooked  research into the  2017 outbreak  in Nigeria that suggests monkeypox may have mutated to allow for transmission through genital secretion. This does not mean that hMPXV can only be transmitted sexually, but it acknowledges that gay sex is a major way such pathogens move. Shame should not be a factor in these discussions. “Viruses are not conscious,”  said  Pedro Serrano, a public health researcher. “They simply follow the mechanistic drive to replicate.” Viruses may not be conscious, but those who choose to punish us for contracting them certainly are. In America, an established (and currently ascendant) political movement exists to punish certain classes of people – trans people, women, gay people, those trying to prevent pregnancy – for having sex. While monkeypox is threatening to repeat the patterns of the past, it is worth remembering that for gay men, this is not our first rodeo. We have loved one another and formed connections even as police officers, bosses, educators, viruses and families of origin have tried to keep us apart. It is wearying having to ask ourselves, once again: are intimacy and sex worth the risk? Still, now is the time to remember or learn anew that queer men of all ages have been doing this for decades. After the Stonewall Riots of 1969, there was a brief window of time when queer men could have a lot of sex with relatively little worry. But then, in the early 1980s, reports trickled in that young gay men were becoming marked by purple lesions and falling ill to an extremely rare form of cancer that usually only affected older men near the Mediterranean Sea. The era of Aids was upon us. To Ash Kotak, monkeypox lesions were reminiscent of those purple Kaposi sarcoma lesions that he saw on loved ones when the Aids pandemic began. A London-based playwright who leads the campaign for the Aids Memorial in London, Kotak lost a “boyfriend, ex-boyfriend and many friends” to Aids and has been living with HIV himself since 1993. “My friends and so many died due to a lack of an early response in the USA and the UK,” he told me. “The issue now is like then: the response is woefully inadequate with the same shaming of gay men, and blaming, too.” Gay men responded to HIV by beginning to use an old technology that had previously been limited to straight people seeking to prevent pregnancy: condoms. Through peer-to-peer education, gay people taught each other how to have sex and intimacy in a safer way, saving countless lives. They also saved millions of lives when, through activism by the group Act Up, they upended the process for drug trials, paving the way for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for Aids and creating the medical architecture that was used to rapidly develop Covid-19 vaccines decades later. The development of those ARVs meant that by 1996, “you didn’t need to die of Aids”, says Thomas Strong, a friend of mine and a Dublin-based American anthropologist and HIV activist who has been living with HIV since 2006 without any health problems. “Then the question becomes, ‘How important is sex? Is it worth   risk?” Strong says, noting that the decline of nearly all Covid mitigation protocols suggests that, for our governments, “the economy is worth the risk”. “Is sexual intimacy worth the risk?” he asks. “It’s in this context of values that vice is structured.” ARVs have been so effective that when properly medicated, people living with HIV cannot pass HIV onward to sex partners. And the medication has been tweaked so that HIV-negative people can proactively avoid the virus, too. In 2012, PrEP was approved by the FDA, allowing people like me to enjoy sex with more intimacy and less fear. And since people on PrEP are required to get tested every few months, the drug also created an architecture for detecting and treating other STIs. PrEP liberated younger gay men and other queer and trans people from the stress and fear around sex that remained even after the development of ARVs. Jafet, a 27-year-old graduate student from Los Angeles who asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that when he first moved to San Francisco for college, having sex without a condom would fill him with terror and anxiety. When sexual partners taught him about PrEP, which he has now taken for six years, he felt liberated. “I felt so privileged,” he said. “A generation before me didn’t have this freedom and luxury to enjoy sexuality without worry. And I felt lucky to be gay. I didn’t have to worry about a disease that is treatable but incurable,   I didn’t have to worry about pregnancy.” Jarret, a 21-year-old from Idaho who also asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that he had never had sex without PrEP. Growing up the son of a minister who railed against gay sex, he was terrified of his own desires. “I really grew up believing I wan’t going to live very long because I was gay,” he said. When he went away to college, he was afraid to do anything more than masturbate with another man – and even that would send him into a tailspin of “debilitating” anxiety about HIV. A therapist helped him get on PrEP, and he was able to have his first sexual experience without fear. “It was very profound,” he said. “Everything I had feared in my head was gone. I was able to enjoy myself and not stress.” But then, in 2020, the dreaded coronavirus came along, with  devastating effects for LGBTQ+ people . With breathing itself the major mode of transmission, techniques gay men were accustomed to using for safer sex, such as condoms, were no longer sufficient. Queer health educators instead  encouraged  people to practice masturbation, sexting, video sex or phone sex or to use “glory holes” in the early days of the pandemic. Covid-19 vaccines paved the way for a very horny summer of 2021 – but it was to be just one summer, because by Pride month in 2022,  monkeypox  was on the move. “With Covid, there was a quick government response,” noted Kotak. “With monkeypox, yet again, the queer community have had to push for a response.” In the absence of government help, gay sex parties cancelled themselves, and community groups mobilized to demand the government distribute  hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses  that it owned but had chosen not to make available. The outbreak is threatening all the progress that was made toward freeing gay men to have sex without fear. Jafet told me that he’s stopped having sex out of worry, “especially because monkeypox is so visual”. It frustrates him that he can’t find a vaccine “in the summer, on vacation, when I should be able to enjoy the boys safely!” When I spoke to Strong, he had been quarantined in Dublin for three weeks due to monkeypox. He had 50 lesions on his body. At times, it was so painful, he wanted to be hospitalized. Monkeypox has brought up a fear he once expressed to me about his HIV diagnosis: “I am terrified that no one will ever touch me again.” But in conversations he’s had on Grindr – “I’m still flirting and chatting, even though I’m quarantining” – he has been pleasantly surprised that some gay men have said: “Well, I’ll see you in a few weeks when you’re better.” “Our love of sex is going to save us,” he told me. “It’s going to teach us how to be human in an epidemic that wants to keep us apart”. The fight for our sexual freedoms is not without its enemies. This month, Jonathan Mitchell, an anti-abortion Republican and former solicitor general of Texas, filed a federal  lawsuit  seeking to limit access to PrEP. This attack on gay men’s sexual health is just one part of the misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic and anti-sex movement that is attempting to retract hard-won civil rights for women and LGBTQ+people in the US, from the overturn of Roe v Wade to the passage of the “don’t say gay” bill in Florida. Shame is heaped upon gay men, just as it is heaped upon transgender or gender-nonconforming people, people seeking abortions in the US, and people in poor countries needing medicines and vaccines. We must all navigate medicalized sex lives, and that puts us in solidarity with one another. When a virus like monkeypox moves in a way that can out us, the answer is not to shrink, or to hide, or to be embarrassed about the kind of sex we have. Rather, these times demand that we refuse to be relegated to a viral underclass – and compel us to destroy the conditions that created such an underclass in the first place.

Thai researchers test wastewater to track spread of monkeypox ,Rebecca Ratcliffe,2022-07-28 11:04:00,"Researchers in  Thailand  are examining wastewater for signs of monkeypox, as part of surveillance efforts to detect the spread of the virus. Academics from Naresuan University, in Phitsanulok province, northern Thailand, began testing sewage at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport in May, adopting a technique that has also been used to track the spread of Covid-19. Monitoring wastewater is thought to be a quicker, more cost-effective way to understand the spread of the monkeypox, compared with testing individuals. Monkeypox can be detected in the faeces of an infected person, even during the latent phases when they are not displaying symptoms, according to officials quoted by Thai media. Dr Thanaphon Penrat, of Thailand’s ministry of higher education, science, research and innovation, said there was no risk of sewage water spreading the disease: “The detection of monkeypox traces in sewage waste water is considered safe and there is no evidence of the possibility to get infected via sewage waste water. [It’s the] same as Sars-CoV-2, which can not be transmitted through sewage waste water.” The research, which is funded by a science research and innovation fund through the national research council of Thailand, did not find any traces of the virus when the project was piloted at Suvarnabhumi airport. Only one case of monkeypox has so far been identified in Thailand. The global monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), the strongest call to action the agency can make, last week, and has been detected in 78 countries. Previously, wastewater monitoring has allowed researchers to spot the arrival of new Covid strains before widespread outbreaks occur, allowing local areas to prepare health services. The arrival of the Delta variant in Phitsanulok and Yala provinces in Thailand was spotted 20 days before an outbreak occurred, while Omicron was earlier spotted 10 days in advance, officials told Thai media.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/thai-researchers-test-wastewater-to-track-spread-of-monkeypox,The Guardian
Spain reports first death in Europe related to monkeypox outbreak,,2022-07-29 20:42:00,"Spain has reported what is thought to be Europe’s first monkeypox-related death in the current outbreak of the disease. Brazil reported earlier on Friday the first monkeypox-related death outside  Africa  in the current wave. According to a World Health Organization report from 22 July, only five deaths had been reported worldwide, all in Africa. The WHO last Saturday declared the rapidly spreading outbreak  a global health emergency , its highest level of alert. In its latest report, the Spanish health ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country, only 64 of these were women. Of the 3,750 patients it had information on, it said 120 had been hospitalised and one had died. A spokesperson for Spain’s health ministry declined to give further details on the deceased person. The Brazilian victim was a 41-year-old man who, according to the health ministry, also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. “The comorbidities aggravated his condition,” the ministry said. It added that the patient was hospitalised in the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte and died from septic shock after being taken to the intensive care unit.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/spain-reports-first-death-in-europe-related-to-monkeypox-outbreak,The Guardian
San Francisco and New York state on emergency footing over monkeypox,Maanvi Singh,2022-07-29 16:50:00,"San Francisco officials announced a state of emergency on Thursday in response to an escalating number of monkeypox cases in the city and a national shortage of vaccines. “We are at a very scary place. And we don’t want to be ignored by the federal government in our need. So many leaders of the LGBT community have also, weeks ago, asked for additional help and support and assistance,” said San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, who added that the city was in “desperate need of vaccines”. The declaration will allow local authorities to mobilize more resources and staff to confront the outbreak and accelerate emergency planning. The city has recorded 261 cases so far, out of about 4,600 across the US, according to the San Francisco department of public health. “San Francisco is an epicenter for the country. Thirty per cent of all cases in California are in San Francisco,” said the San Francisco health officer Susan Philip. In a crisis that so far has disproportionally affected men who have sex with men, she added, “I’m issuing this declaration to reaffirm our commitment to the wellbeing of these communities and to allow us to move more quickly to obtain and distribute the resources needed to help those disproportionately impacted.” Also on Thursday, New York’s state commissioner of health, Dr Mary T Bassett, declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health. More than a quarter of cases in the US – 1,341 – are in New York, mostly  concentrated in New York City . Last week, San Francisco leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates protested in front of the US Department of Health and Human Services’ regional office against what they saw as a sluggish response to the monkeypox outbreak. “San Francisco was at the forefront of the public health responses to HIV and Covid-19, and we will be at the forefront when it comes to monkeypox,” state senator Scott Wiener, a representative of San Francisco, said in a statement. “We can’t and won’t leave the LGTBQ+ community out to dry.” No emergency closures or restrictions have been planned, as monkeypox spreads primarily through very close, skin-to-skin contact. But local health organizations in San Francisco have been advocating for easier, broader access to testing and more vaccine doses. These calls are echoed by leaders in other large cities, where  epidemiologists  warn that initial delays in rolling out tests mean that the actual number of cases very likely outnumber the confirmed cases. “In the face of a frustratingly slow federal response, it is all the more important that we be able to mobilize all available local resources to get vaccines into arms as quickly and equitably as possible,” San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman said. So far, San Francisco has received 8,200 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox. But officials had initially requested 35,000 doses to cover the most vulnerable residents. Residents have had to wait in long lines for scarce doses. “We should have been able to quickly control this outbreak,” Wiener  told the Guardian last week . “And instead it’s like Mad Max Thunderdome to get a vaccine.” Health workers argue that more local resources are needed to reach especially vulnerable residents, including unhoused populations. In  New York , Bassett said: “Based on the ongoing spread of this virus, which has increased rapidly and affected primarily communities that identify as men who have sex with men, and the need for local jurisdictions to administer vaccines, I’ve declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health throughout New York state.” New York City officials and other authorities nationally and internationally increasingly fear monkeypox  becoming uncontainable .",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/san-francisco-monkeypox-state-of-emergency,The Guardian

San Francisco’s LGBTQ+ leaders demand better access to monkeypox vaccines,Maanvi Singh,2022-07-21 11:00:00,"San Francisco leaders and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups gathered this week in front of the US Health and Human Services’ regional office to protest what they see as a sluggish response to the monkeypox outbreak. “There’s a lot of anger and it’s totally justified,” said state senator Scott Wiener, who joined protesters from the Alice B Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club, San Francisco Aids Foundation and Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club and other groups demanding increased access to monkeypox vaccines, testing and therapeutics for an outbreak that so far has been disproportionately  affecting  gay and bisexual men. In San Francisco, where prominent LGBTQ+ advocacy groups that 40 years ago led protests against a government that ignored and undermined the Aids crisis, “there’s a lot of PTSD in the community”, Wiener said. Gay and bisexual men are left once again wondering why their community is being failed by the federal government, he added. Although monkeypox has gained an initial foothold among networks of men who have sex with men, it could have taken off among any other social group, epidemiologists say. It can spread through very close contact, such as skin-to-skin contact including during sex, or by sharing infected items like clothing and bedding. “It doesn’t escape me that we’re once again in a moment where there’s a lack of urgency when a public health crisis is impacting cis and trans men as well as non-binary folks within the same social and sexual networks,” said Tyler TerMeer, CEO of the San Francisco Aids foundation. “And personally, as someone who is a Black gay man who has been living with HIV for 18 years, it is hard for me to not question whether or not there would be a more robust response to this outbreak if it first began spreading among another population.” For weeks, the leaders of local health organizations in San Francisco have been advocating for easier, broader access to testing and more vaccine doses. Their concerns have been echoed by leaders in other major cities, where  epidemiologists  warn that early delays in rolling out tests mean that the actual number of cases likely outnumber the confirmed ones. San Francisco tallied 141 cases of monkeypox as of Wednesday. Meanwhile, the city’s health department quickly said an initial allocation of 2,300 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox, was far from enough. This week, it will receive an additional 4,200 doses – a fraction of the 35,000 that were requested for its most vulnerable populations. A drop-in vaccine clinic at the San Francisco general hospital opened Wednesday, but said it has only 300 shots to offer each day. Christopher Artalejo-Price, a San Franciscan who works with the Aids foundation and in nightlife , said he made his way across the Bay Bridge to get his vaccine in Berkeley. He waited three hours during his first try – only to be told that the clinic had run out of doses, and then went back another day and waited eight hours before getting his shot. “I brought my lunch, and a bottle of water. I brought a charger for my phone – I had to take work calls while I was waiting in line,” he said. Those who were queued up traded tips on where to go nearby to use the restroom and held each other’s spots. “And I felt so lucky because I had a job where I could ask my boss for the time off to do this,” he said. “It was just a really humbling and sad moment.” In a letter to Xavier Becerra, the US Health and Human Services secretary, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and representative of San Francisco, said the current vaccine supply was “woefully inadequate”. The US has had a small stockpile of the vaccine, and has ordered millions more. But the factory that produces the vaccine has been shut since last August, due to a planned expansion, and shipments are expected to trickle in slowly. Public health experts have criticized the government’s reliance on a single manufacturer, and its failure to set up an alternative means of producing and stockpiling the vaccine ahead of the outbreak. San Francisco activists compared these delays and misjudgments not only to the early days of the Aids epidemic, but also to the US Covid-19 response – and initial delays in rolling out testing and guidance. “We should have been able to quickly control this outbreak,” Wiener said. “And instead it’s like Mad Max Thunderdome to get a vaccine.” Treatment for those who test positive also remains difficult to access, San Francisco healthcare and LGBTQ+ advocacy agencies said. To access TPOXX, an FDA-approved and stockpiled drug that may ease the sometimes severe symptoms of monkeypox, providers have to submit lengthy paperwork to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which many smaller hospitals and clinics don’t have the capacity to do. As a result, “members of the gay community have been messaging each other to try to find it and are growing increasingly angry that they cannot access the one drug that could ease the suffering of people with monkeypox”, wrote physician Jay K Varma and health activist Joseph Osmundson in  Stat , a health and medicine publication. Monkeypox is rarely fatal, but the disease can be very painful for some. And for those who have been exposed or infected, long isolation periods can be physically or economically infeasible. “We just can’t let this spread in our community,” Wiener said. Health workers and advocates also worry that the scarce options for testing and vaccination are leaving out gay and trans people in San Francisco who are unhoused, and those who cannot easily access information about health resources. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, health workers from the San Francisco Community Health Centre have been taking information, tests and vaccines out to the streets, to meet patients where they are, said the organization’s CEO Lance Toma. Smaller health centers and clinics working with marginalized communities will need the resources, access and funding to do the same with monkeypox tests and vaccines, he said. “We also just need to do more in terms of educating our patients about monkeypox, the risks, and how to stay safe – we have a lot of work to do,” he said, noting that one recent patient showing symptoms had very little awareness of the outbreak, and was diagnosed only after he came into the clinic for unrelated reasons. “The bottom line is that there’s been such a tepid response to this outbreak at all levels,” Toma said. “And I feel like the folks that we serve – especially folks who are homeless, the trans community, and even gay men of color – we’re always last in line for resources.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/san-franciscos-lgbtq-monkeypox-vaccine-access,The Guardian
‘I literally screamed out loud in pain’: my two weeks of monkeypox hell,Wilfred Chan,2022-07-23 19:07:00,"I got monkeypox and it’s been a total nightmare. When New York Pride festivities kicked off on 24 June, I was aware that monkeypox was an emerging issue – especially for  gay men  – but I was also under the impression that the number of cases in the city was relatively small. What I didn’t understand was how absolutely dismal testing capacity was: at that point, the city only had capacity to process  ten tests a day . I had sex with several guys over the weekend. Then a week later, on 1 July, I started feeling very fatigued. I had a high fever with chills and muscle aches, and my lymph nodes were so swollen they were protruding two inches out of my throat. First, I took a Covid self-test: negative. Then I started suspecting monkeypox. I texted a friend:  I’m a 39-year-old man from Sweden, living in Brooklyn and working in philanthropy. For the past decade, my work has primarily focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights, so I followed the outbreak from the very beginning. I had even tried to get vaccinated when New York City launched an  initial vaccination drive  on 23 June. But like the vast majority of other New Yorkers who tried to get an appointment, I had no luck. Two days after my symptoms began, the rash started as anorectal lesions – painful sores on my anus and rectum. Initially it was a stinging, itchy feeling. I wasn’t scared at this point. I was told that it would be mild, and I was a completely healthy individual with no underlying conditions. But I had no idea how bad it was going to get. I had a tele-health visit with my primary-care physician (PCP) and she agreed that I should get tested. So I went to urgent care. I had all the symptoms of monkeypox and thankfully nobody questioned whether or not I should receive a test. I also asked for a full STI panel. I wanted the antiviral drug that is being used to treat monkeypox, TPOXX, but you need a positive test result first. So they sent me home with Tylenol. ( European regulators  have approved TPOXX as an effective monkeypox treatment, but the FDA has only approved it to treat smallpox. The  CDC  maintains a stockpile of TPOXX and allows for its “compassionate use” during monkeypox outbreaks.) After I went home, the rash started spreading, and I began to feel anxious. I developed lesions literally everywhere; they started out looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would eventually pop, then finally scab before leaving a scar. I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back, and five just on my right elbow. At the peak, I had over 50 lesions, a fever of 103F and intense pain, prompting a panic attack. Ironically, the only place I didn’t have lesions was my penis. The next day I got my STI results: positive for gonorrhoea. But no word yet on monkeypox. That’s when I developed hives everywhere on my body from my neck down, as well as a headache, arthritis pain in my fingers and shoulders and a strange pain in my shin bone that got so painful that I couldn’t stand up. At night, I would wake up going crazy with both pain and itching from the lesions and hives, just sitting up in bed and scratching myself. I was isolated, lonely and frustrated with how unfair the situation was. I was clearly very sick, yet had to cobble together a care plan on my own. My anorectal lesions, which were already very painful, turned into open wounds. It felt like I had three fissures right next to each other, and it was absolutely excruciating. I would literally scream out loud when I went to the bathroom. Even keeping the area clean, like washing myself, was extremely painful. It was a two hour process each time. Four days after my test – I got a call from urgent care that I had tested positive for monkeypox. But they gave me no information beyond that. So I started calling around to see how I could get access to the antivirals  I knew the CDC had put out  guidance  around who should be considered for treatment, and that included people who had anorectal lesions, lesions in the throat and dermatological conditions, which I did. But I was just referred in circles. I would call urgent care, who told me to contact the department of health. The department of health would say, “Oh no, your PCP has to request treatment for you.” Then I would contact my PCP, and they were like, “We can bring the case to the department of health, but just so you know, they deny most of our requests, so don’t get your hopes up.” Then my throat started swelling up. My tonsils were covered in white pus. I did a video with someone in my PCP’s office and they said, “I think you should go to the ER.” The ER determined it was bacterial tonsillitis, and they gave me a round of antibiotics. But when I asked them for antivirals, they said they wouldn’t give them to me because they only gave it to people who were severely immunocompromised. I told them, “That’s not the CDC treatment guidelines.” They wouldn’t have it, and they discharged me at 2 am. I was incredibly demoralized. The next evening, I finally got a call from a clinic at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center. They said DoH had asked them to take on my case. So that was apparently how I was one of the lucky few to be invited for treatment. Because the drug hasn’t been extensively tested in humans, there’s quite a significant informed consent and intake process. I spent about an hour at the clinic and walked out with a two week supply of TPOXX. I was so relieved. You have to take three pills every 12 hours, with a high fat diet. I’m eating a lot of bacon and whipped cream, which is the second best thing about this treatment. The lesions started drying out very quickly and I’m now down to just three tiny little scabs left. Only in the last couple of days have I been able to go to the bathroom without pain. I’m still in isolation. I can’t tell you how sick of my apartment I am right now. I’m a pretty privileged person in that I have the resources necessary to order food and medicine and get it delivered to my door. I have laundry in my apartment, so I can wash my bedsheets and clothes. I know other people who are really struggling with isolation because they don’t have the situation I have. The day after I started the treatment, 13 July, I finally got a call from a contact tracer from the department of health, who said I may have been exposed to monkeypox on 26 June. I told her I already have monkeypox, and she asked me about my symptoms. The call lasted about half an hour and she was obviously reading off a script. Then she was like, “Okay, thanks for your time, get well,” and hung up. She didn’t even ask me what contacts I’d had. This whole thing just feels like a huge failure that should not have been allowed to happen, especially not two and half months into the outbreak. If someone like me, who has worked in sexual health for a long time, had such a hard time navigating care, I can’t imagine other people doing it. I know several people who are just sitting at home in agonizing pain because they’re not getting the support that they need. I’m pretty worried that we’re close to the point that this is going to be another endemic disease, especially among gay men, if we haven’t passed that point already. I’m worried we’ll be stuck with it forever.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/i-literally-screamed-out-loud-in-pain-my-two-weeks-of-monkeypox-hell,The Guardian

"US to distribute 800,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine after weeks of delay",,2022-07-27 19:24:00,"After weeks of delays, nearly 800,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine will soon be available for distribution, US health regulators said on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, it was reported that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to make the rapidly spreading disease a nationally notifiable condition, a move that would streamline reporting of cases. Through the designation, which will probably take effect on 1 August, the agency will direct all states to share surveillance data, including case numbers,  Politico said , citing people with knowledge of the matter and a letter sent to state epidemiologists on Monday. States will be required to report confirmed or probable monkeypox cases within 24 hours, Politico said. State health departments are not yet required to provide the federal government with standardized data on monkeypox. More than 3,500 monkeypox cases were reported in the US as of Tuesday, according to the CDC. Joe Biden could  declare the disease a public health emergency  by the end of the week, insiders told Politico. That would allow access to additional funds and expand staffing. The announcement that more doses of vaccine are on the way came amid growing criticism that authorities have been too slow in deploying the vaccine, potentially missing the window to contain what could become an entrenched infectious disease. Nearly two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had finished inspections at Bavarian Nordic’s facility in Denmark, where the company fills vials of the vaccine. The FDA said on Wednesday the certification had been finalized. The doses are already in the US “so that they would be ready to be distributed once the manufacturing changes were approved”, the agency said. The US has sent more than 310,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine to state and local health departments. But clinics in San Francisco, New York and other large cities say they don’t have enough shots. The head of the US Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday officials would announce more allocations on Thursday. Monkeypox mainly spreads through skin-on-skin contact but it can also transmit through touching linens used by someone with the infection. The vast majority of cases reported have been in men who have sex with men, though health officials have stressed that anyone can catch the virus. People with monkeypox may experience fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. Many in the outbreak have developed zit-like bumps on many parts of the body. The sluggish federal response has drawn comparisons to the initial days of the Covid outbreak. Experts had pointed out that the US had one huge advantage: more than 1m doses of vaccine in the strategic national stockpile. But it turned out US officials had only about 2,000 doses on hand when the outbreak was identified in May. Shipping and regulatory delays have meant only a portion of the rest were deployed. “There’s not enough doses,” said Perry Halkitis of Rutgers University. “I think with some quicker action on part of federal government we might not be in the situation we are now.” The doses previously shipped came from a separate facility in Denmark that had FDA clearance. Another 786,000 doses made at a newly opened Bavarian Nordic facility were awaiting the US certification announced on Wednesday. The FDA requires inspections of all vaccine manufacturing plants to assure safety, sterility and consistency of production. US officials announced orders this month for 5m more doses, though most of those are not expected to arrive until next year. Officials have recommended the shots be given to people who know or suspect they were exposed to monkeypox in the previous two weeks. The Jynneos vaccine has never been widely used in response to an outbreak like this, and the government will track how well it’s working.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/us-monkeypox-vaccine-delay-health,The Guardian
,Wilfred Chan,2022-07-22 11:00:00,"But Staley’s years of criticizing the nation’s decision makers on health crises, particularly as part of the legendary Aids pressure group Act Up New York, have brought him into the fold. As the co-founder of the group  PrEP4All , Staley has the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Rochelle Walensky, “on speed dial”. He regularly emails with the National Security Council’s pandemic chief, Raj Panjabi. And he has become  close friends  with Dr Anthony Fauci, who he says frequently turned to him for advice during the coronavirus pandemic. Those friendships are now being tested as Staley sounds the alarm on the federal government’s response to monkeypox, which he calls a “fucking mess”. “We’re close to the point where we’re wanting to call for the resignations of people we consider friends,” he told me by phone on Wednesday. “Unlike what a lot of people are saying, it’s not Aids 2.0, where we have a government filled with homophobes who don’t care about us. But it is Covid 2.0. It’s basically a copy and paste.” Monkeypox is a viral disease that can cause  symptoms  including fever, headache, body aches and lesions across the body. It has been prevalent in parts of central and western Africa, where it was first discovered in humans in the 1970s. After a small outbreak in the US midwest in 2003, it did not appear in the country again until 17 May this year, in what’s now a rapidly growing epidemic. Most of the confirmed cases so far are among men who have sex with men, although anyone can contract it through close physical contact. PrEP4All, which was formed to fight for access to HIV medication in the tradition of Act Up, has become one of the main players pushing US officials to speed up the nation’s monkeypox response, Staley told me. As such, it has also been an important witness to what he sees as the government’s repeated blunders. “The CDC, the FDA, and all of it – they haven’t learned a single lesson from Covid. They haven’t spent the time to make sure that they don’t repeat those mistakes, because all of them have been repeated.” The government’s first “fuck-up” with monkeypox, Staley says, was not ensuring adequate tests. By late May, initial tests with gay men were coming back more than 50% positive. “That means you’ve got a huge problem. So we screamed at the CDC.” But as with the early days of the coronavirus, the CDC insisted on running all testing, locking out private health companies. Officials from other health agencies promised Staley they would push the CDC, Staley said, but to little effect. “We got strung along.” The CDC finally  announced  it would allow commercial testing on 22 June – but the  tests  remain very difficult to get. The second failure was with the vaccines. There are two vaccines for monkeypox: the older one is designed for smallpox, but is known for dangerous side effects. The newer one, Jynneos, is a very effective two-shot vaccine developed in 2003 and manufactured by a small Danish company called Bavarian Nordic. But that shot is in short supply around the world. In early June, top officials assured Staley that the US had in place a stockpile of 1.2m doses of the vaccine, thanks to a Trump-era order by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda), the wing of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for managing the country’s vaccine reserves. The problem was most of those doses weren’t ready. Just 68,000 of the doses were already located in the US; the rest were in freezers in Denmark awaiting shipment. Worse, two-thirds of the doses in Denmark had been manufactured on a new factory line that the FDA hadn’t inspected – which meant the vaccines produced on it couldn’t be used, despite approvals from the FDA’s EU counterpart, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Activist groups held their fire based on private assurances that the vaccines were on their way, Staley says, but by late June, it was clear “the promises were obviously not true.” “If we had moved all 400,000 [FDA-approved doses] in June, we would have avoided a huge spread of monkeypox over Gay Pride,” he says. “All the cities would have had plenty of supply.” At the same time, the CDC began recommending the vaccine be used for post-exposure treatment of infected people instead of pre-exposure immunizations – which would reduce the number of doses needed. Staley compared the move to the agency’s guidance not to wear masks at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. “The CDC developed that policy because they were told we have very limited supplies. That’s the scandal. Everything is Covid 2.0.” “The most important response during any new epidemic is right upfront in the first weeks or months, or for something that spreads slowly like Aids, in the first few years,” says Staley. “You got to basically take a pillow and try to snuff out that epidemic right upfront so that you’re not dealing with something that’s huge within a few weeks or a few months or a few years.” But officials have fumbled that opportunity, he says. The CDC and the FDA did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Staley’s criticisms. On 7 July, the  FDA announced  that it had started inspecting the Bavarian Nordic plant. That day, Staley and PrEP4All members were finally able to hear from FDA official Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which inspects vaccine safety. But the exchange reminded Staley of meeting FDA staff as a protester in 1988. “We were hit by a wall of FDA arrogance, which it’s famous for: ‘This is how we do things, and this is why we do things, and you all don’t know how it works.’ They told us directly that they simply think that they are the best in the world at this and that the EMA is not quite there yet. And they won’t say why.” The exchange left him feeling angry and discouraged. “What’s more important, us feeling superior to the EMA or getting this vaccine here? There’s just nobody acting like this is a fucking emergency.” The US government is now working to expedite the shipment of vaccine doses from Denmark, and it is  reportedly reorganizing HHS  to elevate a department focused on pandemic and disaster response to the same level as the CDC and FDA. If all goes well, there should be as many as one million monkeypox vaccine doses in the United States within a month’s time. But that’s a big if. Staley says he’s still looking for clear answers, and that he has noticed his communication is “beginning to degrade with people at the top” as he’s stepped up his criticism. But if he has one regret, it’s that he and other activists didn’t blast them sooner. “We dropped the ball,” he tells me. “We just should have stayed in screaming mode every step of the way.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/22/peter-staley-monkeypox-response-us-interview,The Guardian
"More than 1,000 monkeypox cases confirmed in New York City",Sam Levine,2022-07-26 16:01:00,"There are now more than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in New York City, which continues to be a hotspot for the virus, health officials  said on Monday . New York reached 1,040 cases as of Monday, said the most recent information released by the city. That accounts for about a quarter of all of the confirmed cases in the US. The US  leads the world  in confirmed cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). As of Monday, there were 3,846 confirmed cases in the US and 18,095 globally, the CDC said. The World Health Organization (WHO)  declared the outbreak  a public health emergency on Saturday. The virus is spreading primarily among men who have sex with men, research has shown. Close sexual contact was responsible for transmission in 95% of cases,  one recent study found . There  is a divide  in New York City’s health department over whether the agency should advise gay men to change their sexual behavior amid the outbreak. Even as cases in New York have surged,  officials have struggled  to respond with adequate vaccination and testing. At the end of June, as New Yorkers scrambled to get a limited supply of monkeypox vaccines, there were 300,000 doses sitting in a warehouse in Denmark, the New York Times reported on Monday. Then, once officials decided to send those doses to the US, they arrived slowly, missing a chance to slow the spread of the virus. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, also announced on Monday that the state had  reached an agreement  with Quest Diagnostics to use a PCR test on people who have a rash consistent with monkeypox. “The real challenge with testing is that it involves swabbing lesions, which must be present for the test to assess whether the virus is also present,” the New York state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said in a statement. “Without lesions, testing is not currently possible. And we will continue working to make sure providers know when and how to test for monkeypox.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/more-than-1000-monkeypox-cases-confirmed-new-york-city,The Guardian
Monkeypox declared disease of ‘national significance’ in Australia,Paul Karp,2022-07-28 04:01:00,"Australia has declared monkeypox a “communicable disease incident of national significance” and has updated guidelines for who should get immunised ahead of newer vaccines being made available. On Thursday the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, revealed that there have been 44 cases of the disease in Australia, mostly in returned international travellers, people aged 21 to 40 years and men who have sex with men. Following  a declaration by the World Health Organisation earlier in July  labelling monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern, Australia declared it a communicable disease incident of “national significance”. The declaration means the response to monkeypox will have national coordination, in order to assist states and territories with outbreaks. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [Atagi] also updated its  clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox  to include the use of a MVA-BN vaccine named Jynneos to prepare for supplies arriving in Australia. “Limited supplies of … [MVA-BN Jynneos] have been secured by the commonwealth and some states and territories,” it said. It is unclear if these supplies have arrived in Australia, with demand high globally. The health minister, Mark Butler, told Guardian Australia earlier this week that the federal government had “been actively pursuing supplies of the third-generation vaccine MVA-BN well before the WHO declaration was made, recognising there is limited supply and significant global demand”. Health stakeholders believe an announcement of a supply deal for the newer vaccination is imminent. Monkeypox can also be prevented with a smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, which is registered for use in Australia and contained in the national medical stockpile, but that vaccine uses a weakened live pox virus called vaccinia, making it unsuitable for the immunocompromised. Jynneos has been recommended as the preferred vaccine, saying it can be administered to the immunocompromised, pregnant women, children and those with skin conditions. Heath Paynter, the deputy chief executive officer of the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations, said the government needs to “implement policies to arrest the virus and to prevent it becom[ing] endemic”. “Fundamental to this is to obtain a supply of vaccines for gay and bisexual men at risk of monkeypox,” he told Guardian Australia. “It is our expectation the government will acquire and supply MVA-BN, which is the only vaccine that is safe and effective.” “It is the only acceptable option,” he said, labelling ACAM2000 “inferior”. “Australia has a golden opportunity to step in and stop monkeypox in its tracks, but it could quickly evaporate, and once it does – it’s lost, as we’ve seen in Montreal, London, New York and Madrid, cities with hundreds of cases of community transmission.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Atagi advice states that “For healthy non-pregnant adults, where Jynneos is not suitable or not available, ACAM2000 has an established profile and may be considered” for those exposed to the virus or at high risk of exposure. In his update, Kelly said according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1 January to 28 July there had been 20,311 monkeypox cases in 71 countries that have not historically reported it, including Australia. The fact most cases have been in returned travellers indicates community transmission in Australia has been limited. Despite the declaration on Thursday, Kelly said it was important to note monkeypox “is far less harmful than Covid-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic”. Monkeypox is “far less transmissible” than Covid-19, he said. Monkeypox results in rashes and flu-like symptoms which Kelly said are “relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments”. “Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” he said. “The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people.” Kelly said since May the Department of Health had worked with at-risk communities, states and territories to ensure “our response to MPX [monkeypox] has been swift and coordinated”. The national medical stockpile has available stock of monkeypox treatments, such as antivirals, for states and territories to access on request, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/monkeypox-declared-disease-of-national-significance-in-australia,The Guardian
Monkeypox: WHO chief advises at-risk men to reduce number of sexual partners,,2022-07-27 18:15:00,"The head of the World Health Organization has advised men at risk of catching monkeypox to consider reducing how many sexual partners they have “for the moment”, after the UN agency declared escalating outbreaks in multiple countries  to be a global emergency . The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said 98% of the monkeypox cases detected since the outbreaks emerged in May had been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. He called for those at risk to take steps to protect themselves. “That means making safe choices for yourself and others, for men who have sex with men,” Tedros said. “This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners.” Infectious individuals should isolate and avoid gatherings involving close physical contact, while people should get contact details for any new sexual partners in case they needed to follow up later, the WHO chief said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not suggested that men who have sex with men reduce their sexual partners, only that they avoid skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that could be monkeypox. WHO officials emphasised that monkeypox could infect anyone in close contact with a patient or their contaminated clothing or bedsheets. The health agency has warned the disease could be more severe in vulnerable populations such as among children or pregnant women. More than 19,000 cases have been reported in more than 75 countries; deaths have only been reported in Africa. “We know very clearly that one of the main modes of exposure for this particular illness is through direct contact, close contact, skin-to-skin contact, possibly even face-to-face contact, exposure to droplets or virus that may be in the mouth,” Dr Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead for monkeypox, said. Andy Seale, a WHO adviser on HIV, hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections, said experts had determined the monkeypox outbreak was “clearly transmitted during sex”, but he said they had not yet concluded whether or not it was a sexually transmitted infection. Seale stressed that the messaging around the need for gay and bisexual men to reduce their number of sexual partners was “coming from the communities themselves”. But he said this was possibly only “a short-term message as we hope that the outbreak of course will be short-lived”. Dr Hugh Adler, who treats monkeypox patients in the UK, said the virus was being transmitted during sex and that sexual networks and anonymous sex with untraceable partners were facilitating its spread. “It’s just as likely that monkeypox was always capable of transmitting and presenting like this, but it hadn’t been formally reported or so widespread before,” he said. Last week British authorities issued new guidance advising doctors that people with just one or two lesions might be infectious with monkeypox, potentially complicating efforts to stop transmission. The European Union health commissioner urged the bloc’s 27 member nations on Wednesday to step up their efforts to tackle outbreaks in the EU, which she called “the epicentre of detected cases”. In a letter to European health ministers obtained by the Associated Press, Stella Kyriakides called for “reinforced, concerted and coordinated action”. “There is no time for complacency and we need to continue working together to control the outbreak,” she wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/monkeypox-who-chief-advises-at-risk-men-reduce-number-sexual-partners,The Guardian

Monkeypox declared global health emergency by WHO as cases surge,Nicola Davis,2022-07-23 15:15:00,"The global monkeypox outbreak has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the  World Health Organization  (WHO) – the strongest call to action the agency can make. It is the seventh time such a declaration has been made since 2009, the most recent being for Covid-19, which was given  the same label by the WHO in 2020 , and follows a meeting of a committee of experts on Thursday. A public health emergency of international concern – or PHEIC – is defined by the WHO’s international health regulations as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. The UN health agency said the term implies the situation is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected, that it carries implications for public health beyond national borders, and that it may require immediate international attention. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said at a press conference that the committee met on Thursday to review the latest data, but that they were unable to reach a consensus. However, he has since decided to break the deadlock by declaring a PHEIC. “In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,” he said. “For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” While he said the risk of monkeypox was “moderate” globally, it was “high” in Europe and there was “a clear risk of further international spread”. Globally, there have so far been 16,016 monkeypox cases – 4,132 of which were in the past week, according to  WHO data . It is now in 75 countries and territories and there have been five deaths. The European region has the highest number of total cases, at 11,865, and the highest increase in the last seven days, with 2,705. Dr Rosamund Lewis, the technical lead for monkeypox at the WHO health emergencies programme, said: “There’s a lot of work to be done.” She said action must be taken to establish what causes risk and to reduce situations that could put people at risk so they can protect themselves. “This is how we will get to the end of this outbreak,” she said. Monkeypox is a viral infection  typically found in animals in central and western Africa, although it can cause outbreaks in humans. Cases are occasionally identified in countries where the virus is not endemic, but the latest outbreak has been unprecedented. While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico among others. The WHO said the outbreak was largely among men who have sex with men who had reported having sex recently with new or multiple partners. However, experts have stressed that anyone can get monkeypox as it is spread by close or intimate contact, with the  UN having warned that  some media portrayals of Africans and LGBTQ+ people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”. Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO emergencies programme, said: “We all know how difficult it has been historically to deal with issues like this because of stigma.” “If nothing else this is about enlightened self-interest,” he added, as well as “solidarity” with those affected.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/monkeypox-who-declares-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern,The Guardian
What is monkeypox and how worried should we be?,Nicola Davis,2022-07-23 17:11:00,"The  monkeypox outbreak has been declared a global health emergency  by the World Health Organization. While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico, among others. Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in central and western Africa. Cases, usually small clusters or isolated infections, are sometimes diagnosed in other countries, including the UK where the  first case was recorded in 2018  in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria. There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo strain. The current international outbreak appears to involve the west African strain, although not all countries have released such information. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks. Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets. “Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.” Globally, there have so far been 16,016 monkeypox cases – 4,132 of which were in the past week, according to  WHO data . It is now in 75 countries and territories and there have been five deaths. The European region has the highest number of total cases, at 11,865, and the highest increase in the past seven days, with 2,705.

However, experts have stressed that anyone can get monkeypox as it is spread by close or intimate contact, with the  UN having warned that  some media portrayals of Africans and LGBTQ+ people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”. The west African strain of monkeypox is generally a mild infection for most people, but it is important those infected and their contacts are identified. The virus is more of a concern among vulnerable people such as those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant. ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/what-is-monkeypox,The Guardian
"New Zealand reports second monkeypox case, unrelated to first",Tess McClure,2022-07-12 02:33:00,"New Zealand has reported its second monkeypox case in a matter of days, but health authorities say the second has no link to the first. The latest infection comes shortly after New Zealand’s first case, which was reported over the weekend, but the ministry of health said there was no evidence so far of community transmission. Worldwide, the World  Health  Organization (WHO) had reported 6,027 cases as of 7 July, with infections up 77% since the previous report on 27 June. Monkeypox is already  spreading in Australia , with 11 cases reported in New South Wales, but the largest outbreaks are in Europe, which accounts for 80-90% of current cases. According to the UK Health Security Agency,  there had been 1,552  confirmed cases of monkeypox as of 7 July – a figure that suggests  case numbers are doubling every 15 days . The WHO is due to meet by 18 July to consider whether monkeypox constitutes a global public health emergency. That designation – the highest level of global alert – applies only to Covid-19 and polio at present. According to  WHO guidelines , monkeypox symptoms are often mild, and usually last from two to four weeks. Severe cases can occur, however, and estimates of case fatality ratio range from less than 1% to 6%. The WHO has reported three deaths since the start of the year. A spokesperson for the ministry of health said the first case, a person in their 30s, lives in Auckland and had recently returned from overseas travel in a country with reported cases of monkeypox. The second case, also with a record of overseas travel, is isolating in the northern region. “We have already taken steps to prepare for the arrival of monkeypox. Last month monkeypox was officially listed as a notifiable disease, enabling us to utilise the tools needed to contain any possible spread of the disease including isolation orders and readying contact tracing capabilities,” the spokesperson said. While anyone can catch the virus through close contact, the outbreak in Europe so far has been clustered around men who have sex with men. According to the latest WHO update, more than 99% of the cases for which gender information was available were among men. “International cases have been clustered around events where this occurs,” the ministry spokesperson said. “As such we are asking anyone who’s been overseas and attended events connected with the spread of monkeypox to be aware of any symptoms and seek advice.” Smallpox vaccines offer protection against monkeypox, and in the US and UK governments are making plans to distribute vaccine doses to try to stem the spread and protect those most at risk.

US ramping up monkey pox vaccine distribution to slow down spread,,2022-06-29 02:07:00,"The US government is ramping up efforts to staunch the spread of monkeypox by sending hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses to states in the coming months, expanding access for those most at risk and increasing supply to areas with high case numbers. The plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine – which has so far been limited – to prevent monkeypox in areas with the highest transmission and need. State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions’ ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised. The  Biden administration  will allocate 296,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories in the coming weeks, with 56,000 allocated immediately and 1.6m doses made available over the coming months, officials said. The United States has 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions. Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread. “As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials had been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox. The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of CDC’s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading. The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said.

Monkeypox: US reports its first cases of virus in children,,2022-07-23 03:28:00,"Cases of monkeypox have been identified in the United States for the first time in children – a toddler in California and an infant who is not a US resident, health authorities say. The two cases of the viral disease were unrelated and were likely the result of household transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Friday. The agency said the children were in good health and being treated. Monkeypox, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, has been spreading largely in men who have sex with men in the recent outbreak, outside the central and west African countries where it is endemic. The disease spreads chiefly through close contact. So far this year, there have been more than 14,000 cases of monkeypox in more than 60 countries, and five deaths in Africa. Speaking on a conference call, Dr Jennifer McQuiston, the deputy director of the CDC’s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology, said it was not a surprise that pediatric cases of monkeypox had emerged, but “there is no evidence to date that we are seeing this virus spread outside” the communities of gay, bisexual and other men who had sex with men. She said 99% of the 2,891 monkeypox cases confirmed in the US involved men who have sex with men, but there had been a handful of women and transgender men who had become infected. The White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, speaking on the same call, said the government had delivered 300,000 doses of a monkeypox vaccine and was working to expedite the shipment from Denmark of 786,000 more doses. He said there was already enough vaccine on hand to provide a first vaccine dose to more than half of the eligible population in New York City and more than 70% of the eligible population in Washington DC. The fatality rate in previous outbreaks in Africa of the current strain has been about 1%, but so far this outbreak seems to be less lethal in the non-endemic countries. However, a number of patients have reported being hospitalised for severe pain. Jha said the US was still evaluating whether the monkeypox outbreak should be declared a public health emergency. “We’re looking at that, looking at what are the ways in which the response could be enhanced, if any, by declaring a public health emergency.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/23/monkeypox-us-confirms-first-cases-of-virus-in-children,The Guardian

Monkeypox: Schiff demands to know why US does not have more vaccines,,2022-07-24 17:57:00,"The California Democrat Adam Schiff, a leading critic of the US response to the monkeypox outbreak, said on Sunday: “I don’t know why there aren’t more vaccines available.” Speaking a day after the World Health Organization director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the rapidly spreading outbreak was a global health emergency, Schiff said he wanted “to light a fire under the administration”. The WHO label – a “ public health emergency of international concern ” – is designed to trigger a coordinated international response and could unlock funding to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments. On Sunday, the Biden administration’s Covid response coordinator, Ashish Jha, told CBS’s Face the Nation: “I applaud the WHO for declaring that public health emergency of international concern. “We are seeing outbreaks that are out of control in many, many parts of the world. It’s very important that we get our arms around this thing.” Monkeypox spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions. In  a first-person account for the Guardian , Sebastian Köhn, who contracted monkeypox in New York City, said: “I developed lesions literally everywhere. “They started out looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would eventually pop, then finally scab before leaving a scar. I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back, and five just on my right elbow. At the peak, I had over 50 lesions, a fever of 103F and intense pain, prompting a panic attack.” Tedros, who cast the deciding vote in favor of declaring a public health emergency of international concern, said the risk of monkeypox was moderate globally, except in Europe, where the WHO has deemed the risk to be high. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Tedros said: “Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.” He added: “Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.” Jha said: “In the US right now, we’re looking at public health emergency as something [the health department] might … invoke but it really depends on what does that allow us to do. “Right now we have over 2,000 cases, but we have ramped up vaccinations, ramped up treatments, ramped up testing, and we’re going to continue to look at all sort of policy options. Right now, we think we can get our arms around this thing but obviously if we need further tools we will invoke them as we need them.” Schiff and other prominent critics have called for more access to testing and vaccines, amid claims the US was caught flat-footed. Jha said: “What I would acknowledge is that when we started two months ago, we had a limited supply of vaccines. We have obtained more than any other country, probably more than every other country combined. We have acted swiftly. We’ve gotten 800,000 doses from Denmark … just in the last week. “We’re going to be getting those out in the upcoming couple of weeks. So what I would say is this is a virus that we have known for, you know, 60 years, we had the vaccine and diagnostic capabilities to manage it. But, we have substantially ramped up that response, and that is now I think being felt in localities around the country.” Schiff appeared on the same show. His host, Margaret Brennan, said: “You said the federal response falls short in terms of supply and timeliness, regarding a vaccine. The current supply accounts for only three and a half million residents. Some shipments are not even expected to arrive until 2023. Why do you think the federal response is failing when Dr Jha says it’s contained and under control? Schiff said: “I don’t know why there aren’t more vaccines available. I’m hearing from healthcare providers in my district that there are people lining up to get vaccinated and they don’t have the vaccines for them, and that is a real problem. “We really don’t know the future course of this virus. But what we do now, early on, just as was the case with the [Covid] pandemic, will determine just how bad this may get. “And so I want to light a fire under the administration and get them to make sure that we up production, that we up distribution and that people that are ready and willing and able to get vaccinated have the ability to protect themselves.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/monkeypox-schiff-us-vaccines,The Guardian
"No room for complacency over monkeypox, says WHO",Nicola Davis,2022-07-01 17:59:00,"There is no room for complacency around the monkeypox outbreak, the  World Health Organization  has said, noting that cases in Europe have tripled in just over two weeks, with some infections identified in children. In a statement issued on Friday, Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, called on governments and the public to increase efforts to prevent the disease from extending its geographical reach. “Urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease,” he said. According to Kluge, more than 90% of confirmed cases in the latest outbreak have been in the Europe region, with cases reported in 31 countries and areas. He said confirmed cases across the region had more than tripled since 15 June, reaching more than 4,500. Most cases for which information is available have been in men who have sex with men, although some have been identified in other demographics, including in children. Last week it was disclosed that the outbreak would not yet be classed as a public health emergency of international concern, but Kluge said the committee involved would revisit its position shortly. The label was used for Covid-19, which declared a PHEIC by the WHO on  30 January 2020 . “In the meantime, WHO continues to assess the risk of monkeypox in the European region as high,” he said. While Kluge said no confirmed cases had died, 10% have been hospitalised for treatment or for isolation purposes, and one had been admitted to an intensive care unit. “There is simply no room for complacency, especially right here in the European region with its fast-moving outbreak that with every hour, day and week is extending its reach into previously unaffected areas,” he said, adding the stigmatisation of men who have sex with men in some countries was compounding the challenge. Data from the  UK Health Security Agency  released on Friday showed that as of Thursday, there had been 1,235 confirmed cases in the UK, up from 1,076 confirmed by last Sunday. Dr Sophia Makki, an incident director at UKHSA, urged people participating in Pride events on Saturday to check for blister-like spots and rashes. “If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested,” she said. “Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks, especially if you are having sex with someone new. To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/no-room-for-complacency-over-monkeypox-says-who,The Guardian
"Efforts to curb UK monkeypox outbreak inadequate, warn experts",Nicola Davis,2022-07-11 16:19:00,"Monkeypox is continuing to spread in the UK, with current efforts insufficient to curb the outbreak, experts have warned as a whistleblower claimed there were serious flaws in the support given to those who think they have been exposed. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA),  there have been 1,552  confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK related to the outbreak as of 7 July. While anyone can catch the virus as it is spread through close or intimate contact, the majority of cases so far have been among gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Within England, the majority of cases have been in London. There is little sign of infections fizzling out, with the latest estimates from UKHSA suggesting  case numbers are doubling every 15 days . “[There is] no evidence that current strategies are likely to bring this to an end anytime soon,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, although he noted that while total case numbers were continuing to rise, the rate of new infections may have plateaued. The concerns came as a whistleblower working on a UKHSA monkeypox inquiries line said it had numerous issues, including offering little support for people who are not confirmed contacts of cases – ie somebody whose name has been provided to contact tracers by a person with monkeypox.  The Guardian has seen scripts that show even if someone calls because they are worried they may have had a contact with a confirmed case, they are told their risk is very low if they have not been formally identified as a contact. The whistleblower said that made little sense when a caller has said a sexual partner has monkeypox symptoms. In addition, the whistleblower said call handlers were not allowed to suggest callers contact a sexual health clinic unless sexual health was brought up by the caller, They added that some clinics had turned off their phone lines. The UKHSA has rejected the claims, saying the phone line is an additional service to provide non-clinical advice to members of the public. Dr William Welfare, the agency’s incident director, said specialist public health teams were rapidly following up all cases to limit transmission, with contacts assessed as high risk offered vaccination. “Contact tracing has often relied on people sharing contacts for a high number of sexual contacts, so can inevitably be difficult when also taking into account confidentiality. We have rapidly implemented a high-quality public health operation with sexual health services to investigate and control monkeypox, and to support those affected,” Welfare said. “Monkeypox is predominantly being spread by very close contact, most prominently through relatively closed sexual networks, and has not been found routinely in the wider population. The prevalence of infection overall in the UK and therefore the risk to the general public currently remains low.” Vaccination involves a smallpox jab that also offers protection against monkeypox. The UKHSA  recently announced it would broaden eligibility for vaccination  to include some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to the virus even if they were not a confirmed close contact of a case. The UKHSA confirmed there was a ready supply of vaccine, with almost 30,000 doses procured, but said the NHS had yet to announce plans for the rollout of the jab. A NHS spokesperson, said: “The NHS is working with local partners to identify and invite those who are eligible for a vaccination to come forward, and over the coming weeks will rapidly grow the number of clinics to make it as quick and convenient as possible to get vaccinated. “Following UKHSA advice, the NHS will continue to prioritise vaccination for those at greater risk, including healthcare workers in specialist roles and clinics where exposure to Monkeypox is highest.” But Hunter said an even broader approach may be needed. “I think wider vaccination of high-risk MSM – people who have frequent multiple contacts – and maybe female sex workers are the way forward,” he said. “We may not have enough vaccine to do this but I think there could be a case to offer vaccine to everyone attending an STD [sexually transmitted diseases] clinic.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/11/efforts-to-curb-uk-monkeypox-outbreak-inadequate-warn-experts-whistleblower-claim-helpline,The Guardian
"UK monkeypox outbreak not yet under control, say experts",Nicola Davis,2022-06-19 09:58:00,"The monkeypox outbreak in the UK is not yet under control, experts have warned, with some suggesting that vaccines may need to be offered to all men who have sex with men. Monkeypox,  which is to be given a new name  by the World Health Organization (WHO), is typically found in west and central Africa, but an unprecedented outbreak in recent weeks has resulted in cases appearing in a host of countries from France to Canada and Australia. It is understood the WHO will hold a meeting next week to decide whether to label the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. As of 12 June, 470 cases had been identified in the UK, including a rise of 104 cases reported in England  last Monday . Experts are warning further action may be needed to curb the rise. “At the moment there is no clear evidence that the current epidemic is coming under control,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. Cases so far have predominately been found among men who are gay or bisexual or otherwise have sex with men – although experts have raised concerns around particular communities becoming stigmatised, stressing anyone can get monkeypox and that it is spread between humans through close contact. A smallpox vaccine that also offers protection against monkeypox is available, with current guidelines advising jabs should ideally be given to close contacts of cases within four days of exposure to monkeypox to prevent or lessen the impact of infection, although in some circumstances it can be  given to individuals up to 14 days after exposure  to reduce symptoms should infection have occurred. “I guess that if we do not see this coming under control very soon, then we are looking at offering vaccination to all men who have sex with men, and possibly female sex workers,” said Hunter. Prof Jimmy Whitworth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine also raised concerns. “These numbers of new cases suggest that we are not yet getting the monkeypox epidemic under control,” he said, although he cautioned it was necessary to look at the trend in cases over a longer period, while it could take a week or two before the number of new cases fell once transmission was under control.  But Whitworth said it was clearly a very challenging outbreak to control. “There seem to have been some superspreading events that have enabled infections to spread rapidly into many different countries, and there are chains of transmission that suggest that there might have been some cases without any obvious signs of infection which has allowed further spread which has not been detected,” he said.  Hunter said there were probably many factors at play. “The thing that worries me the most is that for a disease whose transmission may have significant stigma for some is that people may not be fully honest about their contacts and if that is the case then a public education and a ring vaccination strategy approach may not be sufficient,” he said, adding another concern was how well contacts were adhering to the self-isolation period. “For someone who is not openly gay having to self-isolate for 21 days would be tantamount to coming out,” Hunter said, noting the situation was sensitive and complex, particularly for bisexual men who have not come out to their female partners. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), individuals who have been tested are usually informed of their result within 24 hours, with contacts identified and followed up with as soon as possible, and vaccination offered if appropriate. However, the agency  has flagged challenges with the outbreak,  noting: “Most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners, sometimes in the context of cruising grounds or during chemsex, frequently where contact details were unavailable for tracing.” Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said public health teams in the UK and internationally had done an excellent job, both with contact tracing and reporting as well as accurate and sensitive public health messaging. Head said there was a small signal in UK data that the outbreak was slowing down – although this was not yet certain – while the lack of infections within the wider community showed transmission relied on very close contact.  “This is less complex to address than, for example, a Covid-19 outbreak, and gives encouragement that the outbreak will be brought to an end in the coming weeks or months,” he said. Dr Hugh Adler of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said there could be a positive view of the rising case numbers. “Maybe this is [reflecting] that the public health messaging is getting out and people are presenting for assessment,” he said. Adler said vaccination was not appropriate for all contacts of cases, particularly if they did not have close or intimate contact. Instead such individuals can be monitored for possible symptoms. “Their risk is so low that vaccination wouldn’t be the right thing for them anyway, because of our limited supplies of the vaccine, as well as side-effects,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/uk-monkeypox-outbreak-not-yet-under-control-say-experts,The Guardian
"UK orders more doses of monkeypox vaccine as cases pass 2,000",Ian Sample,2022-07-19 18:42:00,"Public health officials have ordered 100,000 more doses of vaccine to help curb the spread of monkeypox as the number of UK cases rose to more than 2,000 in the months-long outbreak. According to figures released by the  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) on Tuesday, confirmed cases have risen to 2,137 in the UK, with 2,050 recorded in England. The majority of infections are in London and among men who have sex with men. Despite the continued growth in cases, health officials have revised their guidance for close contacts of confirmed monkeypox cases, no longer requiring them to isolate at home if they do not have symptoms of the disease. The decision was made in light of new data that showed only a small number of close contacts of confirmed cases have gone on to develop monkeypox, and a lack of evidence for transmission beyond intimate or sexual contact, the UKHSA said. Further doses of the Imvanex smallpox vaccine, which is effective against monkeypox, are due to arrive from the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, this month, and more are expected by September. The NHS is contacting people eligible for the vaccine, including men who are more likely to catch the virus. “We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow,” said Dr Merav Kliner, a deputy incident director at the UKHSA. “Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms.” While the advice was changing, Kliner said, monkeypox remains a “serious public health challenge” and she urged contacts of confirmed cases to “take a break from any activities or events involving skin-to-skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing, to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly”. She urged people to stay alert to the symptoms of monkeypox and call a sexual health clinic if they become unwell. Early symptoms of monkeypox include a high temperature, headache, muscle aches and swollen glands. A rash or blisters usually appear, which can then spread around the body. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: “Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/19/uk-orders-more-doses-of-monkeypox-vaccine-as-cases-pass-2000,The Guardian

CDC activates emergency operations unit for monkeypox,Samira Asma-Sadeque,2022-06-29 20:56:00,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has activated an emergency operations unit for monkeypox that signals the initial stages of a public health concern. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC), was activated on Tuesday to boost operational support for addressing a monkeypox outbreak. For reference, the EOC was  activated for Covid-19  in January 2020, on the same day as the first coronavirus case was  detected  in the US. “The EOC activation is helping to further supplement the ongoing work of CDC staff to respond to this outbreak,” said Scott Pauley, a press officer with CDC. “Clinicians and public health departments already reach out to CDC to report and investigate monkeypox cases,” he added. There are currently 300 CDC staff members working on monkeypox with local and state-level medical personnel, and the EOC is expected to enhance those measures. As of Monday, CDC recorded  306 cases  of monkeypox across 28 states, with the highest numbers in California and New York, respectively. Currently, there are 66 cases in California, 63 in New York, and 45 in Illinois. The other states, for the most part, have fewer than 10 cases reported. Epidemiologist and health economist Dr Eric Feigl-Ding  noted  on Tuesday that the expected number of monkeypox cases by August is 100,000 worldwide, and urged the World Health Organization to take action. Earlier, on Sunday, WHO said while the global rate of the monkeypox spread is alarming, it  does not  yet raise alarms for a global emergency. On Monday, the White House  announced  that the administration is allocating nearly 300,000 vaccine doses, with an estimated 1.6m doses available over the next few months.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/cdc-emergency-operations-unit-monkeypox,The Guardian
‘It’s taken so long’: Monkeypox patients raise concerns over UK tracing delays,Nicola Davis,2022-06-19 10:31:00,"With the  monkeypox outbreak continuing in the UK , some of those affected have raised concerns over delays and difficulties in contact tracing and vaccination. Joel* told the Guardian he had sought advice on testing and vaccination after becoming aware a close contact had been exposed to monkeypox and had developed symptoms. However, Joel said he struggled to access testing in London over the jubilee bank holiday and was turned down for a vaccine, initially being told it was only available to healthcare staff. Joel was subsequently confirmed as a close contact of a monkeypox case by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and was told he should have been offered the vaccine. However the delay meant he was no longer eligible for the jab. Current guidelines suggest the vaccine should ideally be given within four days of exposure to prevent or lessen the impact of infection, although it can be given to high-risk individuals  up to 14 days after exposure  to reduce symptoms. Joel said the process had caused him anxiety, noting one concern in the community was whether monkeypox could leave those infected with permanent scars, adding that with LGBT events that include anonymous sex continuing to go ahead it seemed likely monkeypox would keep spreading. “It has taken so long for [public health bodies] to trace [close contacts] that they are going to have to get out and effectively proactively vaccinate a lot of at-risk groups to stop this,” he said. Joel said he was initially told to self-isolate for 21 days but was unable to do so for financial and mental health reasons, noting he was self-employed and, in addition, did not wish those he worked with to know he was bisexual. He has subsequently tested positive for monkeypox, and has been asked to self-isolate until all scabs drop off. According to the UKHSA, individuals who have been tested are usually informed of their result within 24 hours, with contacts identified and followed up with as soon as possible, and vaccination offered if appropriate. However, the agency itself  has flagged challenges , “as most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners, sometimes in the context of cruising grounds or during chemsex, frequently where contact details were unavailable for tracing”. Matt*, who also lives in London, said he had had sex with a man who later contacted him to say he was experiencing symptoms and had been in contact with a confirmed case. When Matt rang 111, he was advised to isolate for 21 days but was not offered a vaccine because his contact was yet to be tested and confirmed as a case. “Desperate” to get the vaccine before he potentially started experiencing severe symptoms, he told a contact tracer he had been in touch with the confirmed case and was vaccinated five days after the sexual encounter took place. By the time he was tested three days later, he had five lesions. “The doctor said I had one of the mildest cases he’d ever seen, and when I said I’d had the vaccine, he said that was probably why,” said Matt. But while he was not critical of the response from healthcare staff, who he said were “doing their best with a limited number of doses”, he said he thought the UKHSA’s public messaging around the disease needed to change. “They don’t seem to be taking into account how quickly it can spread within networks of gay men where people have lots and lots of sexual partners,” he said. Adding that prior to being infected he could have up to 20 sexual partners a week, Matt noted that within spaces such as saunas or “cruise bars” few people exchange details. “If you tell people off too much, they’ll just ignore it. But one thing they could say is, if you’re going to carry on having sex with lots of people, get their phone number so one of you can contact the other,” he said. “It’s a short-term change that seems like it would make a lot of sense.” The UKHSA told the Guardian that in addition to mandatory sick pay, in special circumstances, local authorities may grant discretionary payments to those isolating to mitigate community transmission of a high-consequence infectious disease. The agency said vaccines were offered on a case-by-case basis. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “A decision on whether or not to offer a vaccine to a close contact of a confirmed monkeypox case is a clinical one made by trained health protection teams who carry out detailed assessments of each case. This includes the specific details of the exposure and the individual’s risk level. Currently, the Imvanex vaccine is only offered to close contacts with higher risk exposure, and decisions are taken on a case by case basis.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/monkeypox-patients-raise-concerns-uk-tracing-delays,The Guardian
WHO to rename monkeypox virus to avoid discrimination,Ian Sample,2022-06-15 14:20:00,"The  World Health Organization  has said it will rename monkeypox to avoid discrimination and stigmatisation as the virus continues to spread among people in an unprecedented global outbreak of the disease. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said the organisation was “working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of the monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes”. The move comes after scientists  called for an “urgent” change to the name  which they described as “inaccurate”, “discriminatory” and “stigmatising” in a report released last week. An announcement on the new name would be made “as soon as possible”, said Tedros. Similar concerns were raised at the height of the coronavirus pandemic when new Covid variants were named after the countries or regions where they were first detected, leading to travel bans and other restrictions. In response, the WHO brought in a naming system that referred to new variants as letters of the Greek alphabet. In the report, the scientists raise concerns that the “prevailing perception” in the media and scientific literature is that monkeypox virus is endemic in humans in some African countries, whereas the virus is overwhelmingly found in animals, which have historically sparked occasional outbreaks when they infect people. The scientists warn of “an increasing narrative in the media and among many scientists that are trying to link the present global outbreak to Africa or west Africa, or Nigeria”. While the UK  Health  Security Agency first raised the alarm after a person with monkeypox arrived in London from Nigeria on 4 May, the virus had already been spreading for some time, predominantly among men who have sex with men. The WHO currently refers to two types of monkeypox, namely the “west African” and the “Congo basin (central African)” clades. This year’s outbreak is driven by the former type, which is substantially less dangerous than the latter. “In the context of the current global outbreak, continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising,” the experts write. They go on to criticise the use of photos of African patients with pox lesions in coverage of the outbreak in the global north. In the report, the scientists use the name “hMPXV” for human monkeypox virus as a placeholder to distinguish the virus driving the current international outbreak in humans from the virus most commonly found in animals. On Wednesday, the WHO’s Europe director, Dr Hans Kluge, said the magnitude of the outbreak “poses a real risk”, telling a media briefing: “The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach and the stronger the disease’s foothold will get in non-endemic countries. He called on “governments, health partners and civil society” to “act with urgency” to “control this outbreak”. At the same briefing, Steve Taylor, a board member at European Pride, said LGBTQ+ events must not be closed down in light of the outbreak, but instead used to spread public health messages about monkeypox. He said about 750 Pride events were due to take place in Europe this summer. “We have been working with the WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves,” he said. “Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. “We are pleased the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging,” he added. The UKHSA announced 52 more cases of monkeypox in England on Wednesday, one more in Scotland and a further case in Wales, bringing the UK total to 524 as of 14 June. More than 1,800 cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in dozens of countries outside Africa in the latest outbreak. The UKHSA urged people to contact a sexual health clinic if they developed a rash with blisters and they had been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have had monkeypox in the past three weeks, or had been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks. The WHO will convene an emergency meeting of experts on monkeypox next week to advise on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, meaning it requires a coordinated response.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/15/who-to-rename-monkeypox-virus-to-avoid-discrimination,The Guardian
Monkeypox vaccines rolled out more widely in UK as cases near 800,Nicola Davis,2022-06-21 18:04:00,"Vaccines will be offered more widely to people at higher risk of getting monkeypox, in an attempt to help control the unprecedented outbreak in the UK. Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)  reveals that up to 20 June  there were 793 laboratory-confirmed cases in the UK, up from 574 on 16 June – a 38% rise in just four days. While anyone can catch the virus as it is spread between humans through close contact, the UKHSA states that most cases have occurred in men who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with men. Now the UKHSA says it is broadening eligibility for vaccination, saying it will begin offering jabs to some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox, even if they are not a confirmed contact of a case. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said it is hoped the move will help to control the outbreak. “Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak,” she said. The UK has secured thousands of doses of a smallpox vaccine, a jab that also offers protection against monkeypox. Initially the vaccine was only offered pre-exposure to healthcare workers, and to contacts of cases at high risk of infection – with it ideally given to the latter within four days of exposure, although in some circumstances it can be  given up to 14 days after . However, the Guardian has previously reported that some contacts of cases have experienced  difficulties and delays in accessing vaccination . Experts have also raised concerns, with  some saying the outbreak is not under control  and vaccines may need to be offered to all men who have sex with men to combat the spread of the virus. Among other factors, some have noted that stigma around monkeypox may be making contact tracing difficult, while the UKHSA has also highlighted challenges including that contact details are not always available for tracing those who may have been exposed. While details have not yet been released about exactly who is now eligible for the jab, the UKHSA said a number of factors would be involved in the criteria, suggesting vaccination may be advised, for example, for someone who participates in group sex. “Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet,” said Ramsay. “In the meantime, everyone should continue to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they’ve had close contact with a new partner,” she said. “If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending.” Robbie de Santos, director of communications and external affairs at Stonewall, welcomed the shift in strategy. “It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others. Let’s help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy Pride season,” he said. The jabs will also be made more widely available pre-exposure to workers in laboratories where pox viruses are being handled, as well as a broader range of healthcare staff.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/21/monkeypox-vaccines-uk-cases-near-800,The Guardian
Fears two monkeypox cases were transmitted locally and could mark spread of disease in Australia,,,"Monkeypox may be spreading in Australia after  New South Wales  found infections among the state’s 11 confirmed cases that could have been transmitted locally. NSW  Health  says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. “People need to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, which can include fever, headache, body aches and a rash or lesions on the genital area,” NSW Health executive director of health protection Jeremy McAnulty said on Wednesday. He said the cases had not exhibited severe symptoms, such as an extensive rash or lesions all over the body. But McAnulty warned even minor symptoms such as pimples in the genital area or buttocks needed to be taken seriously. “The virus is mainly spread through skin-to-skin contact … It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity.” Monkeypox occurs mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in humans in 1970. The illness can be transmitted from person to person through air droplets, close bodily contact or sharing contaminated linens or objects. Australia has joined a growing list of nations affected by the rare tropical illness including Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and the UK. There is no room for complacency around the current outbreak, the  World Health Organization  said earlier this month, noting cases in Europe tripled in just over two weeks, with some infections identified in children. In a statement on 1 July,  Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe , called on governments and the public to increase efforts to prevent the disease from extending its geographical reach. “Urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease,” he said. According to Kluge, more than 90% of confirmed cases in the latest outbreak have been in the Europe region, with cases reported in 31 countries and areas. He said confirmed cases in the area had more than tripled since 15 June, reaching more than 4,500. Most cases for which information is available have been in men who have sex with men, although some have been identified in other demographics, including children.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/06/fears-two-monkeypox-cases-were-transmitted-locally-and-could-mark-spread-of-disease-in-australia,The Guardian
"Majority of UK’s 366 monkeypox cases are in London, says health agency",Denis Campbell,2022-06-10 20:42:00,"Four-fifths of the people in England who have been infected with monkeypox live in London, an  investigation  by the UK Health Security Agency has found. Of the cases interviewed, 99% of those infected are men and their median age is 38, the agency added after analysing 336 of the 366 confirmed cases found in the UK since the outbreak began last month. The same overwhelming majority of cases – 99% – involve men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men, the UKHSA said. Interviews it has conducted with 45 men with monkeypox specifically about their sexual health found that 44% had visited “sex-on-premises venues” in the UK or abroad, such as saunas, sex clubs and dark rooms, while they were incubating the infection. In addition, 64% had met new sexual partners during their incubation period through a dating app. Incubation lasts anywhere between five and 21 days. Tracing all the sexual partners of men who have contracted monkeypox will be hard, the UKHSA admitted, as “most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners … where contact details were unavailable for tracing”. The UKHSA report is based on close scrutiny of the history of the 336 laboratory-confirmed cases that had been identified in the UK by 8 June, including detailed questionnaires that 152 cases filled in. That total rose to 366 on Friday. “A high proportion of England cases were known to be  London  residents”, it said, adding that 224 of 276 people for whom they had a home address lived in the capital. In terms of their sex, 311 of 314 confirmed cases were men, with three women. The UKHSA said the median age of those infected was 38, though that was based on analysis of the middle half of all those affected, who were aged between 32 and 44. “Findings show that monkeypox is being transmitted in geographically diffuse sexual networks”, the report added. Among the 45 interviewed 98% had had sex with other men during the incubation period. In that group 60% had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection during the previous year, 44% had had more than ten sexual partners in the preceding three months and the same proportion had taken part in group sex while the infection was incubating. “Sexual networks involved in this outbreak are interconnected both within and without the UK”, the UKHSA said. Among the 45 cases, 30% had had sex in a city outside their usual place of residence, 20% had taken part in sexual activity abroad and 24% had had sex with men who were not UK residents. Health officials hope that sex-on-premises venues will agree to implement “targeted interventions [which] would support outbreak control”, to try to reduce the risk of further transmission of the monkeypox virus. The agency’s “early evidence and preliminary analyses” also say that the number of detected cases so far means that the outbreak in England is at level 2 of four levels. That is defined as “transmission within a defined sub-population with high numbers of close contacts”. However, with numbers rising, officials are monitoring it for signs that it has reached level 3 – “transmission within multiple sub-populations or larger sub-population”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/majority-of-uks-monkeypox-cases-are-in-london-says-health-agency,The Guardian

Monkeypox: US experts issue warning amid limited vaccines and testing,Victoria Bekiempis,2022-07-18 16:13:00,"As health authorities in the US  warn  that  monkeypox  must be taken more seriously, at-risk communities continue to face a limited supply of  vaccines  and lack of access to testing, while those contracting the virus in the US have struggled to receive treatment, according to reports. “This is something we definitely need to take seriously. We don’t know the scope and the potential of it yet, but we have to act like it will have the capability of spreading much more widely than it’s spreading right now,”  Anthony Fauci , Joe Biden’s top medical adviser,  said  on CNN this weekend. Scott Gottlieb , the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, told CBS’s Face the Nation: “I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. And, if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close.” There were 1,814 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the US as of Friday afternoon,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Fauci and Gottlieb both expressed their belief that the actual numbers were higher – and stressed the need for testing. Fauci said the data was “very likely an undercount”. He told CNN: “Whenever you have the emergence of something like this, you are always probably looking at what might be, might be, we don’t know, the tip of the iceberg, so that’s the reason why we’ve got to get the testing out there in a much, much more vigorous way.” Gottlieb said that the authorities are probably detecting “just a fraction” of cases. “We had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested and by and large, we’re looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics… But it’s a fact that there’s cases outside that community right now. We’re not picking them up because we’re not looking there,” Gottlieb said. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted virus; it spreads “through close, physical contact between individuals”, according to the  New York state health department , which added: “This means anyone can get monkeypox. However, based on the current outbreak, certain populations are being affected by monkeypox more than others, including men who have sex with men.” More than 132,000 doses of  vaccine against monkeypox  have been taken out of the US strategic stockpile and sent across the country, but health authorities estimate that more than 1.5 million US residents qualify for this two-dose vaccination,  according to CNN . The US has ordered almost 7 million doses, but the majority will not arrive for months, leaving many at risk, Forbes  reported . New York City, for example, “does not have sufficient vaccine supply to reach the number of people who need it [to] protect themselves”, health department officials  said  Friday. The city has now seen 461 cases of monkeypox, as the location of the greatest number of confirmed US cases. Monkeypox patients have described numerous barriers in accessing care. Gabriel Morales  told  the New York Times that it took him nine hours of inquiries just to secure a test. After Morales returned home, he never received a phone call with his results and worked to obtain antiviral treatment and pain medication. “It was just the worst pain I’ve experienced in my life,” Morales told the newspaper.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/monkeypox-vaccines-testing-us-latest-warning-threat,The Guardian
"UK records 77 more cases of monkeypox, taking total to 302",Nicola Davis,2022-06-06 15:49:00,"The current outbreak of monkeypox in the UK has topped 300 cases, official figures reveal, as contacts who have a rash with blisters are asked to contact a sexual health clinic. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), 77 more cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK, 73 of which are in England and two each in Scotland and Wales. The figures bring the total identified in the UK, as of 5 June, to 302, with 287 in England, 10 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and three in Wales. Typically found in central and west Africa, monkeypox has cropped up in recent months in myriad countries where it is not endemic, including the UK, Australia, France, Canada and Israel. While it appears the current outbreak involves the west Africa strain of the virus, which is less serious than the Congo strain, the situation has caused concern given both the number of cases involved, and evidence of community spread. The UKHSA reiterated that, at present, “most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men”, although the agency stressed that anyone could catch monkeypox, particularly if they have close contact with a symptomatic person. Last month  the United Nations’ Aids agency raised concerns  that the LGBTI community could experience stigma as a result of some of the media portrayals of cases that it has called “racist and homophobic”. Most people shrug off the virus after a few weeks, but monkeypox can pose a greater risk to pregnant people, children and those with weakened immune systems. Among the symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and a rash with blisters. The UKHSA reiterated on Monday that anyone who has developed such a rash and has either returned from west or central Africa or been a close contact of a confirmed or suspected monkeypox case in the past three weeks should contact a sexual health clinic. However, experts, while concerned, have stressed that the risk for the general public remains low. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about,”  said Dr Sylvie Briand , the WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief, on 28 May. “It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/uk-records-77-more-cases-of-monkeypox-taking-total-to-302,The Guardian

US raises monkeypox alert level but says risk to public remains low,Ramon Antonio Vargas,2022-06-07 14:00:00,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised its monkeypox  alert level  and warned travellers to be mindful of approaching sick people, though it also said the risk to the general public remained low. More than 1,000 monkeypox cases have been reported in at least  29 countries  and every continent except Antarctica as of Monday. The US has seen 31 cases of the virus in  13 states , including seven in New York and six in California. Many of the infected had not recently travelled to the areas of Africa where monkeypox usually occurs, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other parts of central and western Africa, the CDC said. Some of the cases involved people living with an infected person. Investigators have been examining whether at least some cases in the current outbreak may be spreading through sexual contact. The CDC urged travelers to avoid close contact with sick people – especially those with lesions on their skin or genitals – and their bedding or clothes. Others with whom to avoid contact included dead or live rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes, since the virus that causes monkeypox often comes from rodents and primates. The CDC also cautioned against eating or preparing meat from wild game, known as bushmeat, or using creams, lotions or powders derived from animals in Africa. “Risk to the general public is low,” the CDC said. “But you should seek medical care immediately if you develop new, unexplained skin rash (lesions on any part of the body), with or without fever and chills, and avoid contact with others.” At one point on Monday  the CDC  told travelers to “wear a mask” as it “can help protect you from many diseases, including monkeypox”, according to a screenshot posted on Twitter by epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, but the recommendation no longer appeared on the CDC’s website on Tuesday. The monkeypox virus does not spread easily between people, though transmission can occur through contact with an infected person’s body fluids, sores, contaminated bedding and clothes, and respiratory droplets during face-to-face contact. The virus has a slow incubation period, and those exposed to it can be given existing smallpox vaccines to limit severity of any sickness.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/monkeypox-cases-cdc-alert-level-us,The Guardian
"England records 104 new monkeypox cases, bringing total to 452",Nicola Davis,2022-06-13 15:02:00,"The number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in  England  has risen by 104, official figures reveal, the largest reported increase so far. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) , the new cases bring the total identified in the UK, as of 12 June, to 470, with 452 in England, 12 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and four in Wales. The virus is typically found in central and western Africa. However, in recent weeks cases have been identified in myriad countries around the world where it is not endemic, with experts voicing concerns over the number of cases and evidence that it is spreading in the community. At present it appears the outbreak involves the milder west African strain of monkeypox rather than the more serious Congo strain. However, while the virus is typically shrugged off by most people in a matter of weeks, people who have weakened immune systems, who are pregnant, or who are children are at greater risk from monkeypox. The rise in confirmed cases in the England from 348 as of 9 June to 452 as of 12 June marks the largest uptick in cases in the country to date, with an average over the three-day period of almost 35 cases a day. The UKHSA added that to date, the majority of cases had been in men who were gay, bisexual or had sex with men. However, the agency stressed that anyone could get monkeypox, noting it is spread by close contact. On Friday the UKHSA released a technical document  revealing that the outbreak was currently at the second of four levels of transmission, meaning spread of monkeypox was “within a defined sub-population with high number of close contacts”. The report added that the majority of cases were in London and among men, with most cases identified in people who had not recently travelled to a country where monkeypox was endemic. The UKHSA has continued to urge people to contact a sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have had close contact in the past three weeks with someone who either has or may have monkeypox. People with such a rash who have been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks should also contact a sexual health clinic, the agency advised. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “The public health teams in the UK and internationally have done an excellent job, not just with the contact tracing and reporting, but also with accurate and sensitive public health messaging. We don’t want any populations to feel stigmatised, but there is also an urgent need to raise awareness of signs of monkeypox among high-risk individuals, and to encourage early reporting of symptoms.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/13/england-records-104-new-monkeypox-cases-bringing-total-to-452,The Guardian
Fifth case of monkeypox discovered in New York City,Victoria Bekiempis,2022-06-03 19:36:00,"A fifth person has tested positive for monkeypox in New York City, local health authorities  announced  on Thursday,  saying  “we are monitoring the situation and will investigate any other suspected cases”. This positive test was revealed the same day the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reported  that there have been a total of 21 confirmed monkeypox cases across the US in 2022. As of late Thursday afternoon, the CDC  reported  there were 790 confirmed cases in 28 countries. These monkeypox cases have emerged as the world continues to reel from the Covid-19  pandemic , which has killed more than 6 million globally, with 1 million fatalities in the US since 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University  data . New York City health authorities have noted that the likelihood of contracting monkeypox remains low, but that protective actions could be taken. “Monkeypox is rare in New York City but we can prevent the spread,” the health department said. Health officials noted that monkeypox is spread through “direct contact” with an infected animal or person, and that human-to-human spread is unlikely, usually taking place due to “open sores, body fluids or large respiratory droplets”. Sexual activity and talking closely are among the ways monkeypox might be transmitted, they said. The means of preventing monkeypox are similar to protective measures against Covid-19, such as masking around others and washing hands, as well as avoiding contact with people who might have monkeypox, officials said. Rosamund Lewis, the World Health Organization’s monkeypox technical lead, has said it is unclear how long the virus has proliferated outside the several African countries where it’s endemic. “We don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain,” Lewis said,  according to CNBC . “What the WHO and all member states are trying to do is prevent onward spread.” Several public health experts told the Guardian that monkeypox is not poised to become a pandemic like Covid, given the virus’s characteristics. “It’s a slower-moving picture than we see with Covid. First of all, the incubation period is longer, time between generations is greater,” said Brian Labus, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Public Health. “Second, it doesn’t spread as easily and third, we don’t see asymptomatic cases. With Covid, that’s always the challenge – you have people who are spreading it and don’t even know it. “If you get infected, you get the disease,” Labus said. “We’re talking about an illness that causes a problem with your skin. It’s a pox virus. It causes pustules on your skin.” Jessica Justman, associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, said: “My own stance in all of this is: I’m paying attention, and I think that’s what I would communicate to others – I certainly don’t think we need to panic.” Justman noted that epidemiologists and other public health professionals had an understanding of monkeypox, including their experience studying the virus in countries where it is endemic. “It does not cause enormous numbers of disease there,” Justman said. And while many fewer people are vaccinated against smallpox than in years prior, large numbers of older adults were vaccinated, which may convey some protection against monkeypox, Justman explained. “I wouldn’t put it in the category that we should all be actively worried about this,” Justman also said, adding, “Let’s all pay attention and see how this is evolving.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/monkeypox-cases-new-york-city-cdc,The Guardian
"Monkeypox may have been circulating in UK for years, scientists say",Ian Sample,2022-05-25 17:34:00,"Public health officials have confirmed seven more cases of monkeypox in England, bringing the UK total to 78, as scientists said the virus may have been circulating unseen for several years. The sudden surge in monkeypox, which is usually found in west and central Africa, has been recorded in at least 20 countries in the past month, with more than 200 confirmed cases and dozens more under investigation. It is the first time the disease has spread in the community outside Africa, with all previous cases associated with travel to regions where the virus is endemic or to imported animals harbouring the virus. The largest number of confirmed cases are in the UK, where health protection teams are isolating people who test positive and their closest contacts and offering smallpox vaccinations, which are cross-protective against monkeypox. A substantial proportion of cases are among men who have sex with men (MSM). As efforts continue to contain the outbreak, scientists are working through how the disease came to flare up in so many countries in such a short space of time. Many suspect that monkeypox was circulating at low levels, undetected, in the UK or Europe for several years before it reached the MSM community and flared up. Prof David Heymann, who chairs a World  Health  Organization expert group on infectious threats to global health, said it was possible the virus entered the UK two or three years ago and spread under the radar. Between 2018 and 2019, four confirmed cases of monkeypox arrived in the UK, all recent travellers from Nigeria. Three further cases with similar travel history arrived in 2021. “It could hypothetically be that the virus transmission amplified from this low level of transmission when by chance it entered the population that is at present amplifying transmission,” Heymann said. He stressed it was one of many hypotheses that needed further study before any conclusions could be drawn. Genetic studies on monkeypox viruses taken from people in the ongoing outbreak show a close resemblance to the virus that reached the UK, Israel and Singapore from Africa in 2018 and 2019. They also carry mutations that may have arisen as the virus then circulated at low levels. While the UK’s first official case of 2022 arrived from Nigeria on 4 May, the virus was already in the country. On 14 May the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) released images of monkeypox, and doctors in sexual health clinics realised some of their patients could have the disease. The patients had tested negative for common infections and doctors suspected a condition called disseminated gonococcal infection, before the patients tested positive for monkeypox. “This may be a virus that’s been circulating undetected for quite a while,” said Prof Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium. “They all have a common ancestor and that common ancestor probably dates back to 2019, though it’s too early to date with any kind of accuracy.” It is unclear whether mutations seen in the virus make the strain more transmissible in humans, but scientists point to the virus having evolved while infecting humans. “We know that chronic infection is not a plausible scenario, and that means there has been a chain of transmission events that apparently went unnoticed,” Van Ranst said. The Covid pandemic may have played a role, as people had less contact with GPs and other health services during the crisis. Asked if the outbreak might not have come to light if sexual health clinics had not been alerted by the first UK case, Van Ranst said: “It’s entirely possible.” Prof Oyewale Tomori, a virologist and adviser to the Nigerian government, said more studies were needed to understand what is happening. “Perhaps it was spreading silently within the community until we had this flare-up following some of the changes in behaviour we’ve seen,” he said. “Between 2019 and 2020 if anybody came up with a rash in any part of Europe, you’re not going to think of monkeypox, your thought would be other diseases that cause a rash. “And if the system misses that one case, then of course that’s an opportunity for it to spread from one person to another. I think the amplification came where you have a lot of people gathering with very close contact.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/monkeypox-may-have-been-circulating-in-uk-for-years-scientists-say,The Guardian
"Monkeypox outbreak was waiting to happen, say scientists",Ian Sample,2022-05-24 23:30:00,"The unprecedented surge in monkeypox cases in the UK and beyond was an outbreak waiting to happen after the end of global smallpox vaccination more than 40 years ago, scientists say. The UK  Health  Security Agency announced a further 14 cases in England on Tuesday, bringing the total to 70, and one further patient in Scotland. No cases have been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. Routine smallpox vaccination wound down in most countries before 1980 when the World Health Assembly declared the disease eradicated. Because the vaccine also protects against monkeypox, the campaign had kept that disease in check too, notably in regions of central and western Africa where the virus is endemic. In the decades since smallpox vaccination ended, the proportion of people protected against monkeypox has fallen substantially, allowing the virus to spread more easily from animals into humans and from person to person, fuelling the risk of a major outbreak. “This outbreak was really waiting to happen,” said Dr Romulus Breban, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Mathematical modelling by Breban and his team in 2020 found that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, immunity to monkeypox fell from 85% in the early 1980s to 60% in 2012. With declining immunity, monkeypox posed “an ever-increasing threat for health security”,  he wrote  at the time. In 2020 the DRC had more than 4,000 suspected cases and at least 171 deaths. “Our immunity level is almost zero,” Breban said. “People aged 50 and above are likely to be immune but the rest of us not, so we are very, very susceptible.” He believes the outbreak can be contained and said it was an opportunity to propose vaccination campaigns in countries where the virus is endemic. Until this year only a handful of cases of monkeypox had ever been spotted in the UK, all linked to travel from Nigeria. Since the first UK case of 2022 was announced on 7 May, nearly 300 suspected or confirmed cases have come to light in at least 16 countries. The surge in cases has raised questions about whether the monkeypox virus has evolved into a more transmissible form. So far scientists have found no evidence for this being the case, but researchers are studying the DNA to see if mutations in the virus may have changed its behaviour. Genetic studies so far suggest the virus matches strains that reached the UK, Singapore and Israel in 2018 and 2019. Prof David Heymann, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House’s global health programme, said the outbreak appeared more of a chance event, with the virus being amplified once it got into a community of men who have sex with men. Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there was unlikely to be the same “explosive growth” of infections into the general population that was witnessed with Covid. But he said the outbreak could continue for several months as contact tracing slows but does not stop transmission. “As with Covid, we can expect twists and turns as monkeypox outbreaks continue,” he said. “At the moment the transmission chains are mostly within sexually active younger men, but there are other settings where there is sufficient contact for monkeypox to spread. The longer the outbreak continues and the higher the prevalence, the more likely that monkeypox will find these other niches.” Researchers in the UK have revealed promising yet tentative signs that an antiviral may help to reduce illness from the virus. In a  study  published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, four of seven patients diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021 were given either brincidofovir or tecovirimat, drugs developed to treat smallpox. Findings from the three patients given brincidofovir suggest the drug provided little clinical benefit and did not appear to reduce the duration of the illness. However, the one patient treated with tecovirimat had a shorter hospital stay and appeared to shed virus, detected by PCR tests, for a shorter period of time. Dr Hugh Adler, a co-author of the study at Liverpool university hospitals NHS trust, said that although only one patient was involved, the result for tecovirimat was “a promising signal”. “Now that we’re seeing more cases, unexpectedly, we think it’s important to share,” he said. “This is the sum total of human experience with these drugs and monkeypox so far.” The UK has secured a supply of tecovirimat and is offering a smallpox vaccine to close contacts of people diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Sources suggest an  extra 20,000 doses of the vaccine  have been ordered to add to the UK’s stock of 5,000.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/monkeypox-outbreak-was-waiting-to-happen-say-scientists,The Guardian

Emergency services were called to Brunswick Street about 4.15pm this afternoon where the man was located with life threatening injuries.  Police believe he was involved in an altercation with a number of people at a car parked on Brunswick Street before he was fatally shot. Witnesses called triple zero and ambulance crews tried to treat the man, who is yet to be formally identified, but he later died at the scene.  Police have cordoned off the area and a crime scene has been established. Victoria police: The Victorian government has released more information on today’s Covid update. Health authorities say there’s been a 53% increase in the numbers of Victorians in hospital with the virus in the past two weeks, as BA.4/BA.5 becomes the dominant strain circulating in the community. At the same time, the third wave of Omicron isn’t expected to peak until August. The Victorian government joined  New South Wales  in reducing the period of reinfection from 12 weeks to 28 days, and has pushed for Victorians to get their booster and wear masks in high risk settings.

The payments for workers who needed to spend time away from work while they isolated ended on 30 June. But there have been calls for the payments to be reinstated as Covid case numbers and hospitalisations increase across the country, driven by new, infectious sub-variants. The prime minister, who today received his fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose, said he would not bring back the payments due to the need for the government to rein in spending. The new government had inherited the former’s decision to end the payments and $1tn of debt, he said: As case numbers rise across the country, the chief medical officer,  , said hospitals could hold back some elective surgery due to the strain on the system. He said the emergence of influenza for the first time in three years in Australia was making the situation worse. The health minister,  , said Covid cases were not likely to peak nationally for at least four weeks during the third wave of infections. While case numbers have increased and calls have grown for mask mandates to return, the prime minister said he would follow health advice on the issue. The epidemiologist  told Sky News educating the public about the risks of exposure to Covid would be more helpful than reintroducing a mask mandate. Australia has resisted calls from the Pacific for  no new gas or coal projects , saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions, in a move that could cause tensions as Pacific leaders meet in Suva this week.

Monkeypox patients advised to avoid contact with pets for three weeks,Nicola Davis,2022-05-27 18:10:00,"People with monkeypox have been told to avoid contact with their pets for three weeks amid concerns the animals could become infected and pass the virus on to other people. Monkeypox is caused by a viral infection  and can be found in animals including rodents and monkeys, as well as in humans. It is typically found in central and western Africa, however in recent weeks there has been a  surge in human cases  in countries where the disease is not endemic, including the UK. Now experts have advised people who have been diagnosed with monkeypox  to avoid contact with their pets  for three weeks. “Based on current evidence, for pet rodents in households where there are infected people, temporary removal from the household for a limited quarantine period (21 days) and testing to exclude infection is recommended, particularly where there are infected human contacts who have had close direct and prolonged contact with the animal or its bedding and/or litter,” guidance from a multi-agency group states. Other mammals kept as pets, such as cats and dogs, should be kept under household isolation with regular vet checks “to ensure no clinical signs are observed”. Wendi Shepherd, the monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in  England . As a precautionary measure our health protection teams are advising confirmed cases to avoid contact with any household pets for 21 days.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) added that if possible someone else in the household should care for the pet, including feeding and grooming it. But the UKHSA said if it was not possible to avoid contact with pets, people with monkeypox should minimise contact and wash their hands before and after. However the UKHSA and Defra have stressed the risk of someone passing monkeypox to their pet is low, with the latter noting there is evidence of risk for only a limited number of species, most of which are rodents. “No cases of monkeypox have ever been suspected or reported in pets in the UK and the risk remains low,” said the chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss. The move comes as the UKHSA announced a further 16 monkeypox cases had been identified in England, bringing the total to 101. To date three cases have been found in Scotland and one each in Wales and  Northern Ireland .",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/27/monkeypox-patients-contact-pets-uk,The Guardian
"Monkeypox outbreak could be just ‘the peak of the iceberg’, WHO warns",,2022-05-28 04:31:00,"The World  Health  Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief, acknowledged on Friday in a briefing to countries. Since the UK first reported a confirmed monkeypox case on 7 May, nearly 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency in countries far from the states where the virus is endemic. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has put the number of such cases at 219. Endemic in a number of west and central African nations, monkeypox cases have suddenly been detected in more than 20 other countries around the world, including the US, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and nearly a dozen EU countries. The Spanish health ministry said on Friday that 98 cases had been confirmed there so far, while the UK currently counts 90 verified infections. Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday, adding that all the occurrences are in men, mainly aged below 40. Argentina confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in Latin America on Friday. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva. “We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said, but stressed there was no need to panic. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” Monkeypox is related to smallpox, a deadly disease that was eradicated in 1980. But monkeypox is much less severe, with a fatality ratio of 3-6%. Most people recover within three to four weeks. The initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and chickenpox-like rash. There is not much in the way of treatment, but some antivirals developed against smallpox exist, including one that was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency against smallpox, Briand pointed out. Vaccines developed for smallpox have also been found to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. However, since smallpox has not posed a threat in more than four decades,  most people under the age of 45 have not received the vaccine , and the supplies of the jabs are today very limited. Briand said experts were trying to determine what had spurred this “unusual situation”, saying preliminary investigations did not seem to indicate that the virus that causes monkeypox had changed or mutated. She voiced hope that the spread could be halted. “We have a good window of opportunity to stop the transmission now,” she said. “If we put in place the right measures now, we probably can contain this easily.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/monkeypox-outbreak-could-be-just-the-peak-of-the-iceberg-who-warns,The Guardian
Further 71 cases of monkeypox detected in England,Harry Taylor,2022-05-30 19:03:00,"Another 71 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in England, according to the UK’s public health body. The UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) said the latest cases, as of 29 May, bring the total number in England to 172. Four cases have been detected in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales, taking the UK total to 179. Nearly 400 cases have been identified outside the virus’s usual areas of circulation, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  The updated case total comes after the UKHSA, along with authorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, issued joint guidance to stem the spread of the disease. It urged those with the virus to avoid close contact with others until their lesions have healed and any scabs have dried. They have also been told to avoid contact with pets  for three weeks . Anyone who has had contact with someone infected could be told to self-isolate for 21 days after a risk assessment. Updated guidance on Monday said that people who suspect they have the virus or have been diagnosed with it, and need to travel to get healthcare, should cover any lesions, wear a face mask and avoid public transport. They should also not have sex as soon as they notice the first symptoms, and use a condom for eight weeks after infection. Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to work closely with our colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure we are aligned in our approach to reducing the risk of transmission of monkeypox in the UK.” On Monday night, the WHO appeared to retreat on earlier comments where officials had said it could be the “peak of the iceberg”. Its top monkeypox expert, Dr Rosamund Lewis, said she did not think the virus would become globally prevalent: “At the moment, we are not concerned of a global pandemic.” The first cases in England were confirmed on 7 May. It is usually found in west and central Africa and can be transmitted through person-to-person close contact, including sex. A majority of cases identified so far are among men who have sex with men. Symptoms are normally mild and most recover within a few weeks. UKHSA has said that the risk to the UK population remains low, but people should be alert to any new rashes, spots, ulcers and blisters on their body. Anyone who has a rash with blisters should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre immediately, the agency added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/further-71-cases-of-monkeypox-detected-in-england,The Guardian
Why are monkeypox cases suddenly emerging across the world and could the virus have mutated?,Melissa Davey,2022-05-23 18:30:00,"The  sudden emergence of monkeypox in several countries  has raised questions about how the virus, which is most common in central and west Africa, has managed to spread. Many health experts have said the monkeypox cases in 12 countries are not cause for panic, given the virus is much less infectious than illnesses like Covid and rarely fatal, but it is highly unusual. First identified in 1970, monkeypox cases usually only occur outside central and west  Africa  when a traveller becomes infected there and subsequently returns home. These cases do not usually lead to wider outbreaks. In other rare cases, owners of imported pets become infected, with animals such as rodents believed to be sources of transmission. But the World  Health  Organization [WHO] said cases are rising in non-endemic countries, with no link to travel or animals identified in most of these cases.  So what are the main theories about why cases are suddenly emerging this time? Prof. Raina MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute,  told the Medical Journal of Australia  that “waning of immunity from smallpox vaccination may be contributing to the increasing outbreaks of monkeypox”. “It is more than  40-50 years since mass vaccination ceased ,” she said. The smallpox vaccine offered the bonus of strong protection against monkeypox. A  study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases  in February which warned monkeypox cases were rising also attributed this to the cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination, given that virus has been declared by WHO as eradicated. In some countries where the virus has been detected, like Australia, mass smallpox vaccination never occurred. Epidemiologists flagged growing case numbers before WHO issued its alert earlier in May. There were calls for better worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases prior to the current outbreaks because of data suggesting a resurgence of the disease. Between 2010 and 2019, cases re-emerged in Liberia and Sierra Leone after a four-decade absence and in Central African Republic after three decades,  research published in February and led by Pallas Health Research and Consultancy in The Netherlands found . Since the Covid-19 pandemic began researchers and health workers worldwide are also more alert to symptoms of viruses and are quicker to report anything unusual, helping to lead to the detection of cases. Human-to-human spread is not easy for monkeypox;  one study found 3% of close contacts of someone with monkeypox will become infected . But the strange rise in cases has raised the possibility that the virus may have mutated in a way that makes person-to-person transmission more likely. More data and laboratory analysis is needed to confirm this, however, and for now it is just a theory. Sequencing of the virus in laboratories is occurring, and we should know within days whether the virus has changed. While monkeypox has been around for decades it is nonetheless considered a rare disease, meaning there is always more to learn about it. When monkeypox does spread between humans, it is through close physical contact with someone who has symptoms.  Monkeypox  can lead to pus-filled lesions developing on the skin, and contact with fluid from this rash – including contact from contaminated clothing and bedding – can spread the virus. Sores in the mouth can also be infectious. In the current outbreak, clusters have occurred among men who have sex with men, which has not been the case previously. But experts have warned against declaring it a sexually transmitted disease, or attributing spread to certain communities. It is much more likely that the close contact that occurs during sex is responsible for spread, rather than the disease being sexually transmitted. In the meantime WHO has urged people not to stigmatise those diagnosed with the virus. “ We have seen messages stigmatising certain groups of people  around this outbreak of monkeypox,” WHO said in a statement. “We want to make it very clear that this is not right. First of all, anyone who has close physical contact of any kind with someone who has monkeypox is at risk, regardless of who they are, what they do, who they choose to have sex with or any other factor.” It could be that the virus has not mutated at all, but that it has taken advantage of an ideal opportunity to spread when all the conditions were right; for example, in a community of people in close contact with each other, where there were multiple opportunities for spread.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/why-are-monkeypox-cases-suddenly-emerging-across-the-world-and-could-the-virus-have-mutated,The Guardian
UK to announce more monkeypox cases as efforts ramp up to contain outbreak ,Ian Sample,2022-05-22 20:59:00,"Public health officials are to announce more UK  monkeypox  cases on Monday, as efforts ramp up to contain the first multinational outbreak of the virus that has led to cases in at least 14 countries. The unusual outbreak of the rare disease has sparked a wave of contact tracing and testing, with the closest contacts of confirmed cases – such as partners and people in the same household – offered a vaccine and told to isolate at home for up to 21 days. Under UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) guidance, the same high-risk contacts are advised to avoid immunosuppressed people, pregnant women and children under 12, as they are more vulnerable to serious infections. Reports have said that one of the UK cases is a child who is in intensive care in London with the disease. The NHS and UKHSA said they would not discuss individual cases. While some monkeypox patients have been admitted to hospital, many confirmed cases that do not need specialist care are told to isolate at home until local health protection teams are confident they are no longer infectious. “The vast majority of identified cases are isolating at home and do not require hospital admission,” said Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. Monkeypox does not spread easily, and most people who become infected develop only mild symptoms, including fever, rash and blisters, which can clear up without treatment. But the virus can cause more serious illness in those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UKHSA, said further cases identified over the weekend would be confirmed on Monday. Since the first was announced in the UK on 7 May – a person who arrived in London from  Nigeria  – the agency has confirmed 19 more cases, the majority among young men who have sex with men. The outbreak is unusual because although the UK has had sporadic cases of monkeypox before – seven from 2018 to 2021 – all previous cases were linked to travel from Nigeria. Most of the latest cases in the UK and beyond have no known links to parts of west or central  Africa  where the virus is endemic. Globally, more than 180 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries. More than half are in Spain and  Portugal . Genetic analysis of three monkeypox viruses from the outbreak have found it closely matches the virus that spread from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019. The same studies suggest that a Belgian man contracted the virus on a recent trip to Portugal. The pattern of the outbreak suggests the virus is spreading primarily through sexual networks. The infection can be passed on through close contact with body fluids, infected ulcers, and contaminated material such as towels and bedding. Superspreader events may have boosted the outbreak since it arrived in  Europe . “I think it’s possible that some of these outbreaks will be driven by superspreading events,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University. “For example, the Spanish health authorities are looking at a sauna as a site of single exposure that resulted in many secondary cases. The reportedly mild presentations of several cases may also be a factor, in that people will be more mobile and potentially likely to socialise. However, we do still need to understand more about the transmission dynamics.” Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning show that community transmission in the UK was “largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men”. Asked why cases were mostly in that group, she said: “That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have. “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department. We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country. “We would recommend to anyone who’s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash.” Dewsnap said sexual health clinics were already under massive pressures because of cuts and lack of support in recent years, while there were a “worrying number of unfilled genitourinary medicine specialist posts in sexual health clinics.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/monkeypox-uk-health-security-agency-to-announce-more-cases,The Guardian

UN denounces ‘homophobic and racist’ reporting on monkeypox spread,,2022-05-23 02:34:00,"The United Nations’ Aids agency has called some reporting on the monkeypox virus racist and homophobic, warning of exacerbating stigma and undermining the response to the growing outbreak. UNAIDS said “a significant proportion” of recent monkeypox cases have been identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. But transmission was most likely via close physical contact with a monkeypox sufferer and could affect anyone, it added, saying some portrayals of Africans and LGBTI people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”. As of 21 May, the World  Health  Organization received reports of 92 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox cases and 28 suspected cases from 12 countries where the disease is not endemic, including several European nations, the US, Australia and Canada. “Stigma and blame undermine trust and capacity to respond effectively during outbreaks like this one,” said the UNAIDS deputy executive director, Matthew Kavanagh. “Experience shows that stigmatising rhetoric can quickly disable evidence-based response by stoking cycles of fear, driving people away from health services, impeding efforts to identify cases and encouraging ineffective, punitive measures.” Argentina’s health ministry said on Sunday it had detected a suspected case of monkeypox in Buenos Aires, amid growing global alarm over rising cases in  Europe  and elsewhere of the viral infection more common to west and central Africa. Israel and Switzerland both said they identified one infected person who had recently travelled abroad. Israel is investigating other suspected cases. Austria confirmed its first case of the virus on Sunday, while in the US health authorities said they might have found the country’s third case and were running tests on a patient in South Florida. Monkeypox symptoms include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face. No treatment exists, but the symptoms usually clear up after two to four weeks.

Monkeypox cases confirmed in Wales and Northern Ireland,Nicola Davis,2022-05-26 15:07:00,"Cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in Wales and  Northern Ireland , public health officials have announced, as experts stress the risk to the general public remains low. Public  Health  Wales, which has confirmed one case, urged people to be aware of the symptoms of the virus, adding it was important for gay and bisexual men to be alert. The majority of monkeypox cases recently diagnosed in England have been found among men who identify as gay, bisexual and among men who have sex with men.  The director of health protection at Public Health  Wales , Dr Giri Shankar, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed.” He added: “We are reassuring people that monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the general public is low. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.” On Thursday, a case of monkeypox was also confirmed in Northern Ireland. “This was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases elsewhere in the UK,”  the Public Health Agency (PHA) of Northern Ireland said in a statement . The UKHSA announced on Thursday that a further eight cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in England, bringing the total to 85. Three cases have also been identified to date in Scotland. The UKHSA has revealed that a vaccine against smallpox – a related but more serious disease that has been globally eradicated – is being offered to close contacts of people who have been diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. “Previous data from Africa suggests that  previous vaccines against smallpox may be up to 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection ,” a document released by the agency reveals. The rising number of cases of monkeypox in multiple countries around the world is unusual: while cases have cropped up in countries including the UK in the past, these have typically been in people who have returned from countries in central or western Africa, where the virus is endemic. Among the hypotheses experts have suggested to explain the surge is that the virus  may have been circulating  at low levels in the UK for several years before it took off. Experts have also noted the outbreak  may have been made more likely given most countries ended their smallpox vaccination programmes in the 1970s, and the vaccine also offers protection against monkeypox.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/wales-announces-discovery-of-its-first-monkeypox-case,The Guardian
Tuesday briefing: Everything you need to know about monkeypox,Nimo Omer,2022-05-24 06:56:00,"Good morning. As the seemingly  never-ending fiasco of Partygate rumbles on  (new pictures, that were obtained by ITV News, appear to show the prime minister drinking with colleagues during the coronavirus lockdown in November 2020) another virus has begun worrying scientists. Understandably, after two years of a pandemic, any mention of a new viral outbreak is going to be quite alarming. So it’s no surprise that when countries across Europe and North America started  detecting cases of monkeypox , a disease usually found in central and western Africa, there was a bit of a panic. So far,  over 100 confirmed cases  have been identified in 16 countries. It feels eerily similar to reports of a mystery disease found in Wuhan in 2019 – but is it? I spoke to the Guardian’s science editor, Ian Sample, about how concerned we should really be. First though, the headlines: toasting a senior aide Foreign Office official witnessed her strike for 24 hours  life in prison A damning parliamentary report 57 cases of monkeypox  have been detected in the UK, with  Scotland announcing its first case yesterday , and that number will continue to grow. But before you start to worry about lockdowns and another deadly pandemic, below we have outlined some fairly reassuring facts about this newly-famous virus. Monkeypox has been around for a while. It’s a zoonotic virus (meaning it travels from animals to humans) and was first discovered in 1958 in colonies of monkeys. The first human case was recorded about 12 years later in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and for the last few decades the virus has generally stayed around central and west Africa, particularly in close proximity to tropical rainforests. Melissa Davey, Guardian Australia’s medical editor, has written  a great explainer  on the various reasons that cases of the virus are suddenly rising now. The virus has two genetic strains: the central African strain and the west African strain. The former is known to spread more easily and cause more severe symptoms whereas, generally speaking, the latter is milder – and it is that west African strain that is being found at the moment. “As far as I’m aware, no one outside Africa has died of monkeypox,” our science editor Ian Sample tells me. “Most people just shrug it off after a few weeks.” Ian’s right, according to the  World Health Organisation  there have been no fatalities associated with this outbreak.  Monkeypox has also been detected in the UK before, Ian says. “These cases caused doctors to scratch their heads in sexual health clinics. You had people turning up with ulcers and spots on their face and genitals, but they weren’t testing positive for the usual suspects like herpes.” But usually such patients have been quickly linked to somebody travelling to a country with high levels of monkeypox and bringing it back with them. Now – for the first time – the virus is being detected in people that have not travelled to western or central Africa. Scientists are left trying to figure out how these people were infected. Monkeypox is spread when there is close contact with an infected person or animal. “This virus isn’t airborne [like coronavirus],” Ian explains, “it gets into someone’s body through broken skin. Even if you can’t see those breakages the virus can get through.” This is perhaps why a lot of cases are found to have been sexually transmitted, but that’s not the only way it can happen. It is possible to catch it the way you would any other virus, like the flu, through your nose or mouth, if someone infected sneezed into your face, or coughed right at you, “but they’d have to be pretty close,” Ian adds. “And there’s also a possibility of getting it if you’re changing the bedding of a patient who’s had a lot of these ulcers which can have quite high concentrations of the virus in them.” But crucially there does have to be a high level of close contact. There’s no need to sound the alarm just yet. Monkeypox is not like Covid-19 – it’s nowhere near as transmissible, meaning that large outbreaks are very unlikely, and as it’s the milder strain of monkeypox, there’s not much to worry about in terms of death rates or severe disease either. “Monkeypox is a DNA virus, it doesn’t evolve anywhere near as fast as the RNA viruses, which is what coronavirus is,” Ian says. And because the virus is not new, doctors do have solutions on hand to mitigate damage: “the smallpox vaccine can give you about 85% protection against monkeypox. And there are also a couple of antivirals that could help.” That doesn’t mean monitoring isn’t needed. It’s still important we know who has got it and try to prevent the spread, as it can be dangerous for children, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems – hence why those testing positive are asked to isolate for three weeks. And the symptoms can be debilitating: headaches, nausea, fever, swelling lymph nodes, exhaustion and lesions that turn into ulcers on the face, hands and feet. But it’s not just those who have caught the disease that are suffering as a result of the outbreak. The UN has condemned what it has described as  racist and homophobic reporting of monkeypox . A significant proportion of these cases have been detected in men who have sex with men, but scientists are clear that this does not mean that only LGBT+ people can catch the disease. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infected is likely to get infected themselves. But the sinister undertone of some reporting is reminiscent of other viral infections that have been used to further stigmatise gay men in the past. “​​We saw this in the 1980s with HIV,” says Ian. “At times it was referred to as a ‘gay disease’ and that is obviously nonsense – anyone can get HIV just like anyone can get monkeypox.” Unlike Covid-19, monkeypox has been around for decades and been thoroughly studied. We know it doesn’t spread easily, it’s outside its natural home in the tropical rainforests, and it’s almost impossible to not know you have it once symptoms begin, making contact tracing and isolation easier. Cases will inevitably increase but unless something changes, it shouldn’t have the same catastrophic impact as the last disease to dominate the headlines.

Monkeypox cases put UK's tropical disease response to the test,Nazia Parveen,2018-10-07 14:48:00,"The man had contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), the first such diagnosis in the UK since 2013. Beadsworth said his chances of survival were slim. Of the previous four cases, three had died. After weeks of painstaking, meticulous care in the world-renowned tropical diseases unit, however, the man survived. For Beadsworth, 50, and his team, there would be little respite. He was driving home when he received a phone call. A person in the UK  had contracted monkeypox for the first time . The airborne disease was diagnosed in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall. “We were literally stepping down the unit after looking after the Mers case. This guy had survived and we were really pleased for him,” he said. “But then I got a call to say we would have to reactivate the network because of a probable monkeypox case in Cornwall. My first thought was: ‘You’ve got to be joking.’ We had just had a pretty hellish couple of weeks and now we had this.” Following the  Ebola  crisis of 2014, when the West African epidemic was declared an international emergency, Beadsworth and other health professionals came up with a contingency plan if a deadly infectious disease were to enter the UK. Now this plan from the High Consequence Infectious Diseases Network – comprising five NHS trusts – was being tested in reality. Infectious disease experts took part in a teleconference call and plans to contain monkeypox were discussed. “The call lasted around 30 minutes. It was a business call and quick decisions were made,” Beadsworth said. “Although we regard ourselves as specialists in tropical medicine, no one here had seen a case in the UK. There was a lot of rapid literature reading that night.” The patient was sent to the Royal Free hospital in London, one of five centres in the UK able to care for patients with highly infectious diseases. Beadsworth was relieved. The emergency action plan had worked, the patient had been isolated and the risk had seemingly been contained. Four days later, however, the “most unimaginable” thing happened. A  second, unrelated case of monkeypox was diagnosed  in Blackpool. The patient had also just returned to the UK from Nigeria. “It was fairly unimaginable to have a Mers case, and then it was unimaginable to have one case of monkeypox in Cornwall. Then to have a second one, it really was like lightning striking twice,” he said. The patient was taken to the Blackpool Victoria hospital before being transferred to Liverpool.  Consultants, registrars and nurses undertook a process called “donning and doffing” to minimise the risk of spreading the disease and catching it themselves. It included wearing extra protective clothing, fitted masks, goggles, and three pairs of gloves. After each contact with the patient all their clothing was incinerated. Beadsworth said: “The patients tend to be very scared because they have suddenly been moved and they have got all these individuals wearing these space suits and they can’t see faces. But you can’t breach, you can’t make a mistake.” The rare viral infection, normally confined to African states, was first discovered in monkeys in 1958. It is similar to smallpox, but not as deadly. The first case in a human was identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, and cases have since been reported in other central and west African countries. On 26 September  a third case of monkeypox was diagnosed in the UK  in a female healthcare worker briefly involved in the treatment of the second patient at Blackpool Victoria hospital. The 40-year-old healthcare assistant from Fleetwood is now being looked after in the specialist unit at Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. It is understood that the woman’s colleagues at Blackpool Victoria and patients at her GP surgery have been offered the smallpox vaccine, which protects against the monkeypox virus. On Wednesday the Blackpool Gazette reported that residents in Fleetwood were alarmed by the sight of paramedics in white overalls and face masks at a house. A woman was taken to hospital but tests have since confirmed she had not contracted the disease. Public  Health  England, the government agency leading the effort to contain the UK outbreak, confirmed it was linked to the monitoring of monkeypox. For Beadsworth it has been challenging but also fascinating to deal with monkeypox in the UK. Samples taken from the UK patients and sent to the to the rare and imported pathogens laboratory near Salisbury will now help to develop vaccines. “It has been incredibly rewarding because this is what we have set this unit up for,” he said. “But the single most important thing that has come out of this is that the network that was set up after Ebola has worked. It may not appear like that to the public at the moment, but behind the scenes it has worked really, really well.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/07/monkeypox-cases-put-uks-tropical-disease-response-to-the-test,The Guardian
Monkeypox cases in UK more than double to 57,Ian Sample,2022-05-23 17:50:00,"Public health officials have confirmed 36 new cases of monkeypox in England, bringing to 57 the total number of known infections in the UK. Efforts to contain the outbreak are continuing, with patients isolated either in hospital or at home and their closest contacts being told to isolate and avoid contact with vulnerable people such as young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems, for up to three weeks. The most at-risk contacts have been offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, which offers cross-protection against monkeypox, a far milder disease, and can be effective up to two weeks after exposure to the virus. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK  Health  Security Agency, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK. Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact-tracing efforts, you are helping us limit the spread of this infection.” Austria, Switzerland and Israel became the latest nations to declare cases. At least 15 countries outside Africa have now detected the disease, totalling about 100 cases. Earlier on Monday,  Scotland  confirmed its first patient, who is isolating in hospital. Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland, said the overall risk to the public was low but he urged anyone with an unusual blister-like rash or blister-like sores on their body to avoid close contact with others and seek medical advice if worried. “We have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with such cases of infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed,” he said. “We are working with NHS Boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.” Boris Johnson, when asked about the outbreak during a visit to a school in south-east London, said monkeypox was a rare disease, but it was important to “keep an eye on it” given the unprecedented outbreak. “So far the consequences don’t seem to be very serious, but it’s important that we keep an eye on it, and that’s exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing,” he said. Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or use of the smallpox vaccine, Johnson said: “As things stand, the judgment is that it’s rare. I think we’re looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. It hasn’t yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.” Monkeypox does not spread easily and is a mild disease in most people, but it can cause more serious illness in young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Phin said more vaccine doses and antivirals for monkeypox had been ordered. The UKHSA announced the first case in the latest outbreak  on 7 May , in a person who had returned to London from Nigeria, but some cases identified since seem to have been infected earlier and the majority have no travel history to Africa. The outbreak appears to be driven by the milder, west African type of monkeypox, which has a case fatality rate of about 1%, compared with 10% for the more severe central or Congo Basin type. People who are infected with monkeypox typically develop a high temperature or fever before small, flat spots appear on their skin. These become raised and filled with fluid before scabbing over. The spots can start around the mouth and spread around the body, including to the genitals. The virus can spread through large respiratory droplets, direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, or blisters and ulcers, and through contaminated sheets, towels and utensils. “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms,” Hopkins said. “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service. Monkeypox is a viral infection most commonly found in animals in rural central and west Africa. In recent years countries such as Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have witnessed more cases in humans, with the virus spreading between people. A small number of cases have been detected in the UK since 2018, but until this year all were associated with travel to Nigeria. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s lead on emerging diseases, said there would be more cases in the coming days, but the virus could be stopped. “This is a containable situation, particularly in the countries where we are seeing these outbreaks that are happening across Europe, in North America as well. We can stop human-to-human transmission,” she said. ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/scotland-reports-first-monkeypox-case,The Guardian
"Four new cases of monkeypox identified in the UK, bringing total to seven",,2022-05-16 19:33:00,"Four more cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases of the disease to seven, health bosses have said. Three of the cases were detected in London, and one in the north-east of England, the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) announced on Monday. It is working to find links between the latest four cases, which all appear to have been contracted in the capital. Common contacts have been established between two of the four people who have caught the virus. Those needing care are being treated in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal free hospital and Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London, and the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. The cases do not, however, seem to be connected to the previous confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK  announced on 14 May , nor the  first UK case announced on 7 May , which has led to concerns that there has been community transmission of the virus. The first case was a person who had recently travelled to  Nigeria , which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection before travelling to the UK. UKHSA added that all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual. The health body is therefore asking these groups “to be alert” to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Due to the recent rise in case numbers and uncertainties about how the infections were transmitted, UKHSA has said it is working closely with NHS partners to establish whether there have been any more cases in recent weeks, and with international partners to examine whether other countries have seen a similar rise in monkeypox. The health agency emphasises that the virus does not spread easily between people and that the risk to the UK population is low. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” The rash, which can develop as part of the virus, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The health agency also said that initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/four-new-cases-of-monkeypox-identified-in-the-uk-bringing-total-to-seven,The Guardian
US monitoring over 200 people for potential monkeypox exposure,Maya Yang,2021-07-26 16:20:00,"US health officials are monitoring more than 200 people for potential exposure to monkeypox, after an individual who contracted the disease in Nigeria returned to  Texas  in July. Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus similar to smallpox. According to the   federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), it was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, chills, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that often begins on the face and spreads to the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The CDC said it was  working  with airline, state and local health authorities in 27 states to identify and assess individuals who may have been in contact with the person on flights from Lagos to Atlanta and Atlanta to Dallas on 9 July. The individual went to the emergency room at a Dallas hospital and was diagnosed with monkeypox on 15 July,  Stat News  reported. People being monitored include those who sat within 6ft of the infected individual on flight from Lagos, those who used the flight’s bathroom, flight attendants, airline workers who cleaned the bathroom and family members who came in contact with the individual in  Dallas . The CDC  said  the infection rate for the monkeypox strain concerned was one in 100 people. “It’s believed the risk of spread of monkeypox on the plane and in the airports is low, as travelers were required to wear masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic and monkeypox is primarily spread through respiratory droplets,” it said. The Dallas county judge, Clay Jenkins,  said : “While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public. Dallas county health and human services is working closely with local providers, as well as our state and federal partners.” The incubation period for monkeypox ranges from three to 17 days, similar to the two- to 14-day period for Sars-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the CDC has asked health authorities to monitor the individuals for 21 days, ending on 30 July. “We’re in the time frame where we certainly want to closely monitor people,”  said  Andrea McCollum, who leads the poxvirus epidemiology unit at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. “It is a lot of people,” she said. The last detection of monkeypox in the US was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states. The outbreak occurred after a shipment from Ghana to Texas contained rodents and small mammals that had the virus. Nigeria has seen a rise in monkeypox cases and seven exported cases have been  detected:  four in the UK and others in Israel, Singapore and the US.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/26/us-monkeypox-exposure-health-officials,The Guardian

Here’s a summary of the main developments: Island  detected in two New South Wales residents Australian passport office buckles reunited with their lost cat party as the Murugappan family returns home Have a great evening and pleasant weekend. There has been a fourth, and probably fifth, case of monkeypox detected in two  New South Wales  residents who recently returned from Europe. According to NSW  Health , the two men in their 30s, who were travelling companions, developed mild illnesses several days after arriving back in Sydney. Both men presented to a doctor with symptoms clinically compatible with monkeypox.  Urgent testing results for one of the men is consistent with monkeypox, making it the fourth case in NSW. His companion is likely to be confirmed as the fifth case.  Both men are isolating at home. As Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths remain high across Australia, Victoria is scaling back its dedicated pandemic response workforce, reports  .

Led by   until he stepped down at the end of April, the central bureaucracy has overseen the state’s test, trace and isolation system since it was set up in 2020. The state government believes the time is right for the shake-up, with 70% of all Covid-19 vaccinations currently delivered by local GPs and pharmacists and more people opting to use rapid antigen tests. Under the changes, local public health units will lead the delivery of Covid-19 services under the health department’s stewardship. “The Covid-19 Response was always a time-limited operation,” a Victorian government spokesman said on Saturday. Victorian health minister  has acknowledged the state is facing a “challenging winter” as bubbling Covid-19 cases and the return of flu place further pressure on the system. While Australia’s Covid-19 intensive care figures have fallen in the past fortnight, about 2,700 patients remain in hospitals across the country. More than 28,000 new Covid-19 cases were reported in Australia on Saturday, along with a further 60 deaths to take the weekly toll to 292.

North Korea reported some 79,100 more people with fever symptoms and one additional death amid its first-confirmed coronavirus outbreak,   reports, citing state media KCNA. The reclusive country has been waging a battle against an unprecedented Covid-19 wave since declaring a state of emergency and imposing a nationwide lockdown last month, fuelling concerns over a lack of vaccines and medical and food supplies. The total number of fever patients compiled across the country since late April neared 4 million, and the death toll rose by one to 71, KCNA said, using data from the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters. KCNA has said the epidemic has shown signs subsiding, after daily tallies of fever cases topped 390,000 two weeks ago. North Korea has never confirmed how many people have tested positive for Covid-19, apparently lacking testing supplies.

"More monkeypox cases detected in UK ‘on daily basis’, says scientist",Ian Sample,2022-05-22 14:40:00,"More monkeypox cases are being detected in Britain “on a daily basis”, a senior doctor has warned, amid reports that a child has been admitted to intensive care with the disease. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser to the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), said an update on confirmed cases would be released on Monday as efforts continue to contain the outbreak using contact tracing, testing and vaccination. The number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 20 on Friday and is expected to climb significantly in the weeks ahead as more people are traced and others come forward for testing. Public health officials are still working to identify the source of the outbreak as many of the patients have no known links to other cases. Monkeypox is a mild disease in most people and resolves without treatment in two to four weeks. But it can be more dangerous in vulnerable people, such as those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children. According to the  Sunday Telegraph , the UK cases include a child who is being treated in intensive care in a London hospital. The UKHSA said it did not confirm or discuss information at patient level. The agency confirmed the first case of monkeypox on 7 May, three days after a passenger with symptoms returned to London from Nigeria, a country that has had a large number of cases since 2017. Sexual health clinics have since reported a flurry of cases among men who have sex with men, some of whom developed symptoms weeks earlier. More than 180 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries. More than half are in Spain and Portugal. “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department,” Dr Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning. Asked if the virus was spreading in the community in the UK, she said: “Absolutely. We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country.” Monkeypox was first discovered in monkeys used for research in 1958, but the natural reservoir for the disease is believed to be rodents. The virus is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. Until this year, only seven cases had been detected in the UK, in 2018, 2019 and 2021, and all were linked with travel to Nigeria. “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men,” Hopkins said. Asked why cases were mostly in that group, she said: “That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have.” “We would recommend to anyone who’s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash” she added. Monkeypox is not a highly infectious disease and most cases in rural Africa are believed to arise when people come into contact with infected animals. But the disease can spread from person to person through close contact with ulcers and blisters, which often appear around the mouth and genitals; respiratory droplets; and contaminated materials such as bedding, towels and cooking utensils. The incubation period can be as long as 21 days, meaning symptoms can take three weeks to appear after exposure to the virus, but in the latest outbreak, many patients are developing a rash within days. Patients can develop a fever before other symptoms come on. To help contain the spread of the virus, high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, including some healthcare workers, have been given shots of a smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, which can protect against monkeypox. “We’re using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms,” Hopkins said.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/22/more-monkeypox-cases-detected-in-uk-on-daily-basis-says-scientist,The Guardian
First case of monkeypox confirmed in Ireland,,2022-05-28 12:36:00,"The first confirmed case of  monkeypox  in Ireland has been identified, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said. The infection was reported in the east of the country on Friday night and the person affected was not kept in hospital. A further suspected case is also being investigated and test results are being awaited, health officials said. A public health risk assessment has been carried out and those who have been in contact with the person are being advised on what to do in the event that they become ill. A statement from HSE said: “The Health Protection Surveillance Centre was notified last night of a confirmed case of monkeypox in  Ireland , in the east of the country. “This person has not been hospitalised. This was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases in the UK and many European countries. “Public health is following up those who had close contact with the person with monkeypox while they were infectious. In order to maintain patient confidentiality, no further information about this person will be provided. “A suspected case is also being investigated and test results are awaited. A public health risk assessment has been undertaken and those who were in contact with the person are being advised on what to do in the event that they become ill.” The UK Health Security Agency on Friday announced a further 16 monkeypox cases had been identified in England, bringing the total to 101.

US reports rare case of monkeypox amid small outbreaks in Europe,,2022-05-19 02:19:00,"Massachusetts officials on Wednesday reported a rare case of monkeypox in a man who recently traveled to Canada, and health officials are looking into whether it is connected to small outbreaks in Europe. Monkeypox is typically limited to Africa, and rare cases in the US and elsewhere are usually linked to travel there. A small number of confirmed or suspected cases have been reported this month in the  United Kingdom , Portugal and  Spain . Health officials in the US said they are in contact with officials in the UK and Canada as part of the investigation. But “at this point in time, we don’t have any information that links the Massachusetts case to cases in the UK,” said Jennifer McQuiston of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though it is the only US case the CDC is aware of, “I do think we are preparing for the possibility of more cases,” she said. The US case poses no risk to the public, and the Massachusetts resident is hospitalized but in good condition, officials said. The man traveled to Canada at the end of April to meet friends and returned in early May, McQuiston said. A CDC statement said he used private transportation. The case is the first in the US this year. Last year, Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who traveled to Nigeria. Monkeypox typically begins with a flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes, followed by a rash on the face and body. In Africa, people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, and it does not usually spread easily among people. However, investigators in Europe say most of the cases have been in gay or bisexual men, and officials are looking into the possibility that some infections were spread through close contact during sex. Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox.  It is usually mild, although there are two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe – with up to 10% mortality – and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate of more like 1% of cases.

"We will see more cases of monkeypox, warn British scientists",Robin McKie,2022-05-21 23:04:00,"Scientists have warned that they expect monkeypox cases  to continue to rise  this week as more infected people are traced by health authorities. More than 90 cases have already been reported in Europe, the US and Australia, including 20 in Britain.  The World Health Organization said there were a further 28 suspected cases, in addition to the 92 confirmed in 12 member states which were not endemic for the virus. The global figure is unprecedented for a disease that is normally confined to central and west Africa. Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, so doctors have been puzzled by the outbreak and by the appearance of cases on different continents at the same time. The virus is only transmitted from person to person through close physical contact –  including sexual intercourse . Symptoms are usually mild – headaches, aching muscles and exhaustion – but monkeypox also causes skin lesions which can become infected, resulting in secondary infections. “I am certain that we are going to see more cases,” said Charlotte Hammer, a Cambridge University expert on emerging diseases. “First, health authorities are now – very actively – looking for cases, so we are more likely to spot people with mild versions which we might previously have missed or misdiagnosed. “In addition, monkeypox has an incubation period of between one and three weeks so it is likely we will see new infections among those who were in early contact with the outbreak’s first cases.” Monkeypox has been found outside Africa in the past, but the number and range of cases in the present outbreak is unusual. “Essentially, we face two options,” Hammer said. “Either the virus is inherently different now or perhaps our susceptibility to it has changed. Alternatively, it could just be that we have an encountered a perfect storm of conditions that have allowed the virus to spread this way. I think the latter scenario is the more likely one.” One possibility is that the effects of past mass  smallpox vaccinations  is fading, leaving fewer people with protection against the closely related monkeypox. However, Prof Keith Neal, of Nottingham University, added: “Has the virus changed? Well it does not actually appear to be any more lethal, though something may have affected its transmissibility. And don’t forget this is a DNA virus and is unlikely to mutate at the rates that RNA viruses do, including those that cause Covid or HIV. Overall, I am not too worried.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/we-will-see-more-cases-of-monkeypox-warn-british-scientists,The Guardian
Person diagnosed with monkeypox in England after visiting Nigeria,Sarah Boseley,2019-12-04 12:26:00,"A person is being treated for monkeypox in England, a rare viral infection similar to the eradicated disease smallpox, public health authorities have confirmed. Public  Health  England (PHE) says monkeypox is not very transmissible and the patient is not thought to pose a risk to other people. He or she – their identity has not been revealed – is thought to have contracted it during a visit to Nigeria. PHE is getting in touch with people who may have been in contact with the patient as a precautionary measure, including those who travelled to the UK on the same flight. It says they will be given appropriate advice and be monitored if necessary. “Monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low. We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary,” said Dr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at PHE. “PHE and the  NHS  have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission,” she said. The individual was in south-west England when they fell ill and was transferred to the high consequence infectious disease centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London. There were  three cases of monkeypox in the UK  in September last year. The first was a resident of Nigeria who was staying at a naval base in Cornwall. There was no link to the second case, it was said at the time, even though that person had also spent time in Nigeria. The third was a healthcare worker involved in the care of one of the patients at Blackpool Victoria hospital before the infection was identified. Last year PHE said there had been a sustained outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and that it was expected the virus would continue to circulate there. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease which does not easily spread between humans and is usually self-limiting, meaning people recover within a few weeks. Sometimes, however, they become severely ill and it can be fatal in up to 10% of cases. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/04/person-diagnosed-with-monkeypox-in-england-after-visiting-nigeria,The Guardian
Africa’s health boss seeks to tempt expat medics to come back home,James Tapper,2022-01-23 08:45:00,"During the pandemic, the UK and other rich nations have relied on African doctors and nurses to shore up their health services. Now the continent’s chief health leader is hoping to put the brain drain into reverse with a plan to persuade African expats to return. Dr John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said they were planning a programme to attract scientists, doctors and nurses back from the diaspora. “The leadership of the continent must invest in strengthening health systems,” Nkengasong said, in an interview with the  . “We need a very deliberate programme that facilitates Africans in the diaspora to come back to the continent and do a rotation. A Ghanaian or Nigerian in London doesn’t just wake up in the morning and think, ‘I’m going to go to Nigeria for a year.’ That person needs lodging, basic transportation. They have responsibilities, a job.” He said the Africa CDC would soon put forward a package of measures to the African Union commission to create a regional health treaty to govern the pandemic response, which would include support for expatriates. Research by the House of Commons library last year showed that 2.5% of  NHS  England’s 1.35 million staff were African. The largest proportion were the 10,494 from Nigeria, with a further 4,780 from Zimbabwe, 3,395 from Ghana and 2,895 from Egypt. Nigeria has about 72,000 registered doctors, but only 35,000 were practising in the country in 2021, according to Abba Moro, a Nigerian senator. The Africa CDC set up seven working groups allowing doctors and scientists working in richer countries to give regular advice remotely. “They have been extremely useful during this pandemic,” Nkengasong said. “We need to formalise it and facilitate the return to the continent to support the public need.” Africa seems to have  suffered less severely from Covid  and its variants than other continents. About 10 million people are estimated to have been infected but that is probably an undercounting, Dr Nkengasong said, and about 220,000 people have died. “That’s relatively low for a continent of 1.3 billion,” he said. “We saw  India was overwhelmed by Covid  in May, you couldn’t hide it. We’ve not seen a scenario in Africa where people are dying on the streets. “I think there is a puzzle of why many more people have been infected in Africa, but it has not translated into many deaths. That is a research question we need to investigate, and also how many deaths we are missing. “We have to be prepared for variants to emerge that will be more challenging than what we are dealing with.” Africa CDC has been instrumental in creating the Sentinel network of labs to track the virus using genomic sequencing that led to the detection of the Omicron variant in Botswana in November. “We have the infrastructure in place to detect early, prevent and respond,” he said. “Take west Africa – there’s a lot of public health assets there. The Noguchi [Medical Research] Institute in Nigeria is a state-of-the-art facility. The Pasteur Institute in Cote d’Ivoire, the Pasteur Institute in Senegal, the Medical Research Council in the Gambia – but they were not talking to each other. The whole concept of this new public health order is to use as much in the region as you can.” He added that in 2018 he was contacted by public health officials in Sierra Leone about a suspected monkeypox case, asking for help to find someone at the US CDC to test for the disease. “I said no, if you send that to Cote d’Ivoire, I know they have the primers to help you do that.” That mindset of Africans always needing help from richer western nations is far too widespread, he said. “People see the continent as a place to go, do a few projects, gather the data, publish it, do a few clinical trials and get out. That is not global health. It should be an equal partnership, recognising that the principal investigators should come from the developing countries.” The pandemic provided an example of the limits of western help, he said, with the WHO’s  Covax  programme. The Gavi alliance, which directs the programme, had pledged 2bn doses of vaccines to 144 poorer countries in 2021, but managed about 900m. Earlier this month, poorer nations rejected 100m doses that were close to expiring. There have been heated debates about whether western countries were hoarding vaccines. “Covax represents the best mechanisms of global cooperation,” Nkengasong said. “But look at what happened. It’s a good example of where good intention is not matched by reality. The promissory note that African countries would get vaccines at the same time didn’t happen. “And what we did, under the leadership of President Ramaphosa, we established the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team and we were able to acquire 400m doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.” So far Africa CDC has launched 12 pandemic initiatives, he said. As well as genomic surveillance and vaccines, there are plans to secure diagnostics and testing kits, and medical supplies.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/africas-health-boss-seeks-to-tempt-expat-medics-to-come-back-home,The Guardian
Medic becomes third person infected with monkeypox in England,Damien Gayle,2018-09-26 13:42:00,"A medical worker has become the third person diagnosed with monkeypox in England, less than a month after the infection first appeared in the country. The person had cared for a patient at Blackpool Victoria hospital who was subsequently diagnosed with monkeypox, according to Public  Health  England (PHE). It is thought to be the first case of the virus spreading within the UK. All three infected patients are being treated in isolation units in different regions. It is thought the virus passed to the latest patient from an individual who contracted it after travelling to Nigeria, where an outbreak began 12 months ago. That patient – the  second recorded case  in the UK – was diagnosed days after a resident of Nigeria staying at a naval base in Cornwall  presented with symptoms . PHE said there was no UK link between the first two patients. The first patient is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London, the second is at the Royal Liverpool University hospital, and the latest is at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Monkeypox is caused by a virus that enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion before a rash develops, usually beginning on the face and spreading to other parts of the body. The rash goes through different stages before finally forming a scab that later falls off. Most people recover within several weeks and suffer no long-term effects, according to PHE. The first case of monkeypox outside of Africa  was recorded in 2003 . The virus, which comes from the same family as smallpox and cowpox, was first identified in a captive monkey about four decades ago and has subsequently been found in a range of animals in central and west Africa, particularly rodents. People living in rural areas of west Africa are regularly exposed to the virus and infections are common. A large and sustained outbreak of monkeypox began in Nigeria in September 2017, and since then sporadic cases have been reported. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for monkeypox, according to  the World Health Organization . Most people vaccinated for smallpox will be protected, but smallpox vaccines are not generally available since its global eradication. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the national infection service at PHE, said the latest case was “not wholly unexpected” and that the agency was tracing all potential contacts. “This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made,” he said. “We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly.” PHE previously said it was also trying to contact passengers who were near the first patient on the flight to the UK. It said people who had no symptoms were not considered to be infectious and anyone who was not contacted did not need to take any action.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/26/medic-becomes-third-person-infected-with-monkeypox-in-england,The Guardian
Australia’s first cases of monkeypox virus identified in NSW and Victoria ,,2022-05-20 05:31:00,"Two cases of monkeypox virus have been confirmed in Australia with one in  New South Wales  and another in Victoria. The NSW case was a man in his 40s who developed a mild illness several days after returning from Europe. He and a household contact are isolating at home, NSW  Health  said on Friday. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said a preliminary test was positive and subsequent testing confirmed the case. The Victorian case was in a returned traveller from the UK. The man, in his 30s, developed mild symptoms before returning to Melbourne on 16 May and immediately sought medical attention. “Testing has confirmed that he has the virus and he remains in isolation at the Alfred with mild symptoms,” the Victoria health department said on Friday. Australia has joined a growing list of nations affected by the rare tropical illness including Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and the UK. Monkeypox occurs mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in humans in 1970. The illness can be transmitted from person to person through air droplets, close bodily contact or sharing contaminated linens or objects. Four countries in Africa – Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria – have reported cases of monkeypox in 2022. Chant said monkeypox was a rare virus that did not spread easily between people. It usually required “prolonged face-to-face contact” to spread, she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The chief health officer said people should be particularly vigilant if they had returned overseas “from large parties or sex-on-premises venues”. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said it was “doubtful” there would be a large number of cases in Australia “based on the long history of monkeypox already existing since 1970 in humans”. “My theory on this is that it’s party season in Europe and North America. They’ve come out of Covid and there’s a lot of partying going on … with close associations,” he said. Chant said the infection was “usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks”. She said people most at-risk were those with “severe underlying immunosuppression or disease … where those people may have a more torrid course and a worse outcome”. The general public and health clinics should be aware and have unusual skin rashes examined by specialist staff, the World Health Organization has said. The WHO also called for vigorous contact tracing around the spate of cases. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said state health authorities were closely monitoring the situation. “The advice I have is that it is a far less contagious condition than obviously Covid and things of that nature,” Morrison said in Perth. “We should be taking this seriously [but] at the same time I would say that no one should be alarmed at this point. We’ve got the best health authorities in the world.” Victoria’s health department said clinicians should consider testing for monkeypox in returned travellers with compatible symptoms. The state’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said suspected monkeypox clusters in Europe and North America appeared to be linked to West Africa. “That is a milder version of this monkeypox virus but it still has serious case fatality rates – so between 1% and 5%,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/australias-first-probable-case-of-monkeypox-virus-identified-in-nsw,The Guardian
WHO official warns monkeypox could accelerate as cases spread across Europe,,2022-05-20 23:06:00,"A top European health official has warned that cases of the rare  monkeypox  virus could accelerate in the coming months, as the virus spread across Europe. Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for  Europe , said that “as we enter the summer season … with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate”. The virus, which causes distinctive pustules but is rarely fatal, has previously been seen in central and west Africa. But over recent weeks cases have been detected in European countries including Portugal and Sweden as well as the United States, Canada and Australia, Kluge said, calling the spread “atypical”. “All but one of the recent cases have no relevant travel history to areas where monkeypox is endemic,” he added. The health official warned that transmission could be boosted by the fact that “the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity”, and many do not recognise the symptoms. Most initial cases of the disease have been among men who have sex with men and sought treatment at sexual health clinics, Kluge said, adding “this suggests that transmission may have been ongoing for some time”. The WHO has said it is investigating the fact that many cases reported were people identifying as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. The official’s statement came as France, Belgium and Germany reported their first cases of monkeypox and Italy confirmed it now had three linked cases of the disease. Belgium’s three confirmed cases of monkeypox were on Friday linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, organisers of the Darklands Festival said. French authorities said the virus had infected a 29-year-old man living in the area that includes Paris. In Spain, the health ministry has reported seven confirmed cases, and has said it is awaiting confirmation on 23 more. But a regional health official said the authorities had recorded 21 confirmed cases in the Madrid region, most linked to a gay-friendly sauna in the heart of the capital. It was likely these figures had not yet been included in the nationwide tally. Portugal has recorded 23 confirmed cases. UK health officials on Friday reported 11 more confirmed cases in England, taking its total to 20. The UK  Health  Security Agency’s chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, said she expected “this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community”. She particularly urged gay and bisexual men to look out for symptoms, saying a “notable proportion” of cases in the UK and Europe came from this group. Monkeypox had not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, the UKHSA said. It can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions and droplets of a contaminated person, as well as shared items such as bedding and towels. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, sought to reassure the public, tweeting: “Most cases are mild and I can confirm we have procured further doses of vaccines that are effective against monkeypox.” Symptoms of the disease include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face. The first UK case was announced on 7 May, in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria. Two more cases were reported a week later, in people in the same household. They had no link to the first case. The UKHSA said that four further cases announced on 16 May all identified as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men and appeared to have been infected in London. It said two new cases reported on 18 May also had no history of travel to countries where the virus is endemic and “it is possible they acquired the infection through community transmission”. It did not give any details of the latest cases reported on Friday. On Thursday, health authorities in Italy announced the country’s first case of monkeypox, in a young man recently returned from the Canary Islands. On Friday they said two further cases, linked to “patient zero”, had been confirmed. Monkeypox usually clears up after two to four weeks, according to the WHO.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/who-monkeypox-warning-cases-spread-europe,The Guardian
"Monkeypox outbreak: WHO working on sexual contact theory, top adviser says",Edward Helmore,2022-05-21 20:17:00,"A senior adviser for the  World Health Organization  has said the monkeypox outbreak seems to be spreading through sexual contact, and warned that case numbers could spike over the summer months as people attend major summer gatherings and festivals. David Heymann, chair of the WHO’s Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Infectious Hazards with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential, led a meeting of the group on Friday “because of the urgency of the situation”. Heymann told Reuters the WHO is working on the theory that cases so far identified were driven by sexual contact. “What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread, as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” Heymann said. Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said experts were likely to give more guidance to countries in the coming days.  Health  officials in several countries have warned that cases could rise further over the summer. Heymann said the monkeypox outbreak did not resemble the early days of Covid because it does not transmit as easily. “There are vaccines available, but the most important message is: you can protect yourself,” he said. The warning comes as a  New York  City resident has tested positive for the virus that causes monkeypox, health officials said, with the federal Centers for Disease Control investigating to determine whether the rare disease is actually present. Officials are treating the case as positive, and they have placed the patient – whose identity was not released – in isolation as they awaited final confirmation of the test result from the CDC. The notification came a day after authorities in New York City said they were investigating two potential cases. One of those potential cases in the city was ruled out, the state health department said. City epidemiologists have begun contacting people who may have been exposed to the person infected with Orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox. State and city officials have said they will try to determine how the New York patient was infected. The virus comes from wild animals, including rodents and primates, but can occasionally transfer to humans – with most of those cases traced to central and west Africa. The first known human infection dates back to 1970, when a nine-year-old boy in a remote part of DR Congo was diagnosed with the virus, which can cause fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with severe cases can also develop rash and pus-filled lesions on the face, palms of the hands and other body parts. The virus does not spread easily between people, though officials have said transmission can occur through contact with body fluids, monkeypox sores, items that have been contaminated with fluids or sores such as clothing and bedding, or through respiratory droplets following prolonged face-to-face contact. The apparent infection in New York comes as the WHO has identified about 80 cases globally, along with roughly 50 more suspected cases. The WHO warned more cases are likely to emerge. Infections have been confirmed in nine European countries, as well as the US, Canada and Australia. Health officials in Massachusetts confirmed its first case of the disease on Wednesday. Officials in the state have said the patient recently traveled to Canada. “The current patient is of no public health risk right now,” Dr Paul Biddinger, director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts general hospital said on Thursday. “People should just be aware of symptoms, but not be afraid in any way.” Cases of monkeypox  periodically show  in the US. Last year, Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who had recently traveled to Nigeria. In 2003, there was a six-state outbreak that infected 47 people. “Monkeypox is not a monkey virus,” D. Matt Aliota, head of the  University of Minnesota’s Program of Zoonotic Viral Infections , told  Minnesota’s Kare11  last week. “It was originally isolated out of a monkey, but monkeys aren’t the natural host. “It’s a virus that naturally infects small rodents and can then jump to humans through scratches or hunting and processing of meat.” In recent days, clinicians have been advised to treat patients with related symptoms as a “possible diagnosis” and to consult their state health department or the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center “as soon as monkeypox is suspected”. The advisory also gives  infection control information  to healthcare providers. Health officials have also made it a point to note that the monkeypox is harder to transmit – and therefore easier to contain – than the coronavirus. People who are exposed to monkeypox, which has a slow incubation period, can be given smallpox vaccines already in circulation to curb the severity of the sickness, according to the CDC.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/21/new-york-city-resident-monkeypox-virus-positive,The Guardian
‘Now we have to deal with it’: what’s going on in the UK with monkeypox?,Ian Sample,2022-05-20 15:09:00,"Because monkeypox is listed as a “high-consequence infectious disease”, the situation moved fast. The sample was sent to Porton Down science park in Wiltshire where the UK  Health  Security Agency’s rare and imported pathogens laboratory swiftly ran a PCR test. This confirmed the infection, which the agency announced the next day, on 7 May. Sporadic cases of monkeypox are rare, but not new in Britain. In total, seven cases have been recorded, in 2018, 2019 and 2021, all linked to travel to Nigeria where monkeypox is endemic. But as public health officials were soon to discover, this year was to be different. For the first time, doctors have uncovered chains of transmission in the community – not only in Britain – among people with no known links to travel. The UK has confirmed 20 cases, but more than 100 known or suspected cases are under investigation in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Australia. “It’s come into the UK, it’s come into other countries, and now we have to deal with it and figure out what’s going on,” said Prof David Heymann, distinguished fellow at the Chatham House global health programme and former executive director of the communicable diseases cluster for the World Health Organization. Monkeypox is a viral infection that most people shrug off. There are two forms. The more serious is the central African or Congo strain. The latest cases involve the milder west Africa strain. Data from Africa suggest about 1% of people with cases die. The concern is less around the impact on healthy people, but on the vulnerable – those with weakened immune systems, for example – and on the virus spreading in healthcare settings. Despite its name – the virus was first detected in macaques – most human cases of monkeypox are believed to come from contact with other infected animals, such as rodents. Historically, transmission between humans has been limited – infections sometimes spread in homes but soon fizzle out. The virus spreads through large respiratory droplets, calling for prolonged or frequent face-to-face contact, or contact with body fluids such as saliva, or skin lesions, either directly or through contaminated sheets, towels and other items. A week after confirming the first patient, the UKHSA reported two more in a family in London, with no links to the first case. The announcement on Saturday 14 May was “crucial” according to one doctor, because it  carried images of monkeypox lesions . These were seen by specialists struggling to diagnose patients with unexplained rashes at sexual health clinics. They immediately sent swabs to Porton Down, which confirmed the cases as monkeypox. On the Monday, the health agency confirmed four more cases, all men who have sex with men and appeared to have caught the virus in London. The increase in mostly unrelated cases prompted the UK’s chief medical officers to send immediate advice to healthcare workers via the NHS central alerting system. It called on providers to ensure they had sufficient PPE to assess and treat patients and noted that the smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, offered some protection against monkeypox if given soon after exposure. The vaccine is already being offered to healthcare workers and contacts of cases at high risk of infection, and the Department of Health has secured thousands of doses in case the outbreak grows. The alert put the spotlight on men who have sex with men (MSM), and a flurry of cases have since been confirmed, pointing to spread in sexual networks. While public health experts rush to contain the outbreak, they warn against focusing on any particular group. “This could easily have popped up in a different context,” said one senior specialist in sexual health. “The MSM phenomena may well have been a very quick way to have drawn our attention to there being skin-to-skin transmission in the community.” Asked why most cases are in men who have sex with men, Sir Ali Zumla, professor of infectious diseases and international health at University College London, urged people to avoid any “prejudicial, unfair and stigmatising” focus on the group. He said clusters of monkeypox could occur in any group in close contact with infected people. It was “highly unlikely” the clusters were due to any change in the virus, he added. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said “everyone” should be alert to monkeypox symptoms. “If you notice any unusual rashes or lesions consistent with monkeypox, please contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service, calling ahead before your visit. A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, which is why we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms. We are working to trace contacts of cases and offering vaccination where appropriate, and meanwhile we are rapidly investigating how the virus is transmitting to understand why we are seeing this unusual outbreak.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/now-we-have-to-deal-with-it-whats-going-on-in-the-uk-with-monkeypox,The Guardian
Second person in England diagnosed with monkeypox,Kevin Rawlinson,2018-09-11 18:56:00,"A second patient in England has been diagnosed with monkeypox, health officials have said, three days after the  first case of the rare virus  was confirmed. Public  Health  England (PHE) said it was unusual to see two cases in such a short space of time and officials were searching for anyone, including medical staff, who had come into contact with either patient, to offer them health advice. They stressed, however, that there was no UK link between the two patients and said the virus does not spread easily between people. The second patient was being treated in the tropical and infectious diseases unit of Royal  Liverpool  University hospital. The unit’s clinical director, Dr Mike Beadsworth, said staff there were highly trained and experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases. “All necessary precautions are being taken by specialist staff and there is currently no risk to other staff, patients or visitors,” he said. “We ask that people continue to use our services as normal and that people only come to our emergency department if their condition is serious and/or an emergency.” PHE said monkeypox was “usually a mild, self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.”  It said the virus could be spread by close contact with an infected person, but the risk of transmission to the general population was “very low”. The first patient to be diagnosed, who was from  Nigeria  and was staying at a naval base in Cornwall, is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London. The second patient had just returned to the UK from the west African nation, where each is believed to have contracted the virus, and first went to Blackpool Victoria hospital. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of PHE’s national infection service, said monkeypox was probably still circulating in Nigeria after an outbreak there a year ago. Besides medical staff, PHE said it was trying to contact passengers who were near the first patient on the flight to the UK. It said people who had no symptoms were not considered to be infectious and anyone who was not contacted did not need to take any action. “Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion,” PHE said. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/11/second-person-in-england-diagnosed-with-monkeypox,The Guardian
Biden says ‘everybody’ should be concerned about spread of monkeypox,Ramon Antonio Vargas,2022-05-22 14:39:00,"Joe Biden said on Sunday that “everybody” should be worried about the spread of monkeypox recently, and his national security adviser assured the public that the US has a “vaccine that is relevant to treating” the virus. During an official visit to South Korea, Biden told reporters, “They haven’t told me the level of exposure yet but it is something that everybody should be concerned about.” The president, who was speaking at Osan airbase, also added: “It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential.” Initially, Biden said the government was exploring what vaccine “if any might be available” to protect people against the virus. But later his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the US had a “vaccine available to be deployed” against the monkeypox virus if necessary. Officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have previously said that people who are exposed to monkeypox, which has a slow incubation period, can be given existing smallpox vaccines to limit the sickness’s severity. Biden’s first remarks on the growing outbreak of the rare virus came a day after a senior adviser for the World Health Organization said the monkeypox seemed to be spreading through sexual contact and admonished that case numbers could continue climbing over the summer as people attended festivals and other major gatherings. “What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread, as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” said the WHO adviser, David Heymann. Entering Sunday, public health authorities had confirmed about 80 cases in nine European countries, along with the US, Canada and Australia. Another 50 cases were suspected infections awaiting confirmation. In the US, Massachusetts health officials confirmed the first case of the disease in that state on Wednesday. That patient had recently traveled to Canada. A New York City resident later in the week tested positive for the virus which causes monkeypox, with the CDC on Saturday still investigating whether the illness was present. The virus comes from wild animals, including rodents and primates, but can occasionally transfer to humans – with most of those cases traced to central and west Africa. It can cause fever, body aches, chills and fatigue, and it occasionally shows up in the US, including last year in a couple of people who had just traveled to Nigeria. People with severe cases can also develop rash and pus-filled lesions on the face, palms of the hands and other body parts. The virus does not spread easily between people, but transmission can occur through contact with body fluids, monkeypox sores, touching clothing or bedding that have been contaminated with fluids or sores, or through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact. Health officials have made it a point to say that the monkeypox is harder to spread – and therefore easier to contain – than Covid-19.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/22/biden-monkeypox-infections-spread,The Guardian
Monkeypox alert in Spain after 23 people show symptoms,Sam Jones,2022-05-18 12:54:00,"Health authorities in Spain have issued an alert over a possible outbreak of monkeypox after 23 people showed symptoms compatible with the viral infection, which has already  been detected in the UK  and Portugal. The health ministry cautioned that the suspected cases – all in the Madrid region – had yet to be confirmed, but said a nationwide alert had been issued “to guarantee a swift, coordinated and timely response”. Madrid’s regional health department said the suspected cases were being analysed by the National Microbiology Centre to obtain a definitive diagnosis. “Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the 23 suspected cases point towards transmission through mucus during sexual relations,” it said in a statement. “The people involved are doing well and are isolating at home, but a close eye is being kept on them in case they need hospital treatment.” Fernando Simón, an epidemiologist who heads Spain’s health emergencies centre, said while it was unlikely that monkeypox would spread significantly, “that can’t be ruled out”.  Portuguese authorities have confirmed five cases and are investigating another 15 suspected cases. In a statement on Wednesday, Portugal’s health ministry said the cases it had detected – all in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region – had all involved men whose symptoms included ulcerative lesions. “The UK has reported similar cases of ulcerative lesions, with confirmed monkeypox virus infection,” it said. “We are monitoring the situation at national level and in conjunction with European institutions.” The first of the seven cases logged in the UK involved a person who had recently been to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the infection. According to the UK  Health  Security Agency, all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The health body is asking these groups “to be alert” to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. A rash that can look like chickenpox or syphilis can also develop and spread from the face to other parts of the body, including the genitals. Most people recover within a few weeks. A handful of cases of monkeypox, which has two forms and is typically found in central and western Africa, have been diagnosed in the UK in the past. It is thought the seven UK cases involve the west African strain, which is milder than the more severe central African, or Congo, strain.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/monkeypox-alert-spain-men-show-symptoms,The Guardian
Monkeypox traced to African rat,,,"An outbreak of monkeypox which has affected 81 people has been traced to a Gambian giant rat and assorted other small rodents imported as pets from Africa, US health officials said on Wednesday.  The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the infection in one Gambian giant rat, three dormice and two rope squirrels shipped in April.  The animals were kept in close contact with prairie dogs at a Texas importer. The prairie dogs, native to the American plains but popular as pets, were shipped to Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.  The CDC suspects that 81 people were infected by the animals and has confirmed 32 cases with testing. More than 20 have been vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine, which may help to protect against the worst symptoms of monkeypox.  Monkeypox is related to smallpox, and has similar symptoms but is much less deadly. It is usually seen in central and western Africa.  Once it was confirmed, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration banned the import of all African rodents into the US.  The CDC said it was issuing guidance to pet shops and veterinarians about how to prevent further spread of the virus, which in Africa kills up to 10% of human patients. No one in the US has died in the outbreak.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/sciencenews.theguardianlifesupplement,The Guardian
Patient treated for monkeypox in isolation at London hospital,Miranda Bryant,2022-05-07 15:36:00,"A patient is being treated at a specialist unit in London after they were diagnosed with monkeypox, a rare viral infection. The person had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the illness, the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Saturday. They are being treated in an isolation unit at Guy’s and St Thomas’ infectious disease unit. Although monkeypox can be spread during close contact with an infected person, the agency said it did not spread easily and most people recovered in a few weeks. As a precaution, the UKHSA said its experts were working closely with the NHS and would be contacting those who may have had close contact with the person, including some passengers who were on the same flight. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other areas of the body. The rash progresses through different states until it forms a scab which falls off. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said “It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.” He added: “UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.” Dr Nicholas Price, director of NHSE high consequence infection diseases (airborne) network and consultant in infectious diseases at Guy’s and St Thomas’, said: “The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas’ hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.” The NHS said infection could be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa and was believed to be spread by rodents. Only a few people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, all of whom had either travelled to west Africa or been in close contact with somebody who had. According to information produced by Public Health England (the agency replaced by UKHSA last year), monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a “pox-like disease” were found in monkeys in captivity for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since then, it said, most cases have been reported from DRC and Nigeria, but there have been a handful of cases further afield. In 2003, cases were recorded in humans and pet prairie dogs in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. In December 2019, a patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, which PHE said was the fourth case diagnosed in the UK since the first imported cases the year before. There have also been cases in Israel and Singapore.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/patient-treated-for-monkeypox-in-isolation-at-london-hospital,The Guardian
"Monkeypox could significantly disrupt UK sexual health services, expert says",Jane Clinton,2022-05-21 11:57:00,"Monkeypox could have a “massive impact” on access to UK sexual health services, a leading doctor has warned. Dr Claire Dewsnap, the president of the British Association for Sexual  Health  and HIV, has voiced concern about how the viral infection could affect services as staff who come into contact with sufferers are forced to isolate. She told the BBC that clinic staff were already under significant pressure before monkeypox was identified. “It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who’s infected,” she said. As of Friday, there were 20 confirmed cases of the disease in the UK, and nine other countries outside central and west Africa have also reported outbreaks. Monkeypox, which was first detected in 1958, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. Dewsnap told BBC Radio 4: “In terms of the infection and its consequences for individuals, I’m not that concerned, but I am concerned about our ability to maintain good sexual health services and access for everyone while still managing this new infection.” She called for “adequate funding” for sexual health services that she said had experienced cuts to their budgets over the past decade, adding that the ability to see people quickly was important when dealing with infection. “Over the last 10 years, there’s been a significant decrease in funding through the public health budget, and that has seen a direct effect on staffing level and that means we have less capacity to see people,” she told BBC Breakfast. “We used to be able to see people within 48 hours of them contacting us – that’s really important because it cuts down the window where people have an infection [while] they don’t know they have an infection and therefore they can pass it on to people. “So, the speed in which we see people is really critical, and monkeypox coming along shows us that more than ever before.” She said proper funding would mean they could “ensure people can get in quickly, and therefore we can reduce the risk of infection of other people”. Meanwhile, Prof Sir Peter Horby, the director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, described the monkeypox outbreak as “an unusual situation” because the virus is being transmitted within communities outside central and west Africa. “It’s transmitted by close person-to-person contact and in the past we have not seen it being very infectious,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What’s unusual about what we’re seeing now is that we’re seeing transmission occurring in the community in Europe and now in other countries, so it’s an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now have ongoing transmission within certain communities.” He added: “It would appear that there is some element of sexual transmission, perhaps with just the very close contact between people and the skin lesions, because a large proportion of the current cases are being detected in gay and bisexual men. “So it’s very important that we get the message across that if people have unusual skin lesions that they do seek attention quickly so that we can control this. “The important thing is that we interrupt transmission and this doesn’t become established in the human population in Europe.” The UK Health Security Agency has said the infection can be transmitted through “close contact or contact with clothing or linens used by a person who has monkeypox”. However, it added that the virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population “remains low”. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitalia. The rash then changes and goes through different stages – and can resemble chickenpox – before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. According to the  NHS , symptoms are usually mild and clear up in “two to four weeks”, although severe cases can sometimes occur. The UK government has said it is stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against monkeypox.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/monkeypox-disruption-sexual-health-services,The Guardian
"Two people diagnosed with monkeypox in London, health officials say",Harry Taylor,2022-05-14 12:37:00,"Two more people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in  London , health officials said. The pair live in the same household and are not linked to the  previous confirmed case in England  that was announced on 7 May, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Of the latest two cases, one person is receiving care at the infectious disease unit at St Mary’s hospital, Imperial College healthcare NHS trust in London. The other is isolating and does not currently require hospital treatment, the UKHSA said. Health officials said they were investigating where transmission took place and how the people had become infected.  Contact tracing is taking place, the agency said, with those who have been in close contact with the diagnosed cases being given information and health advice. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, and people tend to recover within two to four weeks. The virus is mainly found in tropical forests in central and western Africa. Dr Colin Brown, the UKHSA’s director of clinical and emerging infections, said: “We have confirmed two new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on 7 May. “While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low. “We are contacting any potential friends, family or contacts in the community. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.” Prof Julian Redhead, the medical director of Imperial College healthcare NHS trust said: “We are caring for a patient in our specialist high-consequence infectious diseases unit at St Mary’s hospital. “All of the necessary infectious control procedures have been followed and we are working closely with UKHSA and NHS England.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/14/two-people-diagnosed-with-monkeypox-in-london-health-officials,The Guardian
First ever case of monkeypox recorded in the UK,,2018-09-08 18:41:00,"The first ever case of monkeypox has been recorded in the UK. The rare viral infection was recorded on Friday in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall,  Public Health England  said. The patient was transferred to the infectious disease unit at the Royal Free hospital in London on Saturday morning. They are believed to have contracted the infection in  Nigeria  before travelling to the UK. PHE said monkeypox does not spread easily and most patients recover within a few weeks, but it can cause severe illness in some people. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab that falls off. PHE said that, as a precautionary measure, it is working with experts in the NHS to contact a number of people who were on the same flight as the patient. The body has not revealed whether the patient is a member of the military, or confirmed their gender. PHE said in a statement: “People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.” The organisation said passengers that are not contacted need take no action. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free, said: “Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. Most people recover within several weeks. “It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. “We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: “PHE and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported and infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/08/first-ever-case-of-monkeypox-recorded-in-the-uk,The Guardian
Should we worry about monkeypox?,Alok Jha,,"There's little reason to. Although at least 33 people have been infected with the virus in the American midwest and there is no treatment for it, experts believe they will all recover. The disease can kill though. The largest outbreak in Africa infected around 500 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997, killing at least five children.  This is the first time the virus, which comes from the same family as smallpox and cowpox, has appeared outside Africa. The infection was carried to the US by a Gambian giant pouched rat (above), which is thought to have passed the virus on to people via local prairie dogs.  The infection was first identified in a captive monkey around 30 years ago, although subsequent studies have shown the virus also infects other animals in central and west Africa, in particular rodents.  ""The name monkeypox sticks, but monkeys are not that important as reservoirs of the virus,"" says Paul Fine, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  ""For monkeys, it's their equivalent of smallpox,"" says Mike Skinner at the Institute for Animal Health. ""The indications are that it's not endemic in monkeys so they're getting it from something like rodents. We don't know what the main animal reservoir is in Africa.""  People living in rural areas of west Africa are regularly exposed to the virus and infections are common.  Fine says the disease starts like many others with a fever and sometimes backache, coughs and a sweat. The symptoms develop with a rash, which starts as red spots that harden, blister, and finally become scabs.  While there is no treatment for monkeypox, anyone vaccinated against smallpox will be protected. In Africa, the fatality rate has reached 10% in the past, with children most at risk. ""It's not a highly transmissible virus,"" says Fine.  ""The key issue is if it gets out into the wild prairie dog population of the US,"" says Fine. If the virus becomes endemic in the millions of prairie dogs, the number of human infections would certainly rise, he says.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jun/12/thisweekssciencequestions,The Guardian
"UK's monkeypox outbreak passes 1,000 cases: Milestone reached as virus continues to spread among gay and bi men — but gloomy model warns of 60,000 cases a DAY by Christmas",Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-06-28 15:57:00,"Monkeypox  cases in the UK have risen above 1,000 as the rare disease continues to spread, officials confirmed today. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said there had been 1,076 infections as of Sunday, almost double the number a fortnight ago. Authorities said they expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and are advising anyone going to large events or having sex with new partners to 'be alert' for symptoms. Cases continue to be predominantly among gay and bisexual men and the UK's outbreak has been linked to raves, saunas and dating apps, with the virus mostly spreading through sex.  It came as modelling by a Strathclyde University professor warned the outbreak could continue for another year and infect tens of thousands of Britons daily in a worst-case scenario. The simulation assumes all under-50s — the last age group to get a smallpox vaccine, which provides cross-protection —  are susceptible to monkeypox. Other scientists do not expect the virus to ever reach the heights of Covid waves because monkeypox requires prolonged close contact or contaminated surfaces to spread. Announcing Britain's new cases today, Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at the UKHSA, said: 'The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.  'We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.

Under one 'very pessimistic scenario', infections peak at 60,000, the total number of people infected nears 20million and the epidemic lasts for more than one year. 'The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities,' Professor Kleczkowski said. ENDEMIC: Under separate modelling, Professor Kleczkowski said that due to monkeypox's low transmissibility and long incubation period — which allows it to survive at low levels in the population — it is possible that the virus has already been spreading in the UK 'for a long time'. Following the current spike in infections, the disease may 'settle on a long-term, relatively constant level' similar to how smallpox and chickenpox spread before vaccines were rolled out. Under this model, 'mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease', he said RECURRENT LARGE EPIDEMICS: In a separate model from Professor Kleczkowski, the current outbreak could be 'the first instance of a serious of outbreaks' fuelled by zoonotic transmission — when the disease jumps from an animal to a human — and cause sporadic surges of infection in the future. 'As the cross-immunity from smallpox vaccines wanes, the epidemics can become even more substantial,' he said. While little is known about monkeypox's potential to mutate, there is room for it to 'evolve into a more rapidly spreading variant', Professor Kleczkowski said SELF-LIMITING OUTBREAK: However, in his least severe set of calculations, he suggested that the outbreak took off due to a super-spreader event involving a network of men who have sex with men. In this scenario, the outbreak 'ends quickly' once the population at risk becomes immune and heard immunity is reached locally Previous 1 Next                                     : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria.

The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   'Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk. 'If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.' Dozens of countries have logged cases of monkeypox, which is usually only spotted in Africa and has until now fizzled out after a handful of cases in other parts of the world.  Almost all infections so far have been spotted in men who have sex with men abroad, as well. Professor Adam Kleczkowski, a mathematician at the University of Strathclyde, warned Britain's infections could keep rising until the end of year — when a peak of 60,000 people could be catching the virus every day. 'Unless a combination of contact tracing and ring vaccination stops the spread, the monkeypox will continue spreading,' Professor Kleczkowski said.  To calculate how the monkeypox outbreak could continue to spread in the UK, Professor Kleczkowski estimated that each infected person would go on to infect two more people — known as the R rate. He said 53 per cent of a population would need to be infected for enough people to have immunity to stop the virus spreading — known as herd immunity. And the incubation period — the length of time from catching the virus to when symptoms start — was five to 21 days. Based on these parameters, he modelled how the outbreak would unfold if all males aged 50 and under are susceptible to the virus. This equates to 40 per cent of the UK's population — around 26.8million people — and is classified as a 'large population at risk'. He said the parameters are based on the over-50s likely having some immunity from smallpox vaccinations, which the UK stopped rolling out in 1971, and the spread so far mainly occurring among men.  Anyone can catch the virus, which is spread by close contact with an infected person.  But most cases in the ongoing surge are among the 'sexual networks' of men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection. But sex is thought to be the main mode of transmission in the ongoing outbreak. The virus, first discovered in lab monkeys in the 1950s, can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone who is infected.  Under the 'very pessimistic scenario', infections peak at 60,000, the total number of people infected nears 20million and the epidemic lasts for more than one year.  'The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities,' Professor Kleczkowski said. However, he noted that he does not have a 'working model' of the outbreak but aimed to produce 'believable scenarios of what could happen in the near future'. The calculations are based on modelling up to June 17 and are 'likely to change' as new data emerges, he said. And since his modelling on June 17, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed some gay and bisexual men will be offered the smallpox Imvanex vaccine — which is 85 per cent effective against monkeypox — to control the outbreak. Under the plans, which come from the same experts who advised on the Covid vaccine rollout, medics will offer the jab to men who have multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues. Until the move was announced last week, the jab was only offered to confirmed cases and their close contacts under a strategy called ring vaccination, which has been proven to work in other outbreaks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: 'By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak.' Under separate modelling, Professor Kleczkowski said that due to monkeypox's low transmissibility and long incubation period — which allows it to survive at low levels in the population — it is possible that the virus has already been spreading in the UK 'for a long time'. Following the current spike in infections, the disease may 'settle on a long-term, relatively constant level' similar to how smallpox spread before vaccines were rolled out. Under this model, 'mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease', he said.  A third model from Professor Kleczkowski sets out that the current outbreak could be 'the first instance of a series of outbreaks' fuelled by zoonotic transmission — when the disease jumps from an animal to a human — and cause sporadic surges of infection in the future. 'As the cross-immunity from smallpox vaccines wanes, the epidemics can become even more substantial,' he said. While little is known about monkeypox's potential to mutate, there is room for it to 'evolve into a more rapidly spreading variant', Professor Kleczkowski said.  However, in a fouth model — his least severe set of calculations — the outbreak 'ends quickly' once the population at risk becomes immune and herd immunity is reached locally. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious It comes as US health chiefs yesterday announced that monkeypox has mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. A team from the NIH studied 15 samples of the virus from the current outbreak. They restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. The researchers could not determine why the virus is changing faster than expected. But they believe that the finding could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year, which has seen 201 cases in the US. Meanwhile, the UKHSA last week set out a strategy for some gay and bisexual men at 'higher risk' of exposure to monkeypox to be offered a vaccine to control the outbreak. Officials have not put a number on how many men will be included in the rollout. Under the plans, endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), those eligible for  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — a pill that protects against HIV — will also be eligible for the vaccine. This includes people who do not always use condoms during sex and are likely to continue not using them, as well as sex workers or their clients who report having unprotected sex. NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted. As well as gay and bisexual men, the list of NHS staff eligible for the jab is also being expanded. Healthcare workers caring for monkeypox patients in specialist high consequence infectious disease (HICD) wards are already offered the jab. But now staff in other hospitals designed to care for monkeypox patients will also be offered the jab, as well as workers in laboratories that test for the virus. The UKHSA is urging all Britons to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have had close contact with a new partner. Those with symptoms are told to avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre.  ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10961075/UKs-monkeypox-outbreak-passes-1-000-cases-gloomy-model-warns-doomsday-scenario.html,The Daily Mail
"US allowed monkeypox vaccine stockpile to dwindle 99.99% from 20million to 2,400 doses because officials only 'planned for smallpox' and were working on shot with a longer shelf-life: California and Illinois declare state of emergency",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-02 17:32:00,"The United States allowed its  monkeypox  vaccine stockpile to dwindle from 20million to just 2,400 doses because it had only planned for a smallpox outbreak and was working on alternatives, it was revealed today — as  California  and  Illinois  declared a state of emergency over the virus. Official documents showed how the 'strategic' stockpile was allowed to plummet to 0.012 percent from its peak in 2013, as doses of the Jynneos vaccine — which only have a three-year shelf life — ran out. An attempt was made to restock it in 2015 when another 8million doses were ordered. Once these were expired, America signed for another 1.3million — but mostly these were still in Denmark when monkeypox struck because the Food and Drug Administration still hadn't inspected their manufacturing facility. Thousands of gay or bisexual men have been left waiting weeks to get doses, with many left with no option but to spend hours sitting at home hitting refresh on their browsers in the hopes of securing a coveted appointment. States have also complained they are getting too few doses from the national stockpile. The revelation published by the  New York Times  came as America's cases tally hit 5,800, with a further 622 infections detected this weekend. There have been no deaths to date, but four have been detected outside Africa including two in Spain which has a similar-sized outbreak. California and Illinois — which have the second and third highest case counts — both said they would declare a state of emergency over monkeypox today. They join New York City and San Francisco in hitting the panic button over the outbreak, although federal officials are yet to make a similar move. America once had 20million doses of Jynneos vaccine - the preferred option for fighting monkeypox - in its national stockpile. But these jabs, with a shelf-life of three years, quickly expired. It has moved to replenish stocks since then, but bought less as the strategy shifted to developing a longer-lived jab The above map shows where in the U.S. monkeypox cases have been detected. New York has the largest outbreak and is the only state to confirm more than 1,000 cases Pictured above are men waiting in line for the monkeypox vaccine in Encino, California. It came after the state's governor declared a state of emergency in the area Pictured above are men standing in long lines to get doses of the monkeypox vaccine in San Francisco in early July. The city was the first place to declare monkeypox an emergency America's national stockpile of these jabs was ramped up after the 9/11 attacks over fears terrorist groups could get hold of and re-release the smallpox virus, which is currently eradicated. The Jynneous doses were only ever meant to be offered to vulnerable people in this case, such as young children and older adults. Millions of doses of other jabs like ACAM2000 and Dryvax were held for the general population, but these are generally not preferred because of the risk of side-effects. As the Bavarian Nordic-made jabs expired, however, federal officials decided to invest in developing new 'freeze-dried' jabs that could last for up to ten years — or three-times longer than current stocks.  Previous 1 Next                   : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like virus occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the virus is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the virus at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 5,000 cases nationwide. : Monkeypox cases are detected in children and a pregnant woman in the U.S., in a sign it is spreading to other groups. They have invested more than $1billion in this to date, but the longer-lived jabs are still yet to be developed. Amid dwindling supplies, the Federal Government also switched to buying the vaccine in bulk — or as a fluid stored in plastic bags. This is stored in Denmark and could not immediately be rolled out because it still needed to be filled-and-finished, or put into vials to be distributed to the population. An order of 1.3million more Jynneos doses was placed in 2020 to augment the national stockpile records showed.  Of these, 372,000 doses had been filled and finished by an FDA-approved contractor meaning they could quickly be shipped to the U.S. for use. But the rest — nearly a million jabs — went through this process at the company's new factory which was yet to get the rubber-stamp from the FDA. It meant that when monkeypox struck they were held up in Denmark while officials carried out the inspection. Federal  officials revealed that when monkeypox first struck they had just 2,400 Jynneos doses available. Dr Gary Disbrow, who directed the agency that supported the development of Jynneos and other jabs, told the NYT that with the national stockpile: 'Our planning was for smallpox.' 'We have to prepare against multiple threats with a limited budget.' Monkeypox — which had been known since the early 1950s from Africa — had not entered high on their list of threats because it generally did not circulate beyond the continent. All the vaccines being used were designed to fight smallpox, but officials say they can also be used against monkeypox because the two viruses are closely related. It was revealed as the governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency over the monkeypox outbreak, joining New York and San Francisco. Both states have seen cases escalate in recent weeks, with California now having the second-biggest outbreak in the country and Illinois the third largest. They have declared the emergencies to make more resources available to combat the virus, and ramp up the number of people that can dish out the jabs. Declaring the emergency in California, Governor Gavin Newsom said the state was 'working urgently... to slow the spread of monkeypox.' He added they were leveraging testing and contact tracing knowledge from the pandemic to fight the virus. Local LGBT group Equality California applauded the move, saying in a statement that the virus 'continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men'.  Pictured above are vials of the monkeypox and smallpox vaccine in Chicago, Illinois, after the state today declared an emergency over the outbreak of the virus In Illinois, Governor JB Pritzker said: 'I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and co-ordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating and preventing the spread of monkeypox. 'In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBT community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.' It is understood that the federal government is also considering declaring monkeypox an emergency, but is yet to take the step. It was reported this could be as soon as last week.  California has received 61,000 doses of the vaccine to date, and in some areas is aiming to roll them out to everyone who requests one. Los Angeles is receiving a separate vaccine allocation. This tally is far below the 600,000 to 800,000 jabs that have been requested. The health department says it is 'hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state's request'. To date more than 336,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine have been dished out to states from the national stockpile. A further almost 800,000 doses have also been delivered to the country, and are now being allocated to different states and cities. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11073415/US-allowed-monkeypox-vaccine-stockpile-dwindle-99-99-20million-2-400-doses.html,The Daily Mail
"Monkeypox cases in UK rise by 159 to 1,235 as health officials issue warning ahead of Pride weekend urging people not to attend if they have symptoms or feel unwell",Elizabeth Haigh For Mailonline,2022-07-02 09:45:00,"Monkeypox  cases in the UK continue to rise ahead of the  London  Pride parade later today, now reaching 1,235 confirmed cases. Officials have now released a warning urging anyone who thinks they might have monkeypox to stay away from the parade to avoid further spread. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the number of cases jumped by a further 159 by June 30, up from 1,076 on June 28.  Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: 'The monkeypox outbreak continues to grow.  Pride events began yesterday, July 1, and will culminate in a hue parade through central London later today Examples of the monkeypox rash, which can appear anywhere on the body and often spreads to the genital area 'Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.  'This weekend, let’s enjoy Pride safely – before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes.  'Please don’t attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell. If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested.  'Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks – especially if you are having sex with someone new.  'To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners, to help us limit further transmission where cases occur.' Meanwhile top public-health doctor Professor Kevin Fenton has also urged anyone with suspected symptoms to stay at home and contact the NHS for advice. It was time for clear messages, Prof Fenton told  BBC News . ""If you think you may have monkeypox - blisters, fevers, swollen glands - please do not go out over the weekend,"" he said. ""Stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice."" Professor Fenton expects a further rise in cases in coming weeks as it can take time for symptoms to appear. London Mayor Sadiq Khan echoed calls for anyone with possible symptoms to stay at home. But he added it was essential the parade goes ahead as planned after the recent shooting at Oslo's pride event in June.  The UKHSA says it has been advising and working with organisers of mass events throughout the outbreak, which has emerged in the last couple of months. Gay and bisexual men have been 'disproportionately affected' health officials have said. Monkeypox is spreading across the world as well as in the UK - with African countries appealing for help as the outbreak across the west is reflected in a rise in cases for them too Although there is no clear evidence as to why the majority of cases have been identified in members of the LGBT+ community, it is thought this may be to do with the fact gay and bisexual men tend to have more awareness of, and get checked more regularly for, sexually transmitted diseases. This means they are more likely to notice changes such as rashes and blisters. Until this year monkeypox had not seen a widespread global outbreak, instead being limited mainly to parts of Africa.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. MAY 7, 2022: A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. MAY 14, 2022: Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. MAY 16, 2022: Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The spate of cases was described as 'unusual' and 'surprising' as experts warn gay and bisexual men to look out for new rashes. MAY 19, 2022: Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. MAY 20, 2022: Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them MAY 23, 2022: Scotland logs its first ever monkeypox case and 36 more infection announced in England. It brings the UK total to 57. MAY 24, 2022: England logs another 14 cases, bringing the UK total to 71. MAY 25, 2022: Another seven infections are spotted in England, meaning 78 cases have been detected in the UK. MAY 26, 2022: Wales and Northern Ireland detect their first monkeypox case in the recent outbreak, while Scotland spots two more cases and England logs eight, bringing UK total to 90. MAY 27, 2022: England detects 16 more cases, meaning 106 people in Britain have confirmed infections. MAY 29, 2022: World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. MAY 30, 2022: The UK detects another 71 monkeypox cases, bringing the UK total to 179. Cases jumped 70 per cent in just three days. MAY 31, 2022: Eleven infections are spotted across the UK, bringing the infection toll to 190. JUNE 1, 2022: Another five cases are spotted in England and one is detected in Scotland, meaning the UK has now logged 196. JUNE 2, 2022: The UK spots another 11 cases in England, bringing the UK total to 207. JUNE 3, 2022: A further 18 cases are logged - 15 in England and three in Scotland, bringing Britain's monkeypox infection toll to 225. JUNE 6, 2022: Seventy-three cases are spotted in England, 2 in Scotland and 2 in Wales, bringing the UK total to 302. JUNE 8, 2022: Some 18 people in England and one in Scotland test positive, meaning 321 people have had infections confirmed. JUNE 10, 2022: Forty-three more cases are spotted in England and one in each in Scotland and Wales. The UK has now confirmed 366 infections. JUNE 13, 2022: Another 103 cases are spotted in England, bringing UK total to 470. JUNE 15, 2022: Another 52 cases are identified in England, and one each in Wales and Scotland, bringing the total infections to 524. JUNE 15, 2022: A further 50 cases are identified in the UK, bringing the total infections to 574.  JUNE 21, 2022: The UKHSA changes how often infection rates are reported. The current UK total is 793 confirmed cases, with 766 of those in England JUNE 24, 2022: Another 107 cases are reported, bringing the total to 873. JUNE 28, 2022: The UKHSA announced another 166 monkeypox cases, taking the total over 1,000 to 1,076. JULY 1, 2022: The day before the London Pride parade it is announced there are 1,235 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK. Attendees are advised to check themselves for any unusual rashes or symptoms before travelling to Pride. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. According to the UKHSA, monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people and the overall risk to the UK population remains low. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash then tends to blister and scab over before eventually drying and falling off.  Of the 1,235 cases, the UKHSA has confirmed that 77 per cent of those affected who have a registered address are residents of London. Of the 1,185 cases where gender data is available, 1,180 cases appeared in men with just five in women. The median age of infection in the UK so far is 37. London alone now has had 692 confirmed cases, with a further 287 cases where the location has not yet been determined. There are fears that the London Pride parade, which takes place today, could lead to further spread due to the close proximity of people. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to descend on the capital to celebrate. The event will mark the 50th anniversary of the first ever Pride parade in the UK, which saw just a couple of thousand attendees.  Pride in London's 2022 parade will start at Hyde Park Corner at midday, before making its way through Piccadilly and Piccadilly Circus and then turning south on Haymarket. From there it will travel towards Trafalgar Square before finishing in Whitehall at around 6pm. The event is set to see performances from huge stars, and will be headlined by Ava Max. The Trafalgar Square Stage will feature singer Emeli Sandé, Eurovision-winning superstar Netta, pop and soul icon Samantha Mumba, and Hollywood actress and Long Hot Summer singer Kat Graham. Other performers across the stages today include Tony nominee Justin Vivian Bond, stars of Pride’s recent Proud & Loud concert at the Royal Albert Hall Cat Burns and Ariōn, along with Drag Race Superstars The Vivienne, Lawrence Chaney, Tia Kofi and Victoria Scone. Cast members from hit musicals Kinky Boots and Romeo & Juliet will also make an appearance. But gay rights activist and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who helped to organise the first ever Pride event in 1972, yesterday said the parade had become 'too corporate and commercial.' Speaking about the main event, Mr Tatchell said: 'A lot of us are very concerned that the main official Pride event has become too corporate and commercial. 'It often looks like a huge PR, marketing and branding exercise by big companies. 'The human rights dimension has been lost. The original Pride was both a celebration and a protest. 'That's the way it should be this year as well. 'We need to remember that there are still issues to fight for, particularly globally where 69 countries continue to criminalise same sex relations - 12 Muslim majority countries still have the death penalty.' At least 61 countries have reported outbreaks of monkeypox cases. In Europe, the UK leads with the most confirmed infections, followed by Germany, Spain, Portugal and France. The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. But despite these efforts, there are fears that the monkeypox outbreak, combined with a resurgence of coronavirus and an expected early wave of flu, could cause massively increase pressures on the NHS. MailOnline reported yesterday that health officials have said they are expecting an 'early influenza wave' in the UK because there has not been a 'proper' flu season since the start of the Covid pandemic. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said she is watching Australia - currently in its winter season - 'very carefully' after a strain of influenza 'started early and spread fast across all age groups'. She said the country is 'having its worst flu season in five years', which could replicate in the UK as early as September. Meanwhile, Dr Hopkins added that we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox'. There are also mounting fears that the NHS will be struck down at the same time by Covid, with colder weather and darker evenings leading to increased social contact indoors — where viruses find it easier to spread. This year's march will mark the 50th anniversary of Lonodn's first ever Pride parade in 1972, and will be led by veterans of that event and the Gay Liberation Front Previous 1 Next             There is expected to be a focus on the rights of LGBT+ people around the world, as well as the government's refusal to expand the conversion therapy ban to transgender people Flu is a seasonal menace on the NHS, with outbreaks more likely between September and March because colder weather forces more people indoors where the virus — like Covid — finds it easier to spread. But influenza virtually disappeared last winter amid lockdowns aiming to control the spread of Covid. Speaking on Thursday in a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr Hopkins said: 'We are planning for an influenza wave. I don't know if people re following Australia, but we are watching very, very carefully. 'It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave. 'While we normally don't see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October – that's what we're planning for.' She added: 'We will see at least one Covid wave in the autumn-winter, once we have got through the current wave. And, for the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox.' Coronavirus infections have just jumped by 30 per cent, with around 2.3 million people infected last week.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10975461/Monkeypox-cases-UK-rise-1-235-health-officials-issue-warning-ahead-Pride-parade.html,The Daily Mail
"Monkeypox cases are spreading into every region of the UK as vaccination campaign against disease falters, experts warn",Ethan Ennals For The Mail On Sunday,2022-08-06 22:26:00,"Monkeypox  cases are now spreading into every region of the country while the vaccination campaign against the virus is faltering, experts have warned. When the virus – which causes painful blisters across the body – first arrived in the UK in May, the vast majority of infections were recorded in  London . Last month, regional cases accounted for only a fifth of the total. But now, more than 2,800 cases have been confirmed, and according to Government figures over a third are in regions outside of London. Particularly high numbers have been seen in the South East, which has recorded more than 230 cases, and the North West, with 150. Currently monkeypox is predominantly infecting gay men and spread through close contact, but the updated figures come as sexual health experts warn that overwhelming demand for the vaccine being offered mean at-risk men are struggling to access it. A long-standing smallpox vaccine has been deployed to inoculate against monkeypox because of the viruses’ high level of similarity. And scientists say a successful vaccination campaign is crucial because the virus can be deadly if it reaches children or pregnant women. Experts have warned the monkeypox vaccine campaign is faltering. Pictured is a man being vaccinated against the disease in Lille, France, today Last week, the US – which has seen more than 6,600 monkeypox cases and declared it a public health emergecy – reported that five children and one pregnant woman have caught the virus. None of the cases was life-threatening, but reports suggest at least ten adults have now died worldwide after catching the disease. The Mail on Sunday was first to report concerns among clinicians of a shortage of monkeypox vaccines last month. Insiders told this newspaper that at least 200,000 doses would be needed, but only 30,000 jabs were on hand. A week later, health chiefs announced they had purchased an extra 100,000. However, London clinicians say supplies are arriving slowly. Previous 1 Next             ‘The majority of London clinics are running out of vaccines on a daily basis and are desperately trying to work with what little they have,’ says Dr John McSorley, a consultant sexual health expert at London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust. ‘Clinics are essentially running like budget airlines – overbooking patients for jabs they don’t have in the hope they’ll have enough on the day.’ Dr McSorley, former president of the British Association For Sexual Health And HIV, said the spread of monkeypox into other regions of the country is the direct effect of this slow rollout. ‘These rising numbers around the country are the result of inaction from the Government. ‘We need to get ahead of this disease while we still have the chance, and the way to do that is to vaccinate faster.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11087627/Monkeypox-cases-spreading-region-UK-vaccination-campaign-falters.html,The Daily Mail
New Jersey records first monkeypox case bringing total confirmed in America to 114 across 22 states,Walter Finch For Mailonline,2022-06-21 09:49:00,"New Jersey’s Department of Health said that the first probable case of the virus was confirmed following a test conducted on Saturday.  The monkeypox sample was taken in Jersey City, according to the city's official social media account, and processed at a public health laboratory. It will be sent to the US  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention for confirmation. The case will bring the total number of confirmed cases across America to 114 in 22 states, including the District of Colombia.  'The NJ Health Dept has confirmed the first case of  monkey pox  in Jersey City,' the city's  Instagram  account announced. Our health officials are working closely with the CDC.' The state health department provided further details, confirming it had directed the individual to isolate at home.  'The local health department is conducting contact tracing to identify any individuals who may have been exposed to the individual,' it said. 'Most New Jersey residents are not at risk of infection with monkeypox,' the statement added.  It said no more information will be released due to patient confidentiality.   The CDC stated the US had seen 113 cases by Friday June 17. The New Jersey case will bring the total number of confirmed cases across America to 114 in 22 states Previous 1 Next             The case, if confirmed, will mark New Jersey's first encounter with monkeypox, leaving it far behind California and New York, with 24 cases and 21 cases respectively. Illinois (15) and Florida (10) are also in double figures for the disease, which CDC officials said is being passed on through physical contact with symptomatic patients and by touching their clothing and bedding. Globally, the CDC counts 2,525 total cases across 37 separate countries, with the United Kingdom leading the way with 574 and Spain in second place with 497 confirmed cases of the virus.  Medical literature says that people infected with monkeypox experience flu-like symptoms within the first 21 days of catching the virus, followed by a rash that appears on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But this is rarely being observed in the current outbreak, with patients instead seeing rashes emerge on the genital areas before suffering any flu-like symptoms. Dr Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said: 'The disease is not spread through casual conversations, passing others in a grocery store, or touching things like door-knobs,' she said.  'All of the case we have seen to date in this outbreak have been related to direct contact.' Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Attempting to clear up whether face masks are needed to avoid catching the rash-causing virus, the epidemiologist explained the rash-causing virus would not 'linger in the air' like Covid.  Arizona 1 California 24 Colorado 5 District of Columbia 4 Florida 10 Georgia 3 Hawaii 5 Illinois 15  Maryland 1 Massachusetts 7 Nevada 1 New York 21 Ohio 1 Oklahoma 2 Oregon 1 Pennsylvania 2 Rhode Island 1 Texas 2 Utah 2 Virginia 1 Washington 2  During the conference, health officials also called on Americans with any sexually transmitted infection — including syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia — to get tested for monkeypox.  They warned many patients were experiencing rashes and sores on the genitals and anus that looked like STIs. Several cases of co-infection with monkeypox and a sexually transmitted disease have also been recorded. Health officials also revealed they had distributed more than 1,400 vaccines against the virus to states from their stockpile of more than a million doses. Another 300,000 doses are expected to arrive in the coming weeks. But some experts have raised concerns that the country may not have enough jabs because if the outbreak becomes more widespread there may not be enough to jab the entire country. About three in four cases are currently linked to international travel, including to Europe, while others are linked to someone who has had close contact with a known case. But there are 'several' patients across multiple states who have tested positive despite not recently traveling or having contact with a known case. Dr Jennifer McQuiston, who is leading the CDC's response to the outbreak, said it was likely the case that they acquired the infection from someone who had recently traveled but that this first case was yet to be spotted. She added: 'I can tell you that right now we don't have an area that seems to be having an urban outbreak. There is no one area where it looks like there is a lot of community transmission. 'But this could change. We need to make sure our testing is increasing and ready to catch that when it happens.' Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. It is usually spread through direct contact with animals such as squirrels, which are known to harbour the virus. However, it can also be transmitted through very close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa until now and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. However it can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Monkeypox shuts down some aspects of your body's ability to fight infections. Because of the presence of other viruses and bacteria which your body can't fight off, in the worst cases patients can succumb to a lethal shock throughout the body and blood poisoning. Death is more likely to occur in younger patients. The skin lesions are painful and disfiguring, and can be the source of further infections. Because monkeypox is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. One vaccine, Imvanex, was shown to be around 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox infection. Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10937089/New-Jersey-records-monkeypox-case-taking-total-cases-confirmed-114-20-states.html,The Daily Mail
World Health Organization will rename monkeypox because 'it's RACIST and discriminatory towards Africa',John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-06-15 08:48:00,"Monkeypox will be renamed following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term, it emerged today. The World Health Organization (WHO) promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  It has already swept the world to strike 45 countries, including Britain, the US, Spain and Portugal. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes. World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed they are in conversation with experts on changing the name for monkeypox Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Previous 1 Next                         A group of scientists from around the world have said the current naming of monkeypox and its clades (different types of the virus) is inaccurate, discriminatory and stigmatising. They say references to West African and Central African monkeypox do not accurately reflect the current monkeypox outbreak sweeping the world. Instead, they suggest ditching terms tied to geography, a move the World Health Organization (WHO) has broadly supported. The scientists have suggested monkeypox in general should now be renamed to MPXV. A number at the end of MPXV would indicate the particular clade of the virus. MPXV1 would indicate Central African monkeypox. MPXV2 for the West African version. And MPXV3 would be term for an offshoot of the West African responsible for pervious and current international outbreaks. But the the scientists add the current outbreak and its sustained human-to-human transmission deserves its own clade.  This would be called hMPXV with letters indicating distinct genetic lineages. With pervious international human-to-human monkeypox outbreaks in 2017-2019 with their own distinct ancestry this would mean the current outbreak would be called hMPXVB.1. While the WHO has said it supports renaming monkeypox, the formal naming of viruses is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses. This international committee of virologists would need to accept any new name for monkeypox for it to become official.   'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.' Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958.  Its naming system currently divides it into two types, the West African version and Central African or Congo Basin version. But experts want them to be replaced with numbers, like MPXV1, MPXV2 and so forth. Naming viruses geographically goes against WHO guidelines because of concerns it may spark abusive backlash or potential racism. It is, for this reason, that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) was not called the Wuhan coronavirus, despite originating in the Chinese city of the same name. Writing in a paper published last week, the coalition of infectious disease researchers from around the world also proposed creating a new 'clade' for the current outbreak. They argue the virus circulating at present has become a distinct 'human virus', compared to MPXV, which rarely transmitted between people. The new type, the experts claimed, should be called hMPXV and lineages should be referred to as A, A.1, A.1.1, B.1. They gave four examples because of data showing the West African strain has evolved slightly, based on samples collected in small human-to-human outbreaks over the past few years. The naming system would be similar system to that used for Covid variants like Omicron, with Britain hit by a wave of BA.2 and now experiencing an uptick in cases of BA.4 and BA.5. One benefit of ditching geographic terms would be encouraging countries to continue monitoring for and raising the alarm when spotting new diseases, rather than having their name negatively attached to it, the scientists said. The responsibility of renaming monkeypox actually lies with the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a committee tasked with formally labelling pathogens. It is not the first time concerns about monkeypox and racism have been raised. Last month the Foreign Press Association, Africa, a media body for journalists on the continent, urged Western media to stop using photos of black people alongside monkeypox stories describing the outbreak in Europe and North America. They accused such outlets of perpetuating 'negative stereotypes that assigns calamity to the African race and privilege of immunity to other races.'  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  Calls to rename monkeypox because of concerns of racism and discrimination echo those regarding some people calling Covid the 'Chinese virus' such as former US President Donald Trump (pictured here at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting last month) Mr Trump was widely condemned over statements referring to Covid as the 'Chinese violence' with some studies finding it increased anti-Asian comments on social media  Global Pride events are an opportunity to spread public health messages about monkeypox and must not be cancelled, an expert has told a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing. Steve Taylor, board member at EuroPride, said the virus – which has been mainly concentrated in gay and bisexual men – must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ events. Mr Taylor told the briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. 'We have been working with WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations and event producers across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves. 'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, was asked why cases have been predominantly in the men who have sex with men. She said: 'All outbreaks start somewhere… this virus doesn’t choose any one person against another, it’s opportunistic in its spread. 'And how it will spread will really be defined by the opportunities it has. 'It’s also a disease that has an incubation period of 21 days. We’re just over a month into this outbreak, understanding that outbreak, so it’s too early to conclude as to how it will be spreading amongst the general population.' They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  The current term monkeypox is already somewhat misleading as while the virus was first discovered in macaques, many cases are believed to be transmitted to humans by rodents. A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections. With milder strains, the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. Dr Ghebreyesus said that 1,600 confirmed monkeypox cases and 1,500 suspected cases have been reported to the WHO this year from 39 countries, 32 of which have been recently hit by the virus.  But other experts tracking the outbreak say at least 45 nations have logged cases or suspected cases.  While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected countries, Dr Tedros said. However, he added that the WHO is seeking to verify news reports from Brazil of a monkeypox-related death there. The UN agency will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid. Officials are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe too unless it is stamped out soon. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses have logged 524 cases in Britain. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10918619/World-Health-Organization-rename-monkeypox-scientists-claimed-RACIST.html,The Daily Mail
"Chicago urges people who 'feel sick' or have rashes NOT to attend summer festivals after one of its eight monkeypox cases is linked back to annual fetish gathering, Mr Leather: National tally rises to 72 infections",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-15 15:05:00,"People who 'feel sick' or have rashes should not attend summer parties or festivals in case they have  monkeypox , health chiefs in  Chicago  have warned.  The city's Department of Public Health insisted it gave the warning to ensure residents could make 'informed choices' about gathering in places where the tropical disease could spread. Chicago's monkeypox tally doubled to eight this weekend, with at least one case linked back to the annual fetish festival Mr Leather which took place last month. It is thought to be the first city to issue the warning, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) also warned people who were ill or had rashes to stay away from others earlier this month. America recorded another seven monkeypox cases yesterday bringing its tally to a total of 72 infections. Four of the new cases were in New York City, while one each was in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. It was not clear where the seventh was recorded. Globally, more than 1,800 cases of the rash-causing virus have been detected in at least 45 countries outside of West Africa — where it is native. It comes as the World Health Organization says it will rename the illness because its name is 'racist and discriminatory towards Africa'.

'If someone feels sick or has rashes or sores, [we] recommend not attending a gathering and visiting a healthcare provider as soon as possible.' Dr Allison Arwady, its commissioner, added: 'While the risk in Chicago remains low, [we] want the public to be able to make informed choices about gathering in spaces or participating in events where monkeypox could be spread through intimate contact.' Monkeypox primarily spreads through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions or sores on infected patients. But in rare cases it can also be passed on through the air when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. People can only transmit the virus when they have symptoms, unlike with Covid where people can infect others before they show signs of having the virus. On Monday, America recorded its biggest day-on-day rise in infections since the outbreak began. New York City health chiefs are yet to give any details on their new cases to 'protect individuals privacy'. In Massachusetts, health officials said their case was in a man who is currently isolating. They did not say whether the individual was a close contact of another case or had recently returned from abroad. But on Monday a scientist in the state warned that monkeypox was likely already spreading under the radar in the state. Pennsylvania also did not release any details about its new case citing 'privacy' issues. One expert has warned the U.S. may already have more than 300 cases of the rash-causing virus, but that these have been missed due to testing problems and because the disease may be being mis-diagnosed as others. Medical literature says that in the early stages of infection someone may experience flu-like symptoms before developing a rash on the face around three days later. But the CDC says many patients are experiencing rashes in the genital area and around the anus first. In some cases, they are also not developing any flu-like symptoms. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Most cases in America's outbreak have been detected among gay and bisexual men with links to international travel. But a growing number are being detected in close contacts of people these individuals mixed with before testing positive. There are also at least two cases with no links to known cases or international travel which suggests the disease may be spreading under the radar in the country.

Dutch child under 10 is infected with monkeypox after family holiday in Turkey and suffers 20 lesions all over body but no fever,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-22 22:35:00,"A  Dutch  child under the age of ten has tested positive for  monkeypox  after a family holiday to Turkey - the first confirmed pediatric case as part of the current outbreak of the tropical virus.  The unnamed youngster was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes. Doctors counted 20 lesions over his face, ear, forearms, thighs and back, but the patient did not have a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, and he made a full recovery. None of his close contacts tested positive for monkeypox. It is not clear how he became infected, but testing has ruled out it being down to sexual abuse. The family-of-five said they had no close contact with other guests while on holiday and put their own towels on chairs and loungers. His parents, one of his siblings and a friend — who were all considered high-risk — were vaccinated with the Jynneous jab, which is being used in America.  The report comes as the United States confirms its first two cases of the tropical virus stateside, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The youngster — who has not been named — was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes (pictured is one of the first on his jaw) More than 20 rashes erupted over his body, they said Pictured above is one of the rashes that appeared on his arm  Doctors at the Dutch hospital revealed the diagnosis Thursday in the journal  Eurosurveillance . Dr Marceline van Furth, who led the investigation, said they were publicizing the case to 'raise awareness... that monkeypox can develop in children'. They warned that children — alongside older adults and pregnant women — are more vulnerable to monkeypox, with about three percent dying form the infection. Previous 1 Next             More than 16,000 cases have been detected globally in the current outbreak, mostly among gay or bisexual men who caught the disease through sexual contact. Experts fear the disease has likely already spilled over into other populations, but has not been detected yet because of a lack of testing. Monkeypox does not require sexual contact to spread, and is mainly transmitted via close physical contact or scabs that get stuck on towels or bedding. In rare cases it can also be passed on through the air. America has detected 2,500 cases in the current outbreak — the second highest tally in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. The Netherlands has spotted 700, while Turkey has detected a single case. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  The Dutch monkeypox patient first realized he was unwell shortly after returning from Turkey, when he noticed two small red skin lesions on his left cheek and jaw. His doctor initially diagnosed mild dermatomycosis — medical term for a fungal infection — and prescribed anti-fungal cream. But when more lesions appeared the medic feared he had impetigo — a bacterial infection that causes lesions on the body — and gave him antibiotics. When they continued to crop up over his ear, forearm, thighs and back the boy was referred to hospital with a suspected case of monkeypox — with swabs at the hospital being  positive. His parents and two siblings were then also tested for the virus, but all returned negative results. Dutch health authorities vaccinated both parents, one sibling and a friend who were deemed to be at 'high risk' of being infected. None later developed the virus. An investigation was launched to establish where the child caught the disease, but it was inconclusive. There was no evidence that the child had been near a suspected or confirmed case of monkeypox before catching the disease. The parents also said they had taken care while on holiday to use their own towels and had not had close contact with other guests, limiting the risk of transmission. Analyses revealed the strain the boy caught was the same as the one circulating in Europe's current outbreak. In the paper, the medics wrote: 'As no plausible source could be identified, this leaves us with an open question regarding transmission. 'In the current outbreak, the predominant route of transmission is related to sexual activity in the community of men who have sex with men. 'However, other indirect transmission routes have been described, such as respiratory transmission through droplets or contaminated materials such as bedding and towels. 'Therefore, it is possible that the child was in close contact with an infectious person or contaminated object that was not recognized as such.' They said it typically takes about eight-and-a-half days for someone infected with monkeypox to start showing symptoms. But suggested it was likely longer — up to 21 days — for the boy because the route of transmission was different. He had traveled to Turkey three weeks before symptoms began to appear. His parents said the boy had chickenpox when he was five years old.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11040533/Child-catches-Monkeypox-Boy-10-years-old-infected-disease-Netherlands.html,The Daily Mail
Chicago to put ‘special emphasis’ on warning Pride attendees over monkeypox cases this weekend as US infection tally hits 156,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-23 15:43:00,"Chicago  will put a 'special emphasis' on warning Pride attendees of the risks of catching  monkeypox  this weekend, while San Francisco's parade will be punctuated by regular announcements over the disease amid fears the events could spark an uptick in cases. The Windy City's Department of Public Health told DailyMail.com they would put out guidance on social media and print fliers to be handed out at events. In San Francisco,  California , which is also due to host a parade this Sunday, announcements will be made on 'best practice' when in crowds. America is gearing up to celebrate Pride this weekend in major cities —  with crowds expected to exceed two million in New York alone. But it comes amid a growing outbreak of the rash-causing virus with 156 cases detected so far, many among gay and bisexual men, but no deaths. Several cases are not linked to international travel or other known infections suggesting it is already spreading undetected. Although several cities are putting out warnings at Pride events, the national hotspot New York with 28 cases is yet to announce any plans to follow suit. Last weekend doctors in Florida warned Pride attendees to avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact with others in clubs and bars in order to limit their exposure.  The above map shows states that have detected cases of monkeypox, and the tally by state. The red numbers show the change in cases over the last 24 hours Previous 1 Next             The Biden administration has started shipping monkeypox tests to commercial laboratories, in a bid to speed diagnoses for suspected infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' A spokesman for Chicago's Department of Public Health (CDPH) said: 'We will... continue to share facts about monkeypox and how to stay healthy on our social media channels throughout this weekend, with special emphasis on Pride-related events for the many people who will be taking part. 'In addition, CDPH is printing palmcards with a link to a CDC page that provides health tips for gay and bisexual men and a scannable smartphone code for organizers to hand out at events where participants can get additional tips about remaining healthy.' They added that the department had already created a template letter for event organizers to hand out on how to stay safe against monkeypox. Chicago is expecting more than 100,000 people to flock to its Pride parade this Sunday. San Francisco — which is set to host more than 500,000 people for its own parade — is also planning to put out warnings over monkeypox. Its Pride organizers told DailyMail.com: 'The Department of Health will be making public service announcements specific to monkeypox with best practices. '[This will be] as people gather, and together we are taking every precaution to ensure we are all able to have a safe and fun time during this year’s Pride celebrations.' But New York City health officials — who could be hosting as many as two million people this weekend — are yet to announce any plans to warn people over monkeypox. When contacted, the city's Department of Health directed DailyMail.com to a guidance page on its website. This told people who felt unwell to avoid 'clubs, parties or gatherings', and not to have sex or close physical contact if they or their partner are sick. Monkeypox — native to West Africa — has now been detected more than 3,000 times across 40 countries where it is not typically found.  No deaths have been recorded, but health officials warn it could spill over into more vulnerable populations if the outbreak is not contained. The doctors warned people to avoid skin-to-skin contact that is prolonged during a briefing yesterday. Pictured above from left to right is Dr Margaret Gorensek, an infectious disease expert at Holy Cross Medical Group, Dr Zachary Henry, a sexual health expert at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and Dr Frank Vittimberga, the chief medical officer for the Florida Medical Center The tropical disease is primarily spread through physical contact with infectious rashes, but in rare cases it can also be transmitted through 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Many patients have rashes on their genital area and anus as a first warning sign, before the disease spreads to the rest of the body. It can take up to four weeks to get better from the disease, with most cases being mild and clearing up on their own. Someone remains infectious until their rashes have scabbed over and eventually fallen off. Last week doctors in Florida said Pride attendees should avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact in clubs and bars in order not to catch monkeypox. Speaking at a briefing ahead of celebrations in Fort Lauderdale, Dr Zachary Henry — who spotted a case of monkeypox in his clinic — also warned people to stay away from others with unusual rashes. The sexual health expert at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation added there was no need to wear face masks because the tropical disease took 'hours' to spread through the air between people.  Henry — appearing with Dr Margaret Gorensek — was speaking ahead of a Pride march in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last Saturday which could draw more than 100,000 spectators. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10945799/Chicago-special-emphasis-warning-Pride-attendees-monkeypox-cases.html,The Daily Mail
Brazilians have started poisoning MONKEYS over misplaced fears that they are to blame for growing monkeypox outbreak,Chris Jewers For Mailonline,2022-08-10 12:55:00,"Brazilians have started poisoning monkeys over misplaced fears they are to blame for the growing  monkeypox  virus outbreak. At least 10 monkeys had been poisoned in less than a week in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, in Sao Paulo state, local reports said. Similar incidents were reported in other cities, prompting the World Health Organisation on Tuesday to urge people not to kill the animals over the virus. 'People have to know that the transmission we see now is among humans,' said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, during a press conference in Geneva. Brazil counts more than 1,700 cases of monkeypox, according to the WHO. The country's health ministry confirmed one death related to the disease on July 29 - a man who had low immunity and comorbidities. Contagion can take place from animals to humans, but the recent outbreak is related to human only contacts, Harris said. Brazilians have started poisoning monkeys over misplaced fears they are to blame for the growing monkeypox outbreak. Brazilian news website G1 reported on Sunday that 10 monkeys had been poisoned in less than a week in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, in Sao Paulo state. Similar incidents were reported in other cities. Pictured: A monkey is seen in Brazil (file photo) 'People certainly should not attack the animals,' she said. 'The transmission we are seeing now with the large outbreak of monkeypox is the person-to-person transmission. 'The virus is in some animals, and we see a jump in humans, but that's not what we're seeing now. The risk of transmission comes from another human being.' Harris stressed that the concern should instead be about where the virus is circulating in populations, and the steps people can take to protect themselves.  The best way to tackle the virus, Harris said, is for 'people [to] recognise they have symptoms and go get help and medical care and take precautions to prevent it being transmitted'. Raising awareness among at-risk groups is key to this, she said. The virus spreads through close contact, and most cases so far have been registered among men who have sex with men. The WHO has urged people not to stigmatise any people who are infected. Previous 1 Next             'Any stigmatisation of any person infected is going to increase the transmission, because if people are afraid of identifying themselves as being infected, then they will not get care and will not take precautions,' Harris said,  the Guardian reported . 'So do not stigmatise any animal or any human, because if you do do that, we will have a much larger outbreak,' she added. Brazil has a long register of attacks on monkeys during yellow fever outbreaks too. Since May, nearly 90 countries have reported more than 29,000 cases of monkeypox. The WHO classified the outbreak of the once-rare disease as an international emergency in July. Monkeypox is usually a mild to moderate infection that leads to flu-like symptoms and characteristic pus-filled skin lesions. The viral disease has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades, and was first reported this year outside those countries in May. The World Health Organization expressed sorrow on Tuesday for the killing of the animals in Brazil amid growing fears of contagion, and stressed that monkeys are not spreading the virus. Pictured: Vials of Imvanex, a vaccine to protect against Monkeypox, are seen in France Health officials in Europe are currently discussing whether to follow a move by the United States to stretch out scarce monkeypox vaccine supplies, with the World Health Organization calling for more data. There have been 27,800 monkeypox cases - largely among men who have sex with men - and 12 deaths worldwide this year. Supplies of the key Bavarian Nordic shot, the only vaccine authorized to prevent monkeypox and a key part of the global public health response, are scarce, according to WHO and other government health agencies. On Tuesday, the U.S. backed using one vial of the vaccine to administer up to five separate doses - instead of a single dose - by injecting a smaller amount in between layers of the skin.  The vaccine was designed to be injected into a layer of fat beneath the skin. This so-called 'dose-sparing' approach has been tried before with other vaccines, including for polio and yellow fever, but evidence is limited on whether it could work for monkeypox. 'The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will discuss the possibility of a dose-sparing approach,' an EMA spokesperson told Reuters, adding the regulator would discuss the strategy with the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, and European countries. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The WHO 'encourages the use of vaccines within trials that will help to gather relevant information for their use in this outbreak,' a spokesperson told Reuters by email. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, data collected in a 2015 clinical study demonstrated that dose-sparing could work without sacrificing the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Meanwhile, some governments in Europe are taking other steps to extend existing supplies. For instance, Britain is offering just one shot of the two-dose regimen to people most at risk as a temporary measure to afford at least some protection to a greater number of people. It is unclear whether either approach will result in adequate protection against monkeypox. Since May, nearly 90 countries have reported more than 29,000 cases of monkeypox. The WHO classified the outbreak of the once-rare disease as an international emergency in July  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Friday there were 'early signs' that the monkeypox outbreak is plateauing across the country and that its expansion has slowed. 'While the most recent data suggests the growth of the outbreak has slowed, we cannot be complacent,' Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said. There were 2,859 confirmed and highly probable cases of monkeypox in the UK as of Aug. 4, with nearly 99% of the cases among men, the country's health authority said in a statement. The recent analysis by the UKHSA showed that 'monkeypox continues to be transmitted primarily in interconnected sexual networks of gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men', it added. British authorities in June were recommending gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered a vaccine, as the outbreak of the viral disease had gathered pace, mostly in Europe. Individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox are being offered the smallpox vaccine, Dr Chand said. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11098669/Brazilians-poisoning-MONKEYS-misplaced-fears-blame-monkeypox-outbreak.html,The Daily Mail
"Avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact in clubs and bars this Pride because of monkeypox, Florida doctors say ahead of parade this weekend: US tally hits triple-figures with another 16 cases recorded in 24-hours",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-17 16:36:00,"Americans should avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact in clubs and bars in order to avoid catching  monkeypox  this Pride doctors in  Florida  warned Thursday, as the U.S. infection tally surged into triple-figures. Speaking at a briefing, Dr Zachary Henry — who spotted a case of monkeypox in his clinic — also warned people to stay away from others with unusual rashes. The sexual health expert at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation added there was no need to wear face masks because the tropical disease took 'hours' to spread through the air between people. Scientists say monkeypox spreads through touching infectious lesions on patients. They may be anywhere on the body — including the face, arms and genitals. It can also be passed through the air during sustained face-to-face contact. Henry — appearing with Dr Margaret Gorensek — was speaking ahead of a Pride march in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this Saturday which could draw more than 100,000 spectators. Most states such as New York and Chicago, Illinois, will hold their celebrations next weekend. Both experts warned monkeypox was likely already spreading undetected in Florida, after a scientist said earlier this week it was also transmitting under the radar in Massachusetts. America has recorded 100 cases of monkeypox so far, with Maryland and Oregon now being the twentieth and twenty-first states to spot the rash-causing virus. Globally more than 1,000 infections have been detected across 35 nations in the 'biggest outbreak' outside of Africa — where it is native — to date. But no deaths have been registered yet. America's monkeypox cases tally has now hit 100. The table on the left shows the number of cases in each state, and the number of infections recorded per state over the last 24 hours. Maryland and Oregon today recorded their first cases of the virus The doctors warned people to avoid skin-to-skin contact that is prolonged during a briefing yesterday. Pictured above from left to right is Dr Margaret Gorensek, an infectious disease expert at Holy Cross Medical Group, Dr Zachary Henry, a sexual health expert at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and Dr Frank Vittimberga, the chief medical officer for the Florida Medical Center Organizers of the Pride parade in Fort Lauderdale say it is expected to attract up to 100,000 people. Pictured above is a previous parade in the city  Speaking at the town hall on monkeypox, Henry said: 'Going out at Pride, going to the stores, the restaurants, the bars — if you are avoiding prolonged skin-to-skin contact that should be safe. 'The only other method of transmitting monkeypox is through respiratory droplets, but that's rare. 'If you are not touching someone, you would need to be indoors without a mask for several hours — if not more — to catch it. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  'So you can go outside at the Parade, don't be afraid to go for pubs and bars but watch for the rashes and look at what is on their body.' He added: 'Essentially you don't want prolonged skin-to-skin contact with someone who has that rash. 'For people who might recreationally enjoy dark rooms or commercial sex clubs where you can't see what's on the person's body — now is not the time to be there.' Gorensek, an infectious disease specialist from the state's Holy Cross Medical Group, warned people to 'minimize' skin-to-skin contact.  'There would be less risk going to concerts and gatherings — that is not high risk,' she said. 'But skin-to-skin contact puts you more in that category. 'We don't have a high number of cases [in Florida] but we can get to that point.' Zachary explained the monkeypox patient he treated had started developing rashes about a day after having sex with another individual. He said this suggested that the case had been infected before having sex with that person by another, as yet un-identified, person. The person he had sex with was also now likely infected. Columbus in Ohio and Portland in Oregon — which have each detected one monkeypox case — are also due to hold Pride parades this weekend. But neither has issued any guidance on how to stay safe from the tropical disease during the celebrations. The organizers of New York City pride — which attracts up to two million people and is the largest in America —  have, however, issued guidance on how to protect yourself against the disease. In an Instagram post on Monday they called on anyone with a rash who did not feel unwell not to attend events.  They also said anyone experiencing a fever, headache or swollen glands should contact their health provider for testing.  They said: 'The risk to most people still remains low, but knowledge empowers our community to protect its health.' Chicago also warned people who did not feel well or had an unusual rash to stay away from summer parties and festivals this week. America has now recorded 100 cases of monkeypox across 21 states with the most in California, New York and Illinois. Many infections are among gay and bisexual men and linked back to international travel. But a growing number are among people with no links to foreign travel or another known case — suggesting the virus is spreading in the country under the radar. New York City Pride organizers have also issued guidance for people looking to attend the parades. They call on those with a rash or who feel unwell to 'stay away' It comes after DailyMail.com revealed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had published bizarre guidance on how to have sex while infected with monkeypox. It states that anyone who is infected with the disease should not have sex. But for those who ignore the advice, it has published a list of the dos and donts under the bedsheets. Among its tips was to masturbate at least six feet away from your partner and also to have sex while still fully-clothed ensuring all rashes are covered. Other advice was to avoid kissing, wash hands, fetish gear and clothes immediately afterwards and even to consider having sex virtually such as over the phone. People catch monkeypox by touching infectious skin lesions, but it can also be spread through the air during 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It can take up to four weeks for anyone infected with monkeypox to recover from the disease, with about eight days needed from infection for symptoms to appear.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10927345/Avoid-prolonged-skin-skin-contact-clubs-Pride-monkeypox-Florida-docs-say.html,The Daily Mail
America recorded 16 monkeypox cases last weekend bringing total to 65 as outbreak hits seventeenth state Ohio,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-14 15:54:00,"Another 16  monkeypox  cases were spotted across the United States this weekend, bringing the total number of cases of the rare disease to 65. Health officials revealed the updated tally Tuesday, covering the period from Friday evening up to 2 p.m. Monday. Infections were reported in six states, with the most in national hotspot  California  - which saw its tally rise by five to 15 patients. Over the last three days  Ohio  also detected its first case of monkeypox, although no details were given to protect the patient's privacy.  Chicago's case count doubled to eight patients, with at least one case in Illinois' largest city linked to annual fetish conference Mr Leather that took place last month. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials are scrambling to contain the outbreak before the tropical disease gains a foothold in the U.S. But Monday a scientist warned there may already be 'undetected transmission chains' in Massachusetts after the state spotted two cases that were not linked to another known infection. Globally, more than 1,600 cases have been detected across more than four dozen countries outside of its native West Africa — with most in the UK (470), Spain (307) and Portugal (209). Previous 1 Next             Monkeypox could be spread through semen, scientists say. Medical literature says the disease is transmitted primarily through touching infectious skin lesions on patients. In limited cases it may also be passed on through the air if someone has 'sustained' face-to-face contact with an infected person. But now scientists in Italy say they have detected fragments of the virus in the semen of a handful of patients, suggesting it could also be transmitted through this route. Researchers at the Spallanzani Institute, in Rome, said six out of seven patients they checked had semen containing genes from the virus. In one sample there was enough virus to suggest it could infect another patient. Dr Francesco Vaia, its director general, said: 'Having an infectious virus in semen is a factor that tips the balance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that sexual transmission is one of the ways in which this virus is transmitted.' Today's cases update is the biggest surge for a three-day period so far, up 160 percent from the six registered the weekend before. Hawaii also reported another two cases after officials there warned the rash-causing virus was likely spreading 'in our community'. There was one case in Colorado, Georgia and Ohio each. Health officials in Ohio refused to give any details about their first case in order to 'protect the patient's privacy'. Most cases in America are being detected among gay and bisexual men and linked to international travel. But a growing number are being spotted in people who had close contact with a known patient, or those who are not close contacts and have not recently traveled. The CDC has so far brushed off concerns about these cases, however, saying they are likely linked to an undiagnosed case in a traveler. It also says America is yet to detect any major outbreaks in urban centers unlike nations struggling against the disease in Europe. Yesterday Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned monkeypox was likely already spreading under the radar in Massachusetts. He told DailyMail.com that the state's latest cases 'certainly indicate undetected transmission chains, although at this stage we can't say whether they are linked to the previous case in Massachusetts or are a separate introduction'. He added: 'I noticed that [Health officials in the state] have urged ""vigilance"". I think it is extremely appropriate. 'People should be aware of the symptoms — fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash — but also remember that the rash might not look like the photos in the papers which tend to be of people suffering from a different strain of the virus, with an extensive disseminated rash.' On Sunday the state reported two cases in men that were close contacts of each other but not linked to its first patient reported about a month ago. Health officials also did not say whether the patients — who were from the Boston area — had recently returned from international travel. In Rhode Island, health officials said their first case — a man in his 30s — was 'believed to be related to travel to Massachusetts'. It is not clear whether he was linked to these latest cases, the first patient or another as yet unidentified transmission chain.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10915367/America-recorded-16-monkeypox-cases-weekend-bringing-total-65.html,The Daily Mail

"Monkeypox could become endemic in US in what would be 'the worst public health failure in modern times' because it could have been prevented, former FDA director Scott Gottlieb says as infections rise to 5,189",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-01 17:25:00,"Monkeypox  becoming endemic in the U.S. would be the 'worst public health failure in modern times' because it could have been prevented, an ex-Food and Drug Administration director has said. Writing in an op-ed over the weekend, Dr Scott Gottlieb pointed out that — unlike when Covid first emerged — there were already reliable vaccines and tests available to stop the disease in its tracks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) failed to act rapidly, instead following the same 'protracted checklist' and making many of the same mistakes as when Covid struck. He wrote in the  New York Times  that should the disease gain a foothold it would be a disaster both because it could have been prevented and as infections — which spark blisters across body — are painful. Many sufferers have said their symptoms were 'worse than Covid'. Last month Gottlieb predicted the tally of cases — then 1,800 — were just a fraction of the actual number. Since then it has risen to more than 5,000 with the CDC now detecting about 250 new infections per day. It is the second time Gottlieb has spoken out over the CDC response. Previously, he warned the slow pace left a risk of the virus becoming endemic in the country Writing in the op-ed, Gottlieb said: 'If monkeypox gains a permanent foothold in the United States and becomes an endemic virus that joins our circulating repertoire of pathogens, it will be one of the worst public health failures in modern times. 'Not only because of the pain and peril of the disease, but also because it was so avoidable.' Previous 1 Next             Indian authorities reported Asia's first possible monkeypox fatality on Monday after the death of a man who recently returned from United Arab Emirates testing positive. Kerala state's health ministry said tests on the 22-year-old 'showed that the man had monkeypox'.   Four monkeypox-related fatalities have so far been reported outside Africa in an outbreak that the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency. The Indian man died in Kerala on July 30 around a week after returning from the UAE and being taken to hospital. It was unclear however whether monkeypox was the cause of death. 'The youth had no symptoms of monkeypox. He had been admitted to a hospital with symptoms of encephalitis and fatigue,' the Indian Express daily quoted Kerala's health minister Veena George as saying on Sunday. The other monkeypox fatalities are: Two in Spain, one in Brazil, one in Ghana, three in Nigeria and two in the Central African Republic.  He added: 'When about 100 cases of monkeypox had been confirmed or suspected in Europe in May, it was clear the virus was spreading outside the areas where it was previously seen. These reports should have been code red for the CDC. 'But it wasn't until late June that the agency expanded testing for monkeypox to large commercial labs like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp for more capacity and access. 'Time is running out. Diseases like Zika, Covid and monkeypox are a dire warning that dangerous pathogens are on the march. 'The next one could be worse — a deadly strain of flu or something more sinister like Marburg virus. 'We've now had ample notice that the nation continues to be unprepared and that our vulnerabilities are enormous.' Gottlieb also called for the CDC to be re-focussed specifically to fighting infectious diseases.  He said cancer and heart disease could be handled by the National Institutes of Health, while smoking could be moved to the Food and Drug Administration. Gottlieb has previously briefed reporters that the window for stopping the disease turning endemic in the U.S. was likely already closing, if not had already closed. He said at the time that the national tally — then-1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the total because of poor testing coverage. Since then, it has risen to more than 5,000 cases. He also warned monkeypox had likely already spread outside of gay or bisexual men, but that this was yet to be detected. Again, it has since been detected in two children — one living in California and the other passing through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman. It came after New York became the first state to declare monkeypox a 'disaster emergency' over the weekend. New York governor Kathy Hochul announced late Friday that monkeypox is now a state disaster emergency as her administration struggles to disperse vaccines to contain the spread. People pictured queuing for the monkeypox vaccine in New York City today Lines forming for getting a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine. Second doses are being delayed due to a lack of jabs available Appointments have been available to sign up to via a link, with more being released by the City's department of health The announcement comes as monkeypox cases rise in New York City, the current US epicenter of the outbreak, where case counts passed 1,400 on Friday. Hochul tweeted: 'I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our ongoing efforts to confront the monkeypox outbreak. 'This Executive Order enables us to respond more swiftly, and allows health care professionals to take additional steps that will help get more New Yorkers vaccinated.' Hochul continued: 'More than one in four monkeypox cases in this country are in New York, currently having a disproportionate impact on at-risk groups. 'We are working around the clock to secure more vaccines, expand testing capacity, and educate New Yorkers on how to stay safe.' Monkeypox is currently hitting gay men the hardest, with an estimated 95 per cent of US infections occurring among them.

"US hits record 1,424 new monkeypox cases in a single day on Monday: Fears grow there may be outbreaks across college campuses as students return to school this month",Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-09 15:37:00,"The U.S. logged a record 1,424  monkeypox  cases on Monday, the highest total since the global outbreak first found its way stateside in May. It comes as officials are starting to raise concerns about the virus running rampant on college campuses during the upcoming semester. Monday's figures bring America's overall case total to 8,934 - putting the U.S. on track to be the first nation to eclipse 9,000 confirmed infection when officials report new figures Tuesday. It is likely that these figures are a severe undercount because of the lack of testing. This outbreak could soon get worse as well. The new school year is set to begin at colleges and universities across the U.S. in the coming weeks. Young students are more likely to engage in careless sexual behavior, creating a perfect storm for potential monkeypox outbreaks around the nation. Unlike Covid in 2020, many universities also do not have dedicated response plans to the virus either - making rampant spread even more likely once the virus is brought onto campus. 'As we head into the fall, I'm concerned about outbreaks on college campuses as they are often a place where individuals engage in higher risk sexual activity and are in close contact with many different people,' Dr Rachel Cox, an assistant professor in at the Mass General Health Institute of Health Professionals, told  CNN .  'We need to make sure we're prepared to allocate resources like tests, vaccines, and antivirals to places that may become hotspots.'  Not all experts believe the outbreak will absolutely spiral out of control, though. Dr Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and current board member at pharma-giant Pfizer, told  CBS' Face the Nation  on Sunday that while difficult, it is possible to prevent monkeypox from becoming an endemic virus - a prospect officials likely failed with Covid. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that America's monkeypox outbreak can still be controlled He says that the response to the virus has to be wider to control it, though. At the moment, testing has mainly been reserved to just gay and bisexual men - who make up a overwhelming majority of cases. Gottlieb believes that more cases would be found if testing was expanded beyond just that community. ‘There’s a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Gottlieb said. 'We’re continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.’ While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that they still make up a majority of cases. America is facing a shortage of both testing and vaccines at the moment, though, meaning that they have been reserved for men who have sex with other men to this point. The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point.  Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained. 'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate. 'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11095563/US-records-record-1-424-new-monkeypox-cases-Monday.html,The Daily Mail
"'Every American should pay attention on monkeypox': Officials warn the virus outbreak will not only affect gay men - as US becomes global hotspot with 4,639 cases",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-28 20:10:00,"Every American should 'pay attention' to the  monkeypox  outbreak because the disease could spill over into more groups than just gay men, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned Thursday — as U.S. cases topped 4,600 to become the highest tally in the world. Dr Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, issued the stark warning during a press briefing, adding that infections with the disease were 'painful' and could also be dangerous. He did insist it was 'absolutely' still possible for the U.S. to eliminate monkeypox. The vast majority of cases are still among gay or bisexual men, but last week America recorded its first two cases in children — in a toddler in  California  and infant traveling through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman who tested positive when she was near full-term. Top experts have been warning for weeks that other groups could catch the disease because it does not require sexual contact to transmit, but only close contact such as hugs or brushing the rashes of an infected person. Becerra's comments came after the U.S. infection tally surged by 1,048 cases on Thursday to become the highest in the world, with officials warning it was set to continue to rise for 'weeks'. California and New York accounted for 75 percent of the rise, which was blamed on 'historic' cases being added to the tally. No deaths have been reported in the U.S. yet, with only one registered in Nigeria so far in this global outbreak of more than 20,000 cases. But there are concerns that should the disease spread to more vulnerable groups — including children and pregnant women — more fatalities will be recorded.  Dr Xevier Becerra, who heads up the Department of Health and Human Services, warned all Americans should be worried about the spread of monkeypox. Captain Jennifer McQuiston, who is involved with the response at the CDC, warned that cases would likely continue to rise for weeks             Lyme vaccine testing begins         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Russian 'holidaymaker' breaks down in tears after fleeing Crimea         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         MailOnline looks at Samsung's new foldable phones and accessories         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey     At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) conference, Becerra warned: 'Every American should pay attention on monkeypox.  'Monkeypox is not Covid, but it is contagious, it is painful and it can be dangerous. At the HHS our goal is — stay ahead of the virus, and to stop the outbreak. We are doing everything we can in that regard.' He added: 'On the question can we not only stay ahead but end this outbreak — absolutely. We believe we have done everything we can at the Federal level [for this].' Previous 1 Next                   A pregnant woman has tested positive for monkeypox in the United States, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief revealed yesterday. The woman has now given birth to her child, who does not appear to have caught the rash-causing virus from the mother. CDC released limited information on the case, including where in the US the woman was based. It's also unclear when the woman was infected, or exactly when she gave birth. Health officials said both were 'doing well', but the nation's top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that pregnant woman may face a 'profound risk' from the virus. A maternity doctor told DailyMail.com that women in the early stages of pregnancy faced the biggest risk from monkeypox. The mother may have been in the final stages of her pregnancy when infected, as she recently gave birth. The newborn received immune globin, an infusion of antibodies capable of fighting diseases including monkeypox, officials said. It is not clear what treatment the mother received. It is the first infection to be detected in a pregnant woman in the United States, and comes after America recorded its first two infections in children last week. The pediatric cases were unrelated and detected in California and Washington D.C. Becerra also called on every American offered the vaccine to get one, pointing out that even with Covid — which may still be more deadly than monkeypox — many Americans have still not got the jab. Nearly 800,000 more doses of the vaccine have arrived in the United States and are now being made available to states, they revealed today. This is more than double the total 338,000 that have been dished out so far. Health officials also say a further 5.5 million are due to arrive by May next year, with another 11.1 million in storage to be called upon if the outbreak worsens. Most states are currently rolling out vaccines to close contacts of reported cases, with New York City and Washington D.C. offering them to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual contacts in a fortnight. Both have cut plans to offer a second dose — usually given 28 days after the first — due to a lack of supply. Yesterday top officials also took to the airwaves to warn men who have sex with men to 'limit' their sexual contacts to help curb the spread of the disease. Dr Jennifer McQuiston, a pathology expert at the CDC, told the briefing almost every monkeypox case had been spotted in a man, with the 'vast majority' saying they had sex with other men. They were aged 35 years on average, with the oldest being 76. About two-fifths of cases were detected among white men, while another two-fifths were in the hispanic population and almost 30 percent were among black individuals. Four percent were Asian. Almost every case has experienced a rash during their infection, with fatigue, fever and swollen lymph nodes making up the rest of the four most common symptoms. No deaths from the disease have been reported in the U.S. to date, but there are mounting fears that it could spill over into more vulnerable groups including children and pregnant women. The disease only requires physical contact to spread — such as cuddles or brushing the arm of an infected person — or can be picked up from scabs from a patient left on bedding. Sexual contact is not necessary. This week the CDC revealed the first two cases in children — in a toddler from California and an infant who was traveling through Washington D.C.. Another infection was also detected in a pregnant woman, although the location has not been disclosed. Health officials say all cases are 'doing well'. But data suggests children under eight years old are at higher risk of severe disease than adults. Pregnant woman are also more at risk, particularly those in the first ten weeks of pregnancy where the disease could lead to abnormalities in organs forming in the baby. Other experts have warned monkeypox has likely already spilled over to other groups, but that this is not being detected yet because officials are doing too few tests. Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the HHS, said there were a further 11.1million doses available to the U.S. in Denmark that were currently in storage. She said these would be deployed with further funding from Congress, and if it was deemed necessary should cases escalate.  Yesterday another 1,048 cases of monkeypox were recorded in the U.S., with McQuiston saying most of this number was 'historic' with infections only now being added to the tally. It makes the U.S. outbreak the largest in the world, with Spain — among the first countries to record cases — behind with 3,738 infections alongside Germany with 2,540. But when the data is looked at in terms of population — which is more accurate because it takes into account country sizes — it shows out of the top ten countries with the highest case tally the U.S. has the eighth largest outbreak. At the top of the table is Spain, with the most cases per resident, followed by Portugal and the Netherlands.              Lyme vaccine testing begins         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Russian 'holidaymaker' breaks down in tears after fleeing Crimea         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         MailOnline looks at Samsung's new foldable phones and accessories         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey    ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11058219/Every-American-pay-attention-monkeypox-HHS-officials-warning.html,The Daily Mail
Indiana and Missouri record first suspected cases of monkeypox as US official infection tally reaches 111,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-20 15:43:00,"Monkeypox  is continuing its spread across the U.S., with  Indiana  and Missouri logging their first potential cases over the weekend - and official figures reach the 111 mark. One case was detected by  Kansas  City, Missouri, health officials on Saturday, with a resident who had recently traveled domestically testing positive for the orthopox family of viruses that includes monkeypox. State health officials in Indiana also revealed they had detected a potential case in an undisclosed part of the state. Samples from both persons will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to confirm if they are monkeypox infections with results expected in the coming days. The Midwest and Great Plains regions of the U.S. had largely been spared from the rare tropical virus so far, with only Ohio and Illinois having recorded cases before the weekend. Though it is possible that the virus has been circulating in the region before these two recent cases were logged and just were not picked up by surveillance. In total, the U.S. has confirmed 111 cases - with neither of the cases in Indiana and Missouri being included in official figures yet - with New York and California suffering the worst outbreaks with nearly two dozen infections each. Just over 2,500 cases have been detected worldwide, with the 574 cases in the UK being the most. No deaths have been tied to the recent monkeypox outbreak in countries where it is not endemic. Cases from Missouri and Indiana have not yet been added to official CDC case figures as federal officials work to confirm them. Over the weekend, the case tally rose from 100 to 111 Previous 1 Next             'This week, one of our excellent nurses suspected one of our patients may have monkeypox virus,' Dr Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department said. 'We are considering this a probable case of monkeypox virus until we receive final confirmation from the CDC labs.'   The case would be the first in the state of Missouri. Neighboring Illinois and Oklahoma has also recorded cases of monkeypox during this outbreak. If the cases in Missouri and Indiana are confirmed then it would bring America's infection count to 113. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  Officials in both states are also undergoing contact tracing measures to notify others who have may been exposed to the virus. While the exact symptoms being faced by each infected person has not been revealed, the CDC warns that common symptoms include rashes, blisters on the hands, feet, arms, genitals and other areas of the body, muscle aches and fatigue among others. The agency also warns that many may mistake the pox that come as part of the infection - the most obvious sign a person has contracted the virus - with STIs like syphilis. Monkeypox usually spreads by body-to-body contact with the infectious lesions on a person's body, though it can also be transmitted through sustained face-to-face contact. Patients are expected to first experience a fever within three weeks, followed by a rash that covers the face, and then the rest of the body. Last week, the CDC warned that many patients were not experiencing the typical symptoms. The agency reports that many were developing the rashes before fevers, with some never experiencing a fever at all. Rashes were being recorded in the mouth and genital area or anus, which has not previously been associated with the illness. The patterns of lesions appearing around the body were not consistent either. Almost all cases in the U.S. have been tied to international travel, either to an African nation where the virus is endemic or to a European country that has experienced significant spread. Some cases have no links to travel, though, indicating multiple examples of human-to-human transmission on U.S. soil. Gay and bisexual men in particular have suffered the largest burden of infections, with the virus believed to be spreading through the sexual network. Outbreaks have been tied to wo sex-raves in Belgium and Spain, and a recent Mr Leather fetish event in Chicago, Illinois, is believed to be at the center of another cluster of cases.  This has left some worried that Pride parades this June will be sources of rampant monkeypox spread. Doctors and community leaders are encouraging people to still attend these events, but to take precautions. Speaking at the town hall on monkeypox, Henry said: 'Going out at Pride, going to the stores, the restaurants, the bars — if you are avoiding prolonged skin-to-skin contact that should be safe. 'The only other method of transmitting monkeypox is through respiratory droplets, but that's rare. 'If you are not touching someone, you would need to be indoors without a mask for several hours — if not more — to catch it. 'So you can go outside at the Parade, don't be afraid to go for pubs and bars but watch for the rashes and look at what is on their body.' He added: 'Essentially you don't want prolonged skin-to-skin contact with someone who has that rash. 'For people who might recreationally enjoy dark rooms or commercial sex clubs where you can't see what's on the person's body — now is not the time to be there.' Gorensek, an infectious disease specialist from the state's Holy Cross Medical Group, warned people to 'minimize' skin-to-skin contact. 'There would be less risk going to concerts and gatherings — that is not high risk,' she said. 'But skin-to-skin contact puts you more in that category.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10934743/Indiana-Missouri-record-presumptive-cases-monkeypox.html,The Daily Mail
"Glastonbury is finally back! After THREE YEARS of Covid cancellations, tens of thousands party into the night joined by dozens of A-list celebs as Billie Eilish slams US abortion ruling on stage at Britain's biggest festival",Adam Solomons For Mailonline,2022-06-25 09:45:00,"Glastonbury made a glorious return after three years as revellers resisted nationwide rail strikes and thunderstorm fears to bury memories of Covid at the world's most iconic music festival. An estimated 200,000 music fans flocked to Worthy Farm, east Somerset for the 37th iteration of Glasto, which is also the world's biggest outdoor festival. For the first time ever Glastonbury's festivities started as early as Thursday, with thousands setting up camp by Tuesday. Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is set to speak to a huge crowd from the Pyramid Stage at 5.15pm today ahead of a set by Californian female rock group Haim. Thunberg tweeted two pictures from the Somerset campsite, stating she was 'excited' to make the 'special appearance'.  This year's music headliners include  Paul McCartney , Kendrick Lamar and  Billie Eilish , who in her explosive Pyramid Stage set last night slammed the US  Supreme Court 's abortion rights overhaul. Eilish, 20, last night made history as the youngest ever star to headline Glastonbury. She delivered a stellar medley of hits alongside big brother Finneas in an edgy look that consisted of an oversized T-shirt and matching shorts for tens of thousands of waiting fans.  Taking to the stage, she said it was a  'dark day for women' following the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe V Wade, as she took to the stage at the Glastonbury Festival on Friday. The singer, 20, who first made her debut at the festival on The Other Stage at Worthy Farm in 2019, told the crowd she 'couldn't bear to think about' the ruling which ended the constitutional right to abortion in the US, meaning individual states could decide whether abortion can be made illegal. Also prominent at the festival were many   - a nod to the PM's claim that lockdown-busting gatherings were not parties.   And Sir Paul McCartney last night prepared for Glastonbury, one of the biggest gigs of his career, by playing one of the smallest. Sir Paul, 80, delivered a preview of his Glastonbury set to an audience of around 800 at the Cheese and Grain – a not-for-profit venue in a former agricultural warehouse in the town of Frome in Somerset. Fans had scrambled to pick up tickets in person after the secret gig was announced at 5pm on Thursday.

Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, 19, is set to make a 'special appearance' at Glastonbury tonight. The teen will address a crowd of tens of thousands from the Pyramid Stage at 5.15pm before female rock group Haim performs. Thunberg has continued to host regular school strikes in her native Sweden. It wasn't immediately clear how she made it to the UK. Adopting an English accent, she added: 'How are you doin?' Paul McCartney will play tonight's coveted Saturday night set, with US rapper Kendrick Lamar closing out the festival tomorrow evening. Showers hit the festival yesterday morning - and there are fears of heavy rain tomorrow and showers on Sunday afternoon. And celebrities weren't just spotted on stage, either. A-listers including Kate Moss, Games of Thrones actors Kit Harington and his wife Rose Leslie, model Daisy Lowe and Love Island host Laura Whitmore were among the VIPs pictured yesterday at Worthy Farm. Some revellers were pictured waving Partygate-themed flags ribbing Boris Johnson at the music festival. Several flags read 'this is a work event' - a nod to the PM's claim that lockdown-busting gatherings were not parties.  It comes after Mr Johnson suffered two damaging defeats in the Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton by-elections.

'Showers will ease into Friday night and the band of rain will continue north-eastwards bringing some heavy bursts of rain at times.'

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said this may be because the event has gone largely cashless and attendees are paying using their phones. As of 11am today, 11 offences had been recorded since the gates of Glastonbury opened early on Wednesday morning, ending a three-year hiatus for the Somerset festival. Those offences included four incidents of theft, four drug-related offences, one incident of common assault, one incident of criminal damage and one incident of public disorder. One of the drug-related offences resulted in an arrest. Ms Ayres said some 'could be locally heavy with a risk of local thunderstorms, especially in the south west, therefore risk of some heavy showers for Glastonbury.' Northern Ireland and parts of western Scotland could see some longer spells of rain, with heavy bursts, while the north and west could experience strong winds with a risk of coastal gales. For Sunday, Ms Ayres said: 'Cloudy with outbreaks of rain in the northwest, this becoming more showery later on. Elsewhere a mixture of sunny spells and scattered showers, some showers for Glastonbury into the afternoon, these heaviest in the south west.' Strong winds continue in the north and west with a risk of coastal gales, mainly Northern Ireland, Wales and western Scotland, while it will be breezy elsewhere. It comes as Billie Eilish will make history when she takes to the Pyramid Stage tonight as Glastonbury Festival's youngest ever solo headliner. The weather is set to be dry during her performance, despite the high chance of showers throughout the afternoon. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: 'It's going to be a fairly cloudy start to the morning.  'There is going to be a few showers around but on the light side generally, so a bit of a cloudy, damp start to the day but quite a warm start with temperatures around 16C (61F). It does look like it will get drier and brighter as the morning goes on. 'There will be a few glimmers of sunshine by the early afternoon but then it looks like into the early evening there is a band of rain that is coming from the west so around 4pm there will be some showery rain that will push eastwards across Glastonbury - but it should clear around about 7pm.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has addressed the crowd at Glastonbury festival with a video message which was played on the big screens at the Other Stage today. He said: 'Greetings Glastonbury. The festival resumes this year after a two-year break, the pandemic has put on hold lives of the millions of people around the world, but has not broken. We in Ukraine would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace. 'But we will not let Russia's war break us, we want to stop the war before it ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America - they are all under threat now. That is why I turn to you for support Glastonbury the greatest concentration of freedom these days and I ask you to share this feeling with everyone who's freedom is under attack. 'Spread the truth about Russia's war, help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of the war, find our United24 charity platform and put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine. 'Time is priceless and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia's war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins! Slava Ukraine.' The message was played ahead of The Libertines stage-opening set. Grammy-winning singer Eilish, 20, will perform alongside her brother and co-writer, Finneas O'Connell. The US pop star made her Glastonbury debut in 2019 when she performed on the Other Stage and treated crowds to a string of tracks such as Bad Guy and You Should See Me In A Crown. In the weeks leading up to Glastonbury, Eilish has played a string of UK and European tour dates and also hosted a climate event, Overheated, at London's O2 Arena. She also topped the bill at Coachella in the US in April, bringing out guests Khalid and Damon Albarn for a set that thrilled fans and reviewers. Eilish's mother, Maggie Baird, said her daughter's history-making set at Glastonbury is 'definitely amazing but very hard to process at the same time'. Baird, an actor, screenwriter and former theatre troupe teacher, told The Guardian: 'It's a very pinch-me moment. People always ask 'How do you feel on this momentous day?' But, as a parent, everything your kid does from the beginning is kind of amazing. 'I was blown away when she was playing the little club in our tiny area of Highland Park (in Los Angeles). It just stays mind-blowing.' On the day Eilish headlines Glastonbury, Sir Paul McCartney will be warming up for his headline slot tomorrow by performing at a Somerset music venue. The surprise gig at the Cheese & Grain entertainment venue in Frome was announced yesterday, with 'first come, first served' tickets selling out in under an hour. Sir Paul will also make history as Glastonbury Festival's oldest ever solo headliner when he takes to the stage tomorrow. The festival will see the former Beatle return to top the Pyramid stage bill for the second time after a performance in 2004. It marks exactly a week after celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of music-making. The music offering this year will also feature Kendrick Lamar headlining on Sunday, with Diana Ross filling the Sunday Teatime Legends slot. Glastonbury co-organiser Emily Eavis said on Friday morning that the festival site is 'looking amazing' and 'so beautiful'.

There's 100,000 people here and it's just absolutely gorgeous. Seeing the valley full of tents and flags and people, it's exactly how it should be. It's a really good vibe down here.' Melanie C said it would be 'the dream' for the Spice Girls to play at Glastonbury next year, adding she has a 'good feeling' band member Victoria Beckham would join them. The 48-year-old singer, who played Spice Girl anthems Who Do You Think You Are and Spice Up Your Life during her Glastonbury DJ set at Williams Green stage yesterday evening, described the experience as 'insane'. Mel C plays a DJ set at the Williams Green Stage on day two of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm in Somerset last night She told BBC Breakfast: 'I didn't expect it to be as big as it was and as many people to be going as nuts as they did, it was a wonderful introduction to Glastonbury. 'It's amazing because the wonderful thing about Glastonbury is there is something for everyone, there is so many musical styles and when you drop a Spice Girls song you think: how is it going to go? But people loved it, it was wonderful.' The singer, known as Sporty Spice, wore an 'Alexa play Spice Girls' t-shirt during her DJ set. Talking about the Spice Girls playing at Glastonbury, she said: 'It's the dream, the absolute dream, we would love to do it. 'The girls and I, we have chatted about it, it's the biggest stage in the world, we have the best festival in the world right here.' She added she has a 'good feeling' that Beckham, known as Posh Spice, would join them for the gig.   Ms Eavis was speaking as day three of the musical festival dawned on Worthy Farm, where Eilish will make history. Apart from Eilish, the line-up for the Pyramid Stage on Friday includes Sam Fender, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Crowded House, Rufus Wainwright and Wolf Alice - whose appearance hangs in the balance. In the early hours of yesterday, the band tweeted to say they were stuck in Los Angeles because their flight had been cancelled. In the evening they told fans they were waiting for a 'flight to Seattle' where they could then go directly to London. Then this morning, Wolf Alice posted a video on their Instagram story which showed them on a plane, tagging Heathrow Airport, less than seven hours before their Glastonbury performance. Ziggy Marley is Friday's first performer of the day, on the Pyramid stage, starting at 12.15pm. Other acts performing today include the Sugababes on the Avalon Stage, and Foals and St Vincent on the Other Stage, which also features performances today from Kae Tempest and The Libertines. Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra will also mark their first performance in the UK since their win, with a performance of Shangri-La's Truth Stage on today's bill. Meanwhile the Pet Shop Boys said today that they will bring 'an element of theatre' to their headline performance at Glastonbury and will be 'pulling out all the stops' on the Other Stage on Sunday. The pop duo, comprising Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, told Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2 that the secret to having a career spanning four decades is 'still enjoying it'. Tennant said: 'Forty years ago we didn't really used to tour and now we really enjoy touring and we are looking forward to Glastonbury, the energy level keeps you going.' Lowe revealed he has a 'nap room' with a 'fully made inflatable bed' with the turn-around from being fully asleep to being on stage around 15 minutes. Speaking about their upcoming Glastonbury appearance, Tennant said: 'We always wanted to bring in an element of theatre, we have worked with a young designed called Tom Scutt, we met him three years ago and then we had the pandemic, and since then he has done the new production of Cabaret but people just look at you in a fresh way, so really you take on someone else's perspective of you and that helps to keep it fresh. 'We are pulling out all the stops for Glastonbury, there is going to be someone joining us for one song, it's actually pretty obvious who it is, it's quite exciting.' The duo also revealed they wrote two albums' worth of songs and a musical during lockdown, adapting the story by Hans Christian Andersen The Emperor's New Clothes 'into a Cabaret-type musical', Tennant added.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10952027/Glasto-three-years-Covid-tens-thousands-party-night-Worthy-Farm.html,The Daily Mail
"White House declares monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency: Cases continue to rise across America with more than 6,600 confirmed infections - overwhelmingly among gay and bisexual men",Luke Andrews Health Reporter,2022-08-04 18:08:00,"America's monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Thursday afternoon after the nation's infection tally hit 6,617 cases. Its Secretary Xavier Becerra revealed the shift to an emergency status in a press conference, saying he was prepared to go 'to the next level' and urging every American to 'take monkeypox seriously'. The declaration will make more resources available for states, allow for federal officials being deployed nationwide and enhance data collection on cases, hospitalizations and testing. Cases have been surging by more than a hundred per day for three weeks now, with CDC director Rochelle Walensky admitting today officials were unsure whether this was due to the virus spreading quickly or older infections being picked up. She said the nation was only utlizing about 10 percent of its testing capacity — or 1,000 of 10,000 swabs per day —, and called for more swabs to be sent to labs. The federal declaration comes after New York, California and Illinois — which are facing the biggest outbreaks — all declared their own public health emergencies last week. The World Health Organization made declared an international public health emergency two weeks ago, after the virus was reported in 70 countries where it is not endemic. There is 'huge concern' that monkeypox — which is spread via physical contact — could reach more vulnerable groups after at least five cases have been recorded in children, who are more at risk of serious disease from the virus. Federal officials have been slammed for a delayed response to the virus so far, allowing it to potentially spread unrestricted for weeks before expanding access to testing and rolling out vaccines to the population. At current, the country can perform up to 80,000 monkeypox tests each week. The above map shows which states have recorded monkeypox cases as of yesterday afternoon. The outbreak is biggest in New York, California and Illinois The above shows state's ranked by monkeypox cases. Only Montana and Wyoming are yet to report an infection Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra made the announcement this afternoon. The conference was also attended by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which has been slammed for a slow response to the virus Declaring the emergency, Becerra said: 'In light of all of these developments and the evolving circumstances on the ground, I want to make an announcement today that i will be declaring a public health emergency on monkeypox. 'We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus and we urge every american to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus.' Federal officials were expected to make the move last week, amid alarm over the ever-rising tally of infections. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  : First cases are confirmed in children and a pregnant woman, who are more at risk from the virus. : America set to declare public health emergency over outbreak after its case tally becomes the highest in the world. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, admitted today that officials were not sure whether the outbreak was slowing down. She said: 'Two things are happening at once that I think account for the rise in cases that we are seeing. One is the more widely available testing, and two is potentially more infections that are actually happening as a result of infections that happened two or three weeks ago.  'It is hard to disentangle those right now, but we do expect cases to continue to rise as we get more access to testing people and have more access to testing people.' She said 51 jurisdictions — although the type was not specified — have agreed to share data so far, although she hoped the rest would soon be able to. She also called for more samples to be sent for tests, saying America is only using 10 percent of the 10,000 swabs it can do a day. Almost every case detected so far has been in gay or bisexual men, officials say, although there are growing concerns the outbreak will spread to other groups. To date five children have tested positive for the virus — two in California, two in Indiana and one traveling through Washington D.C. — who are believed to have caught the virus from 'household contacts'. A pregnant woman has also tested positive for the disease. Both groups are more at risk of serious illness if they contract monkeypox, health officials said, and there is 'huge concern' about them catching the disease. During the briefing, HHS chiefs also revealed they had now delivered 600,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine to states. There is no data available on how many people have been jabbed, becuase initially states were not required to report this to the CDC. Within a week of America's first case being detected in a middle aged man in Massachusetts who had recently returned from Canada in May, both New York and Florida also declared their first infections. Since then cases have continued to surge upwards and over the last three weeks rose by more than a hundred infections per day. The biggest rise was the more than 1,000 cases in 24 hours on July 27, but CDC officials said this was mostly down to 'historical' cases only just being reported from California. The disease has also now spread to all U.S. states except Montana and Wyoming — which are very rural — with New York being the national hotspot having registered more than 1,600 infections.

It has mostly been detected among gay or bisexual men MAY 18 (left) and JUNE 8 (right): The above maps show which states have detected cases of monkeypox virus, as it began to spread across the United States Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told DailyMail.com yesterday that the virus was now 'very widespread' in the U.S. and 'not under control'. He also said there was 'huge concern' that it could spill over into other groups — like children and pregnant women — who are much more vulnerable to the disease. Asked about it spreading to more vulnerable groups, Hanage said this was a 'huge question' that was causing 'a great deal of concern'. 'It is unquestionably true that the virus can infect other groups,' he said, '[but] it is not clear how sustainable transmission is within those other groups.'  'The population as a whole remains at low risk, but [officials] are going to have to be watching extremely closely to start checking how much transmission can occur within the other networks. The CDC has been repeatedly blasted for its slow response to the outbreak, with it appearing to repeat many of the same mistakes as with Covid. It took weeks for the agency to ramp up testing, with barely a hundred a day being carried out at the beginning and doctors left faced with hours of paperwork just to get a swab approved to be sent to labs. But they have now signed on five commercial labs, increasing capacity from up to 1,000 to 10,000 tests that can be processed a day. Medics are also being encouraged to send swabs forward. There have also been problems accessing vaccines, with many states saying that they have received too few from the national stockpile. Thousands have been dished out to date, but most of the jabs available when the disease first struck have spent weeks stuck in Denmark while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed a factory inspection. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11081799/White-House-plans-declare-monkeypox-outbreak-state-emergency.html,The Daily Mail
First American to go public with monkeypox infection SLAMS CDC for 'lackluster' testing: Says the virus 'sucks' and warns it should be taken 'seriously',Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-30 15:17:00,"The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. Matt Ford, from Los Angeles, is the first patient to come forward to talk about his monkeypox diagnosis. He is pictured above with three spots due to the virus on his face @jmatthiasford sry the sound was too appropriate  #monkeypox   #monkeypoxvirus   #monkeypoxoutbreak   #monkeypoxvaccine   #CDC   #WHO   #greenscreen   #fyp   #fypシ ♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. 'I think in total I counted 25 and there are also some in more sensitive areas which tend to be the most painful. They're so painful that I had to go to my doctor to get painkillers just to be able to sleep, like really f****** painful.'  Ford also began suffering flu-like symptoms in the early stages, ranging from a fever, chills, night sweat and a cough. He is now isolating at home with most symptoms having largely subsided, but will remain there until the spots have healed over and the scabs dropped off. When he first spotted symptoms on June 17, America's monkeypox cases had just crossed into triple figures. But many scientists warned this was likely an 'undercount' because the CDC was carrying out so few tests every day. The CDC was performing about 60 tests for monkeypox a day last week, leaving it unable to stay on top of the virus. But it has now sent more swabbing kits to private laboratories as it aims to ramp up testing to tens of thousands a day. Ford showed spots on his stomach (left) and arm (right). There were about 25 in total, he said, that had erupted all over his body Ford said he took painkillers because one of the spots around his 'underwear zone' triggered so much pain he couldn't sleep. Pictured above is his arm with monkeypox warning signs Slamming the CDC's tracking of the virus on BuzzFeed, Ford said: 'Many friends and acquaintances [have] reached out to say they either also had it or had been exposed. Matt Ford, pictured above before contracting  monkeypox. He says he lives in Los Angeles and New York City 'While it was reassuring to know I wasn't alone, it also made me worry that cases were being severely undercounted.' He added in a TikTok video: 'According to my doctor... the CDC is doing a really lackluster job of tracking how many cases there actually are. '[This is] due to a lack of testing, and generally not being on top of it.' Ford is America's first monkeypox patient to reveal his identity and be featured in a national publication. Describing his symptoms, he said: 'You can see these [spots] on my face, these are thankfully healing the fastest.  'And then these are on my arms and hands that you can see — they are really not cute. I have got one on my tummy here. And those are just a few of the ones on my body. Previous 1 Next             A day after being warned he had been exposed to the tropical disease, Ford said he began to experience flu-like symptoms which led to him visiting the doctors. Medics took a swab on the Monday, June 20, but did not manage to get him a diagnosis until the following Thursday, the 23rd — by which point he 'already knew' he was infected. A nurse then began to check-in on him daily via phone, and he also received an order to remain at home until all his symptoms subsided. America has now recorded 351 cases of monkeypox. But scientists fear there are many more infections in the country that are yet to be diagnosed Ford is pictured above showing spots that had appeared due to the disease on his face. He made a video for social media to reveal his diagnosis Medical literature says patients with monkeypox initially experience flu-like symptoms — such as a cough or fever — before the characteristic rash appears and spreads across the body. But in the current outbreak this is not what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recording. They say many patients are seeing rashes and spots emerge around the genital and anal areas as the first warning sign. This is then followed by flu-like symptoms and a rash that spreads to the rest of the body. Monkeypox is passed on from close skin-to-skin contact. In the current outbreak it is mostly being transmitted through sex where people come into contact with infectious lesions. But it is not a sexually transmitted disease, and can spread without any sexual activity. In rare incidents it can also spread through the air when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. Monkeypox kills up to 10 per cent of people it infects. However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. There are no specific treatments available for monkeypox infection. However, because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. The US is currently rolling out the Jynneous jab to gay men who regularly have sex with others in New York and Washington D.C. in order to curb its spread. Another patient, based in Chicago, has also come forward on social media with their diagnosis, but has chosen to remain anonymous — going by the pseudonym 'thatgaydoctor.'  Medical literature warns someone can transmit the monkeypox virus for as long as they have any signs. They can only be declared all clear when their spots have scabbed over and dropped off. Ford said he began taking frequent baths and painkillers to help ease pain from his spots, but that it was only 'so-so' at helping with it. Symptoms began to subside about a week after they appeared, he said, but he is now waiting for the final scabs to heal over. The CDC has faced repeated criticism for its testing regime, which many doctors warned initially discouraged medics from asking for the tests. The laborious process requires a patient's sample to first be tested for an orthopox virus — the family of viruses including monkeypox — at a local laboratory. If the result is positive, the sample is then sent to the CDC for confirmation. Critics say the process also requires clinicians to report suspected cases to health departments, who decide whether it meets the criteria to be checked for orthopox. It can also involve calling public hotlines and answering extensive questionnaires, which can be slow and cumbersome dissuading doctors from seeking tests. Health officials were carrying out about 10 swabs for monkeypox a day when the outbreak began, the  Washington Post  reported. This had risen to 60 a day by last week, but was still falling well short of the number needed as the outbreak continued to grow. America has recorded 351 monkeypox cases to date, with another 45 spotted over the last 24 hours. New York and California are facing the biggest outbreaks.  But experts fear this could be just the 'tip of the iceberg', with many more infections in the community going undetected.  Experts say that as the rash-causing virus is spreading under the radar it could well become an 'entrenched' sexually transmitted disease in the population because warning signs can be easily missed. Dr. Jay Varma, an epidemiologist at the Weill Cornell Medical School in  New York City , said early infection signs are 'innocuous' and in hard to see places — like the inside of the anus — raising the likelihood it is missed. This gives the rash-causing virus a window in which to transmit to others, before more serious signs like flu-like symptoms and rashes across the body appear.  Varma added that the tropical disease was also being aided by a lack of STI testing in the U.S., leaving many cases un-diagnosed.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10962529/Americas-monkeypox-patient-come-forward-actor-Los-Angeles.html,The Daily Mail
"Biden administration declaring monkeypox a public health emergency after WHO declared disease a global emergency: US cases soar to more than 2,800",Ruth Bashinsky For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-23 20:32:00,"As  monkeypox  cases soar into the thousands, the Biden administration is considering whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency, after the  World Health Organization  on Thursday  said the virus has become a global problem . On Friday, United States cases of monkeypox topped 2,800 while globally that number surpassed more than 16,000.  While those most susceptible to are men who identify as gay or bisexual - about 99% of the current cases involve men who have sex with men - the diagnosis of two pediatric patients this week raised the level of concern that the virus may be targeting other populations,  MSN  reported.  'We're looking at ways in which the response could be enhanced by declaring a public health emergency,'  White House  COVID response coordinator, Ashish Jha, said Friday. That announcement would come from the Department of Health and Human Services, Jha said.  On Thursday, the World Health Organization held an emergency committee to consider for the second time within weeks whether the expanding outbreak of monkeypox should be declared a global crisis A chart of monkeypox in the United States with New York reporting 830, the highest number of cases, as of July 22. West Virginia, North Dakota and South Dakota have the lowest A chart of the monkeypox virus shows New York at the top with 830 reported cases, followed by California with 356 cases. West Virginia, South Dakota and North Dakota had only one reported case. While the Biden administration mulls its next step, health officials are clarifying how to administer the smallpox antiviral medication, Tpoxx manufactured by Siga Technologi's in pediatric patients.  Jennifer McQuiston, the CDC’s deputy director of high consequence pathogens and pathology, said that infections of people who are not part of the LGBTQ community aren’t surprising. “While this outbreak is spreading in a particular social network right now, I think we’ve messaged from the start that there could be cases that occur outside those networks,” McQuiston said. “We need to be vigilant and ready to respond.” his 2003 electron microscope image made available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows mature, oval-shaped monkeypox virions, left, and spherical immature virions, right, obtained from a sample of human skin associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak The US currently has 1.7 million doses available through the Strategic National Stockpile, but physicians have had trouble actually getting the drugs to patients, MSN reported.  On Friday, the CDC said they were working on streamlining the process health-care providers must go through in order to prescribe Tpoxx.  Another antiviral treatment called Tembexa made by Chimerix Inc. is another vaccine the government is trying to deploy. Tembexa that is known to have some serious side effects has not been studied greatly in humans, a report said.  Bavarian Nordic A/S’s Jynneos vaccine has been a challenge for the Biden administration due to allocation to states and jurisdictions because of limited supply of the shots.  To date, health officials have deployed 300,000 doses of Jynneos with more shots expected to arrive soon.

How to have SEX with monkeypox: CDC releases bizarre guide telling patients to ‘keep their clothes on’ or ‘masturbate six feet from their partner’ if the urge arises while infected,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-16 21:34:00,"The  CDC  has issued bizarre guidance telling Americans infected with  monkeypox  to have sex by masturbating at least six feet away from their partner, among other recommendations. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says anyone who has the disease must not have sex. But for those who ignore the advice, the agency has published a list of the dos and donts under the bedsheets. Among its tips was also to have sex while still fully-clothed, to ensure all rashes are covered and even to avoid kissing. Other advice was to wash hands, fetish gear and clothes immediately afterwards and even to consider having sex virtually such as over the phone.  People catch monkeypox by touching infectious skin lesions, but it can also be spread through the air during 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It can take up to four weeks for anyone infected with monkeypox to recover from the disease, with about eight days needed from infection for symptoms to appear.  Another 12 monkeypox cases were recorded in America Wednesday, in the biggest day-on-day rise since the outbreak began taking the total to 85 cases. Cases are currently told to isolate themselves or hospitalize, in an echo of the early Covid pandemic.  Globally, there are more than 2,000 across about 40 countries outside of West Africa. Previous 1 Next             Health chiefs in Canada and America have issued bizarre advice on how not to catch Covid or monkeypox while having sex. : New York City on how to not catch Covid during sex : Canadian health chiefs on avoiding catching Covid during sex. : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to avoid catching monkeypox from an infected person. The CDC published its guidance on having sex with monkeypox earlier this month on its page on 'social gatherings, safer sex, and monkeypox'.  'If you or a partner has monkeypox, the best way to protect yourself and others is to not have sex of any kind (oral, anal, vaginal) and not to kiss or touch each other's body's while you are sick, especially any rashes or sores,' it reads. '[But] if you or your partner have (or think you might have monkeypox) and you decide to have sex, consider the following to reduce the chance of spreading the virus.' The guidance carries echoes of Canadian health chiefs recommendation in the first year of the Covid pandemic that people use glory holes to have sex. The British Columbia Center for Disease Control said people should 'use barriers, like walls (e.g. glory holes), that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face contact.' A glory hole is a small opening cut into a wall that allows someone to have sex with as little skin-to-skin contact as possible. In 2020 New York City health chiefs also issued advice on how to have sex without catching Covid, telling residents to 'make it a little kinky'. In a three-page memo they told people to avoid casual sex, orgies, or sexual contact with anyone outside their household. But in cases where this was not possible they said people should 'be creative' and use 'physical barriers' like walls. Virtual sex in 'Zoom parties' were also recommended, as well as in chat rooms on the internet. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, with anyone at risk of catching it from others should they touch a rash or skin lesion. But the World Health Organization is currently looking into reports that the rash-causing virus may be spread through the semen. Italian and German scientists say they have detected fragments of the tropical disease in the semen of patients. It is currently unclear whether these pieces are infectious, and capable of causing the disease in another individual. But scientists at the Spallanzani Institute, in Rome, say at least one of their patients had enough fragments in their semen to suggest another person could be infected. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Medical literature suggests monkeypox patients typically experience a flu-like fever followed by a rash emerging on the face before spreading to the rest of the body three days later. But the CDC says in many cases spotted so far patients have skipped straight to suffering the rashes. They add that these are often localized around the penis and anus — and in some cases do not spread to other areas of the body. They would also change at different speeds, with some moving to puss-filled blisters while others still had fluid-filled ones. Medical literature suggests that generally all rashes should progress at the same speed to fluid and then puss-filled blisters. Most infections in the outbreak are being detected among gay or bisexual men and linked to international travel. But at least two have now been spotted among people who have not recently traveled and are not linked to a known infections, suggesting it is transmitting under the radar. Scientists have already raised concerns that monkeypox is likely traveling undetected in some parts of the country. Most infections are mild, and clear up on their own within four weeks. But one in 100 can prove fatal, estimates suggest.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10923921/How-SEX-monkeypox-Bizarre-CDC-guide-revealed.html,The Daily Mail
Monkeypox could infect children by the end of the year due to the slow rollout of jabs to Britons most at risk,Ethan Ennals For The Mail On Sunday,2022-07-16 23:05:00,"Monkeypox  cases could spiral by the end of the year – and reach children, for whom the virus can be deadly – if efforts to vaccinate against it are not improved, experts have warned. While 50,000 vaccine doses are on order, public health experts say four times this number will be needed to halt the spread. In the UK, there have already been more than 1,850 cases of the disease, which causes painful blisters across the body, and numbers are believed to be doubling every 15 days. These have predominantly been seen in gay men. Dr Deborah Birx, the former head of the US Covid task force, told The Mail on Sunday that all gay men in  London  under the age of 50 should be vaccinated as well as women who visit gay bars. 'If you're at a gay bar and you're dancing, then there is a risk of infection,' she said. Monkeypox cases could spiral by the end of the year – and reach children, for whom the virus can be deadly – if efforts to vaccinate against it are not improved, experts have warned The virus is passed on through close physical contact, such as sex, but also kissing and hugging. Vaccines can provide effective protection, but doctors have criticised the slow rollout of the jabs to Britons most at risk and claim the UK does not have not enough doses to stop the virus from spreading into the wider population. There are particular worries that monkeypox could reach children, who are more likely to suffer severe illness as a result. On Thursday, the UK Health Security Agency confirmed that a London school sent reception classes home until the end of term after a child came into contact with a monkeypox case. According to a letter sent to parents, officials advised parents to avoid hugging their children, or any other very close contact, for two weeks. The children will now be offered the vaccine. Dr Deborah Birx (pictured), the former head of the US Covid task force, told The Mail on Sunday that all gay men in London under the age of 50 should be vaccinated as well as women who visit gay bars. 'If you're at a gay bar and you're dancing, then there is a risk of infection,' she said There are two vaccines that can protect against the virus. One, created by a small Danish company, specifically protects against monkeypox. But the decades-old smallpox vaccine also works, because the two viruses are so similar. The majority of over-50s are thought already to have good immunity to monkeypox because they would have received a compulsory smallpox jab in the 1970s and 1980s. The Mail on Sunday understands the UK has 30,000 vaccines – a combination of the two types – and sexual health clinics last week began inviting some gay men to receive the jab. Previous 1 2 Next                   However, experts say at least 200,000 doses of the jab are needed to prevent monkeypox spreading and reaching children, and spreading among them and other vulnerable groups such as pregnant women.  This figure is based on the number of men eligible for HIV-preventative drugs – those who have on average two or more male partners every six months, and as such are at most risk of catching monkeypox. If health officials are able to vaccinate this group, experts believe the disease could be effectively controlled. Examples of the monkeypox rash, which can appear anywhere on the body. In the UK, there have already been more than 1,850 cases of the disease, which causes painful blisters, and numbers are believed to be doubling every 15 days. These have predominantly been seen in gay men Official estimates suggest there are 100,000 men eligible for these drugs in the UK, 70,000 of whom are in London, where the majority of monkeypox cases have already been seen. As with Covid, two jabs are required for the vaccine to have full effect, meaning that, at present, the UK cannot vaccinate all eligible Britons. 'Health officials have told us the current strategy is to get hold of 50,000 doses of the vaccine, but since we need to give out two doses, that means only 25,000 people will get them and that's not nearly enough,' says Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV.  'Currently monkeypox is just affecting this sub-group of Britons, but if cases keep rising it won't stay that way. When it eventually breaks out into the wider population, we'll need a lot more vaccines than we can feasibly get our hands on.' Experts also believe there are many cases going undiagnosed, following a study last week from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium, which showed transmission of the virus may occur without symptoms. More than ten per cent of Britons infected have been hospitalised, though this has predominantly been for pain management, as the blisters can be debilitating, making activities such as eating and going to the toilet excruciating. In people with weaker immune systems, like children, the disease can be deadly. In June, World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was concerned that sustained transmission of monkeypox would lead to the virus establishing itself in the community and could infect 'high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11020005/Monkeypox-infect-children-end-year.html,The Daily Mail

UK's monkeypox outbreak tops 500 cases as health chiefs reveal another 52 Brits have caught rash-causing virus,John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-06-15 13:39:00,"Britain's monkeypox outbreak passed 500 cases today, with another 52 patients sickened with the tropical virus. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses say 'most' new infections are still among gay and bisexual men. England has recorded 504 cases, Scotland 13, Wales five and  Northern Ireland  two.   Health chiefs are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, which is usually only seen in Africa amid fears it could become endemic in Europe. Dozens of countries around the world, including the US,  Spain  and Portugal, have all been affected with around 1,800 confirmed global cases.  The growing tally comes as Pride event organisers said monkeypox must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ celebrations.  It also comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) promised to rename the rash-inducing infection following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term.  Previous 1 Next                         Global Pride events are an opportunity to spread public health messages about monkeypox and must not be cancelled, an expert has told a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing. Steve Taylor, board member at EuroPride, said the virus – which has been mainly concentrated in gay and bisexual men – must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ events. Mr Taylor told the briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. 'We have been working with WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations and event producers across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves. 'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, was asked why cases have been predominantly in the men who have sex with men. She said: 'All outbreaks start somewhere… this virus doesn’t choose any one person against another, it’s opportunistic in its spread. 'And how it will spread will really be defined by the opportunities it has. 'It’s also a disease that has an incubation period of 21 days. We’re just over a month into this outbreak, understanding that outbreak, so it’s too early to conclude as to how it will be spreading amongst the general population.' The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work.  A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The UKHSA this month declared the virus a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles. Britain's latest figures come as two more countries joined global tally of nations in reporting cases of the disease. It comes as Steve Taylor, board member at LGBTQ+ event EuroPride, said monkeypox must not be used as an excuse to shut down pride events. Mr Taylor told a WHO briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. He added that such events could also be used to spread public health messaging about monkeypox so people can keep an eye out for possible symptoms and protect themselves.  Mr Taylor also warned that people who hated the LGBTQ+ could use monkeypox fears as a weapon in an attempt to stop pride events from going ahead.  'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' The latest UK monkeypox figures come as the WHO confirmed it is looking to rename the disease following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term for monkeypox. WHO chiefs promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, confirmed the move. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes. World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed they are in conversation with experts on changing the name for monkeypox Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic A group of scientists from around the world have said the current naming of monkeypox and its clades (different types of the virus) is inaccurate, discriminatory and stigmatising. They say references to West African and Central African monkeypox do not accurately reflect the current monkeypox outbreak sweeping the world. Instead, they suggest ditching terms tied to geography, a move the World Health Organization (WHO) has broadly supported. The scientists have suggested monkeypox in general should now be renamed to MPXV. A number at the end of MPXV would indicate the particular clade of the virus. MPXV1 would indicate Central African monkeypox. MPXV2 for the West African version. And MPXV3 would be term for an offshoot of the West African responsible for pervious and current international outbreaks. But the the scientists add the current outbreak and its sustained human-to-human transmission deserves its own clade.  This would be called hMPXV with letters indicating distinct genetic lineages. With pervious international human-to-human monkeypox outbreaks in 2017-2019 with their own distinct ancestry this would mean the current outbreak would be called hMPXVB.1. While the WHO has said it supports renaming monkeypox, the formal naming of viruses is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses. This international committee of virologists would need to accept any new name for monkeypox for it to become official.   'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.' Monkeypox's naming system currently divides it into two types, the West African version and Central African or Congo Basin version. But experts want them to be replaced with numbers, like MPXV1, MPXV2 and so forth. Naming viruses geographically goes against WHO guidelines because of concerns it may spark abusive backlash or potential racism. It is, for this reason, that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) was not called the Wuhan coronavirus, despite originating in the Chinese city of the same name. Writing in a paper published last week, the coalition of infectious disease researchers from around the world also proposed creating a new 'clade' for the current outbreak. They argue the virus circulating at present has become a distinct 'human virus', compared to MPXV, which rarely transmitted between people. The new type, the experts claimed, should be called hMPXV and lineages should be referred to as A, A.1, A.1.1, B.1. They gave four examples because of data showing the West African strain has evolved slightly, based on samples collected in small human-to-human outbreaks over the past few years. The naming system would be similar system to that used for Covid variants like Omicron, with Britain hit by a wave of BA.2 and now experiencing an uptick in cases of BA.4 and BA.5. One benefit of ditching geographic terms would be encouraging countries to continue monitoring for and raising the alarm when spotting new diseases, rather than having their name negatively attached to it, the scientists said. The responsibility of renaming monkeypox actually lies with the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a committee tasked with formally labelling pathogens. It is not the first time concerns about monkeypox and racism have been raised. Last month the Foreign Press Association, Africa, a media body for journalists on the continent, urged Western media to stop using photos of black people alongside monkeypox stories describing the outbreak in Europe and North America. They accused such outlets of perpetuating 'negative stereotypes that assigns calamity to the African race and privilege of immunity to other races.'  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  Calls to rename monkeypox because of concerns of racism and discrimination echo those regarding some people calling Covid the 'Chinese virus' such as former US President Donald Trump (pictured here at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting last month) Mr Trump was widely condemned over statements referring to Covid as the 'Chinese violence' with some studies finding it increased anti-Asian comments on social media  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  The current term monkeypox is already somewhat misleading as while the virus was first discovered in macaques, many cases are believed to be transmitted to humans by rodents. A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections. With milder strains, the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. Dr Ghebreyesus said that 1,600 confirmed monkeypox cases and 1,500 suspected cases have been reported to the WHO this year from 39 countries, 32 of which have been recently hit by the virus.  But other experts tracking the outbreak say at least 40 nations have logged cases or suspected cases.  While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected countries, Dr Tedros said. However, he added that the WHO is seeking to verify news reports from Brazil of a monkeypox-related death there. The UN agency will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid. Officials are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe too unless it is stamped out soon. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10919427/UKs-monkeypox-outbreak-tops-500-cases-52-Brits-having-caught-rash-causing-virus.html,The Daily Mail
Another 12 monkeypox cases are recorded in US in biggest daily jump since outbreak began a month ago: Nevada becomes 18th state to detect disease in man in his 20s,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-16 16:02:00,"Another 12  monkeypox  infections were spotted across America on Wednesday, officials revealed, bringing the national tally to 85. The new cases marked the biggest day-on-day rise since the outbreak began a month ago, and the first time daily cases have breached double digits. Nevada  became the eighteenth state to detect the rash-causing virus, with a man in his 20s who had recently traveled to another part of the United States testing positive for the virus. Scientists are already warning that the tropical disease may be spreading undetected in some areas, and that patients are not suffering typical symptoms. In an update the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said some patients were facing pain or bleeding around the anus, not previously associated with the illness. Many were also suffering fluid and pus-filled blisters at the same time, whereas previously these would not appear at the same time. It comes after Chicago yesterday became the first city to warn people who 'feel ill' or have rashes to avoid summer festivals to limit the risk of spreading the virus. More than 2,000 cases have been reported across 40 countries — mostly in Europe — outside the native West Africa in the current outbreak. In today's dashboard update, Florida reported the biggest rise in infections after detecting another four — taking its tally to nine. Two were spotted in Chicago and Massachusetts respectively. One case each was also detected in California, Nevada, New York City and Washington D.C. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  New York City currently has the biggest outbreak in the country with 16 cases, according to local officials. Sullivan County, in upstate New York, has reported a presumptive case as well. Official CDC figures list the Empire state at 16 cases.  California is tied for the most infections, also at 16. Concerns were raised this week that monkeypox was spreading undetected in Massachusetts after two cases were spotted with no links to international travel or its first infection from last month. Today another two cases were spotted in men, although health chiefs did not say whether they were close contacts of another case or had recently traveled. Earlier this week Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the state's Harvard University, said infections earlier this week 'certainly indicate undetected transmission chains'. He added: 'I noticed that [health officials in the state] have urged ""vigilance"". I think it is extremely appropriate.' Florida and Chicago are yet to release any additional details about their new cases of monkeypox. But earlier this week Chicago's health officials said people who 'feel sick' or 'have rashes' should not attend summer parties or festivals in case they have monkeypox. It said the guidance was issued to allow residents to make 'informed choices' about where they are mixing with others. Medical literature suggests monkeypox patients experience a fever within the first 21 days of being infected, followed by a rash that covers the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But in an update on Tuesday the CDC said many patients it was recording were not experiencing the typical symptoms. It said many were developing the rashes before fevers, with some never experiencing a fever at all. Skin lesions could also appear all over the body and progress at different times, whereas medical literature suggests rashes would gradually transition to fluid-filled and then puss-filled blisters at the same time. Rashes were also being recorded in the mouth and genital area or anus, which has not previously been associated with the illness. Most cases are among gay and bisexual men and linked to international travel, health chiefs have said. But at least two have now been detected in people with no links to international travel or another known case, suggesting the virus is spreading under the radar in the United States. But CDC chiefs have so far brushed off these cases, saying they are likely contacts of people who returned from international travel but were not diagnosed. It says they are yet to record any urban outbreaks of the tropical disease similar to those being registered in Europe. It comes as the World Health Organization says it will rename monkeypox with a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely also be lettered such as A or B to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes. 'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10923503/Another-12-monkeypox-cases-spotted-biggest-daily-jump-outbreak-began.html,The Daily Mail
Experts slam US response to monkeypox as a 'failure' because public health officials and bureaucrats did not ramp up testing or acquire vaccines in time to control virus: America's infection tally reaches 866,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-12 16:00:00,"The United States' response to the budding  monkeypox  outbreak is being slammed by health experts - blaming officials for being asleep at the wheel and failing to learn lessons from failures early during the  COVID-19  pandemic. The tropical virus has been detected 866 times in the U.S. according to more recent data from the  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention - but there is near-universal agreement among experts that the figure is a severe undercount. Monkeypox has been allowed to spread undetected because of failures in America's testing and surveillance infrastructure - similar to how Covid was allowed to spread so widely early on when it caught the world off guard in early 2020. Unlike Covid, though, monkeypox is not novel, leaving experts frustrated with how top officials failed to deal with a threat they were already knowledgeable to.  Previous 1 Next             'Why is it so hard for something that's even a known pathogen?' Dr Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA said to the New York Times. 'How many more times do we have to go through this?'  America's monkeypox response has been marred by a fractured and limited testing system and limited access to vaccines that could help Americans get ahead of infection. Dozens of people lined up for vaccines against monkeypox in New York City Friday as the city launched its second jabbing drive. The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. At a press briefing last week the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan.  This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. At first, when a person was feeling symptoms of the virus they would be tested locally for the orthopox family of viruses. If positive, their sample would need to be sent to the CDC for confirmation - a process that could take days. This meant that even working as fast as possible, case figures in the U.S. were always going to be days behind. Some of those testing gaps have since been filled, with the CDC announcing in recent days that both Labcorp and the Mayo Clinic had been enlisted in expanding testing capacity. Still, though, access to monkeypox testing is extremely limited and sparse in a nation of over 330 million people. 'It's pretty clear that we need to rapidly scale up the ability to diagnose this now,' said Dr Jay Varma, a Cornell University public health expert who advised the New York City's mayor's office during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some experts are comparing this shortage of testing to where America was early on in the Covid pandemic. One significant difference is that the scientific community had no idea what Covid was when it fist emerged, and how to diagnose it was still unclear. With a virus like monkeypox, which is endemic in some parts of the world and occasionally pops up in the United States, experts believe the same mistakes should not have been repeated again. 'We clearly identified this as a major mistake that allowed Covid to get its footprint in the U.S. and spread undetected for a month, without any of us knowing... and now we're just doing the same thing all over again, because that's the way it's done,' Dr Angela Rasmussen, a public health expert at Canada's University of Saskatchewan told the Times. The rolling out of vaccines has been spotty as well. American officials are believed to have around 800,000 doses of the two-shot Jynneos vaccine - a figure that may not be nearly enough. When vaccines have become available, supply has not been able to meet demand. In New York City - the nation's virus hotspot - walk-in events to receive the jabs often reach maximum demand within minutes of opening. These failures to properly track and prevent spread of the virus has many experts fearing that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., as it has in parts of West and Central Africa.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11006127/Experts-response-monkeypox-failure.html,The Daily Mail
New York City is among the first places in the nation to offer monkeypox vaccinations to the public: ALL appointments are fully booked through Monday though walk-ins are available,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-23 21:21:00,"Gay and bisexual men in  New York City  who are at a 'high risk' of catching  monkeypox  are being offered a vaccine to protect against the infection. Nearly 30 cases of the rash-causing virus, which is usually only spotted in Africa, have been detected in The Big Apple so far. Almost all have been among men who have sex with men. In a bid to stem the rising case tally, the New York City Health Department opened a clinic Thursday to roll out the two-dose Jynneous vaccine —  which is 85 percent effective against infection — to control the outbreak. It is being offered to men aged 18 and over who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners over the last 14 days. More than 100 people queued up for the jab today at Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic, Manhattan, as it opened at 11am. Within three hours the city was forced to suspend walk-in appointments because of demand. The clinic now has all its appointments booked until Monday, with health officials saying they hope to make more slots available 'soon'. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, says the city has only been allocated 1,000 doses so far. It comes two days ahead of Pride celebrations in the city, which are expected to draw crowds numbering more than two million people. New York City health officials are yet to announce any further guidance for the weekend, while areas also holding Pride celebrations including Chicago and San Francisco say they will distribute fliers and make 'public service announcements' over the disease. Vaccines are being offered at the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic (pictured). As many as 100 people reportedly queued outside for the jab today, prompting the city to shelve plans for walk-in appointments just three hours later The above map shows states that have detected cases of monkeypox, and the tally by state. The red numbers show the change in cases over the last 24 hours Monkeypox vaccinations are being administered at the clinic between 11am and 7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, officials say. They have not revealed how they are determining whether patients have sex with men or have had multiple sexual partners, although this is likely being done through a questionnaire. The Jynneous vaccine — which uses a weakened virus — sees patients receiving two injections 28 days apart. Previous 1 Next             The Biden administration has started shipping monkeypox tests to commercial laboratories, in a bid to speed diagnoses for suspected infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' It was designed to fight smallpox, but health officials say it can also work against monkeypox because the two viruses are similar. After running out of slots today, the Department said: 'We hope to make more appointments available soon. 'We are in talks with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain more doses and are looking into how we can boost our capacity citywide.' New York is one of the first city's in America to start rolling out monkeypox vaccines more widely. The city — along with others including San Francisco — had already been offering the jabs to close contacts of confirmed monkeypox cases. Announcing the roll-out today, mayor Eric Adams said: 'As I have said since day one, we are prepared, not panicked and this monkeypox vaccination site is one more critical tool to keep New Yorkers healthy. 'Starting today, eligible New Yorkers who may have been exposed to monkeypox can now get vaccinated to stay safe and slow the spread.' America has now spotted a total of 156 cases of the virus nationwide in almost half of its states. But experts fear many more cases are currently going undetected because they have been mistaken for other diseases or due to problems accessing testing. New York City has the biggest outbreak out of any metropolis nationwide. At a state level California has the biggest outbreak with 40 cases, followed by the state of New York and Illinois with 19. The Biden administration today announced it was rolling out swabs for the disease to commercial laboratories in an attempt to speed up diagnosis and control measures. It comes as America gears up for yet more Pride celebrations this weekend across major cities. Chicago health officials have said they will put a 'special emphasis' on Pride in their warnings this weekend, and have printed off fliers to be handed out at events on protecting yourselves against monkeypox. San Francisco has also said it will be making 'public service announcements' during Pride in the city — expected to draw crowds of more than 500,000 — to remind people to stay safe. Most people who catch monkeypox suffer a mild infection that clears up within four weeks. But statistics suggest about one in 100 people who are infected face a serious illness that results in their death. The disease is primarily transmitted through physical contact with infectious skin lesions, or through touching clothes and bedding that came into contact with a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transferred through 'sustained' face-to-face contact the CDC says. Infected people are tending to experience rashes around the genital and anal areas as a first symptom, before the rash spreads to the rest of the body. They may also face flu-like symptoms.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10947255/New-York-City-places-nation-offer-monkeypox-vaccinations-public.html,The Daily Mail
White House scrambles to ship new monkeypox vaccine to clinics across the country after critics claimed America ALREADY HAS a million doses but Biden 'can't figure out how to get them out of freezers in Denmark',Keith Griffith For Dailymail.com,2022-06-29 04:33:00,"The Biden administration is ramping up efforts to slow the spread of  monkeypox  by distributing tens of thousands of vaccine doses, after facing criticism over its early response to a US outbreak primarily affecting gay men.  The plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine - which has so far been limited - to prevent monkeypox in areas with the highest transmission and need.  The announcement came just hours after advocates sent a  letter  to the  White House  slamming the administration's monkeypox response, saying that 1 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine already owned by the US are stuck in limbo in Denmark awaiting a facility inspection.  Although the vaccine itself has been approved for use by US regulators, the doses in Denmark were produced on a manufacturing line that is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval, officials said earlier this month.   The letter from PrEP4ALL and Partners for Health said in part: 'We must not allow the same failures of vaccine production and distribution that hampered the global COVID-19 response cause us to fail to contain the current monkeypox outbreak.' 'If this is a test run for pandemic preparedness, we are flunking,' PrEP4ALL co-founder James Krellenstein told the  Washington Post . 'We have more than a million doses of a vaccine FDA approved for preventing monkeypox,' he said. 'And the U.S. government cannot figure out how to get it out of freezers in Denmark — doses that it owns — when there's uncontained spread in the gay community.'  Lines form at a New York monkeypox vaccine clinic last week, which quickly ran out of the 1,000 Jynneos doses that were offered to men at high risk The White House plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine - which has so far been limited The Biden administration's new plan will immediately allocate 56,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories, with 1.6 million doses made available by the end of the year, officials said.  State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions' older ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but which has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised.  Previous 1 Next             The United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000 in its stockpiles, officials said earlier this month, but the vaccine is not recommended for those with HIV.  The United States has officially recorded 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions -- but health officials fear that the true count could be higher.  Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread.  The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days Workers sit outside of D.C. Health's first monkeypox vaccination clinic, which is administering the first Jynneos vaccine doses distributed in the U.S. capital on Tuesday Even after Tuesday's announcement, some advocates expressed concerns that vaccines would not get to those who need them the most, including men who have sex with other men, a group at higher risk. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told the Post   that the latest announcement was a 'confusing mess' that did not explain the formula for distributing vaccines. 'There are profound questions of how they will allocate limited vaccines to which jurisdictions, and states and local communities need a coordinated federal plan,' Harvey told the outlet.  'We need to reach people who are at risk for monkeypox and conduct widespread vaccine efforts for gay people and other men who have sex with men.' The White House said in a statement that the vaccine doses will be distributed to 'areas with the highest transmission and need, using a tiered allocation system.' 'As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk for monkeypox have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials have been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox.  Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic  The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Jennifer McQuiston, Deputy Director of CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and gay men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading. The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. 'It's almost like we're expanding the definition of who a contact might be,' said McQuiston. If people have been to a party or other place where monkeypox has been known to spread 'we recommend they come in for a vaccine,' she said.  The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.  There have been no U.S. deaths and officials say the risk to the American public is low. But they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem. One of the steps was to expand who is recommended to get vaccinated. Vaccines customarily are given to build immunity in people before they are ever infected.  But if given within days or even a few weeks of first becoming infected, some vaccines can reduce severity of symptoms. A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, is approved for monkeypox in the U.S. The government has many more doses of an older smallpox vaccine - ACAM2000 - that they say could also be used, but that vaccine is considered to have a greater risk of side effects and is not recommended for people who have HIV.  So it's the Jynneos vaccine that officials have been trying to use as a primary weapon against the monkeypox outbreak. So far, the government has deployed over 9,000 doses of vaccine. Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic to offer the vaccine to all gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the previous two weeks. But all the appointments quickly filled up that day, and the last round of appointments was Monday.  'Until we receive more supply we are unable to release additional vaccination appointments,' said Patrick Gallahue, a spokesman for the city's health department, in an email. On Monday, the District of Columbia´s health department took a similar step. The department started taking appointments at 1pm Monday but had to stop after 20 minutes, Mangla said. The department only had 200 doses of Jynneos, and it was clear at the point that it the department didn't have the vaccine supply or staffing to continue to sign up new people, he said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10963519/White-House-scrambles-ship-tens-thousands-monkeypox-vaccine-doses.html,The Daily Mail
UK spots another 50 monkeypox cases as outbreak continues to grow,Joe Davies Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-06-17 16:34:00,"Another 50 monkeypox cases have been recorded in Britain.  Health chiefs said 46 of the new infections were in England, with three more in Scotland and one in Wales.  The UK has now logged 574 cases over the past six weeks, mainly in gay and bisexual men. It is the biggest outbreak outside of Africa to date.  Authorities are desperately to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe. Dozens of countries have been hit by the current outbreak, including the US, Spain and Portugal. No deaths have been confirmed yet.  Officials warned people to be wary of symptoms — including tell-tale rashes or blisters — especially ahead of summer festivals and events. Previous 1 Next                         Monkeypox will be renamed following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term, it has emerged. The World Health Organization (WHO) promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  It has already swept the world to strike 45 countries, including Britain, the US, Spain and Portugal. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. Dr William Welfare, incident director at UKHSA, said: 'As case numbers of monkeypox continue to rise and with many summer events and festivals ahead, we're reminding people to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox. 'Particularly if you've recently had new or multiple sexual partners, to help prevent further spread and protect others. 'If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don't go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact.' 'Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you've been seen by a clinician. UKHSA bosses are trying to raise public awareness of monkeypox 'so everyone has a safe, happy and healthy summer'. As part of efforts to thwart the outbreak, all confirmed cases and their close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is thought to be around 85 per cent effective at stopping infections. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. Authorities have yet to widen out the vaccination strategy but leading scientists have suggested the next step could involve a targeted rollout to gay and bisexual men.  People who test positive are advised to isolate for 21 days, which his how long it can take for symptoms to fade. They can leave isolation early if their scabs dry and fall off. Patients are advised to wear condoms for eight weeks post-infection.  The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks.  Officials said they have linked the outbreak back to 'gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad'. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be spread through touching contaminated clothing, bedding or towels. The disease, which is similar to smallpox, is usually mild but kills up to 10 per cent of patients.  Current outbreaks are being driven by the least severe strain detected, which has a fatality rate closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. World Health Organization chiefs are going to change the name of the rash-causing virus, it was announced this week. It followed calls from a coalition of scientists for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term. As well as renaming the actual virus itself, strains will likely be lettered to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. The WHO will also hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.  Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10927751/UK-spots-50-monkeypox-cases-outbreak-continues-grow.html,The Daily Mail
Experts warn that monkeypox patients in current outbreak may not have typical symptoms like fatigue and fever - making infection harder to spot in some cases: US infection tally reaches 560,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-06 16:30:00,"Monkeypox  patients that are being infected as part of the current worldwide outbreak may not be exhibiting all of the typical symptoms of the virus, allowing some cases to go undetected, experts fear. A Belgian study released in pre-print on Tuesday found that some patients who had tested positive for the virus right at the start of the outbreak. It comes a week after a UK study found that many patients in the current outbreak were not experiencing fatigue or a fever - often telltale signs of infection. While this is a signal the strain of monkeypox circulating around the world is likely more mild than previous versions of the virus, it also allows for it to more easily circulate undetected. The findings have some officials alarmed as concerns that the tropical virus will become endemic outside of Africa are raised. In the U.S., 560 cases have been detected so far as part of the outbreak though real figures are likely higher because of poor surveillance in America. Previous 1 Next             In the UK study, published Friday in  The Lancet , 54 men who have sex with other men were inspected for potential monkeypox infection. None had any recent travel history to a nation where the virus is endemic or any known exposure to the virus. All also had at least one new sexual partner in the last three weeks. 'The commonly observed symptom of skin lesions in the anal and penile areas, and the fact that a quarter of the patients tested positive for gonorrhoea or chlamydia at the same time as the monkeypox infection, suggests that transmission of the monkeypox virus in this cohort is occurring from close skin-to-skin, for example in the context of sexual activity,' Dr Ruth Byrne, of the NHS, said in a release. The lesions were the primary symptoms experienced by the men, though, with reports of the usual fever and fatigue being limited. A Belgian study, that it still pending peer-review before official publication, made similar findings. Three men tested positive for the virus despite experiencing no symptoms and having no known contact with an infected person. This likely means they picked up the virus from someone else that was asymptomatic, and had they not found out of their own infection, could have continued to spread it to others. 'The existence of asymptomatic monkeypox infection indicates that the virus might be transmitted to close contacts in the absence of symptoms,' researchers wrote. 'Our findings suggest that identification and isolation of symptomatic individuals may not suffice to contain the outbreak,'  This undetected spread is the worst fear of health officials around the world.  Experts are warning that in the U.S. in particular, the undetected spread is also occurring because of how poorly federal officials have expanded access to testing and vaccines.  'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told  The Hill . 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. Testing for the virus has been a slow and arduous process so far. When a patient begins exhibiting symptoms of the virus they are first examined for the orthopox family of viruses. The lineage includes monkeypox - along with the extinct smallpox virus - and it is likely that anyone who tests positive for it does have the tropical infection. In order to confirm a monkeypox case, samples must be sent to the CDC for testing, where it is then confirmed. Testing is slow, though. Access to these test is limited as well. This makes many experts fear that cases are going undetected. The federal government has taken steps to expand capacity but access to tests is still relatively limited. On Wednesday, the CDC announced that it had partnered with Labcorp to expand testing, doubling the capacity of testing to 20,000 per week in the near future. There have also been cases detected so far with no links to international travel or to another case of the virus - meaning there is some undetected circulation of the virus ongoing. 'We've been sort of screaming for a month about how bad the diagnostic situation is for monkeypox,' James Krellenstein, cofounder of Prep4All, told The Hill. 'And that really was a clear error, preventable, and it's very clear that this administration has not learned lessons from early Covid.' The nation's vaccine rollout has been under intense scrutiny as well. American officials have ordered around 4.4 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine - including an additional 2.5 million last week. Getting the shots into arms has been a challenge, though. New York City had its first public vaccine event two weeks ago - ahead of Pride festivities in the Big Apple - but demand for the jabs was so high officials had to cut off walk-in appointments in a matter of hours. People waiting at the clinic for the shot told DailyMail.com that the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million. Other eager recipients accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Some experts are comparing the currently broken response to monkeypox to that of COVID-19 when it first erupted in March 2020. 'I think we'll continue to repeat these mistakes because that's been our track record. That's been our track record,' Jon Andrus, a global health professor at GW, said. 'We've had, what, more than five or six waves of Covid, and we seem every time to be a little bit caught off guard,... stopping transmission requires that we're all reading from the same page. We all have the same road map.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10987997/Monkeypox-patients-not-typical-symptoms-making-infection-harder-spot.html,The Daily Mail
Monkeypox outbreak in Los Angeles soars to 22 cases after Pride events as health officials warn disease is spreading among gay community,Paul Farrell For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-27 04:58:00,"Los Angeles  records 22  monkeypox  cases after Pride events as health officials say outbreak is running rampant among gay community.  'Anyone can get and spread monkeypox, but some of the recent cases identified have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men who attended large events where the exposure to monkeypox may have occurred,' said Los Angeles Department of Public Health in a statement. The warning comes after a month of Pride celebrations in the city that included Pride in the Park on June 11, a concert that attracted over 20,000 people and included a performance from Christina Aguilera as well as the city's parade which occurred on June 12. According to  the Los Angeles Times,  thousands of people lined the city's streets to celebrate the return of the parade following a two-year hiatus due to  Covid-19 .   As of June 2, there were just three cases of monkeypox in all of California,  NBC News  said at the time.  There are now 51 reported monkeypox cases in California and 199 cases nationwide, according to the CDC.  LA is now offering the JYNNEOS vaccine to 'individuals at a higher risk of monkeypox.'  JYNNEOS is a vaccine used to treat smallpox and monkeypox that was first approved for use in the US by the Federal Drug Administration in 2019.  New York City began a rollout of the vaccine in preparation for their Pride celebrations this past Thursday. There are 35 reported cases in New York state.   Most early cases in the US were in people who had just returned from traveling abroad. But the disease has spread quickly, especially among gay men.  Worldwide, health officials have already warned that there is a spike in monkeypox cases in male gay and bisexual communities.  Monkeypox — native to West Africa — has now been detected more than 3,000 times across 40 countries where it is not typically found this year.  The above map shows the spread of monkeypox across the U.S. The virus has now been detected in 24 states. Previously, New York was the epicenter of the outbreak but it has now been surpassed by California Revelers in Los Angeles enjoying the Pride parade earlier in June 2022. Following the celebration, health officials warned that recent cases in the city 'identified have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men who attended large events' Similar to New York City, the city of Los Angeles is offering the JYNNEOS vaccine to 'individuals at a higher risk of monkeypox' The theme of Los Angeles' Pride parade this year was 'Love Your Pride' The tropical disease is primarily spread through physical contact with infectious rashes, but in rare cases it can also be transmitted through 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Many patients have rashes on their genital area and anus as a first warning sign, before the disease spreads to the rest of the body. It can take up to four weeks to get better from the disease, with most cases being mild and clearing up on their own. Someone remains infectious until their rashes have scabbed over and eventually fallen off. Previous 1 Next             In May 2022, Andy Seale, a strategies adviser with the World Health Organization, was  quoted  as saying that it's important for people to celebrate Pride events as normal. He said: 'It's important that people who want to go out and celebrate gay pride, LGBTQ+ pride, to continue to go and plan to so.'  Seale also said: 'Given that this is not a gay disease, the transmission routes are common to everybody. The advice is pretty much the same for all people.'  Also in May 2022, Dr. David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO's emergencies department, told The Associated Press that the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission at raves held in Spain and Belgium.  'We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission,' said Heymann.  Monkeypox does not spread easily from person-to-person and requires the exchange of bodily fluids or prolonged exposure to someone who already has the virus There have been no deaths recorded amid the 2022 outbreak of monkeypox in Europe and the US Just a few days before Pride events kicked off in New York City, 'at risk' gay and bisexual men were offered the vaccine This week, WHO stopped short of declaring Monkeypox a global health emergency but did say that the situation would be reviewed again next month.   The Biden administration has started shipping monkeypox tests to commercial laboratories, in a bid to speed diagnoses for suspected infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was deeply concerned about the outbreak. 'I am deeply concerned about the monkeypox outbreak, this is clearly an evolving health threat that my colleagues and I in the WHO Secretariat are following extremely closely,' Tedros said. The 'global emergency' label currently only applies to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing efforts to eradicate polio, and the U.N. agency has stepped back from applying it to the monkeypox outbreak after advice from a meeting of international experts. New York City  health chiefs were blasted for their 'last minute' roll out of  monkeypox  vaccines just two days before the city's Pride weekend Friday — as scores of walk-ins were turned away on the second day of inoculations.    Last Thursday, the city became the first in the U.S. to start offering the jab to the most 'at risk' gay or bisexual men. But within three hours of launching the drive it was forced to suspend walk-ins due to 'high demand', and all appointments were booked solid until Monday. At least 100 men queued for the jab last Thursday morning, with many not having bookings arriving up to two hours before the clinic opened. But all walk-ins were turned away and told to check online for new slots.   Chris LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, slammed the 'pop-up' inoculation and slammed the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan for failing to turn up to monitor the vaccinations. Men waiting to get inoculated today said it was 'ridiculous' that only 1,000 doses were available in a city of eight million. Others slammed health officials for giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Many of those who got the vaccine today expressed their relief, saying they would now be able to enjoy the Pride weekend safely — which is expected to draw crowds numbering more than two million. One man even left the clinic telling a friend, 'we can make out tonight!'  No deaths have been recorded amid the 2022 outbreak, but health officials warn it could spill over into more vulnerable populations if the outbreak is not contained.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955541/Los-Angeles-health-officials-warn-monkeypox-outbreak-spreading-gay-men-cases-rise-22.html,The Daily Mail
"US becomes global monkeypox capital as record-breaking 1,048 diagnoses brings total cases to 4,639 - overtaking Spanish count of 3,738 infections",Harriet Alexander,2022-07-28 01:02:00,"The United States has become the global epicenter of the  monkeypox  outbreak, overtaking  Spain  following a record-breaking 24 hours in which 1,048 new cases were confirmed. The updated data for Wednesday shows that there are now 4,639 confirmed cases in the U.S. Spain currently has 3,738. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on Wednesday that the uptick in cases was likely due to an increase in testing, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week. By population — which takes into account the U.S. having seven-times more people than Spain — America has about one case per 100,000 people.  Spain's tally is seven per 100,000.  The infection rate in the U.S. is also below many other European countries including the UK and Germany (both at three per 100,000). A protester on July 21 holds up a sign in New York City demanding the government do more to make the monkeypox vaccine available Experts fear the disease has already spilled over into more vulnerable groups, such as children under eight years old that health officials say are at high risk of severe disease.  Two children — in California and 'transiting through' D.C. — have tested positive for monkeypox to date, the CDC says.  Previous 1 Next             America's response to monkeypox was slammed for being too slow to roll out tests and vaccinations at the start of the outbreak, especially to gay or bisexual men where most cases are being recorded.  No deaths have been registered to date but several patients have been hospitalized. DailyMail.com averaged the daily rise in cases over the latest seven days available to calculate how fast they were ticking up every 24 hours.  This showed the U.S. is currently recording about 216 monkeypox cases a day on average, while in Spain 108 per day are being detected. Washington D.C. has postponed its roll out of second doses of the monkeypox, joining New York City. Its Department of Health revealed the move Monday, citing 'very limited' supplies of the jabs and a fast increase in cases. They said: 'This is extremely important because getting more individuals vaccinated with their first shot will help us contain the virus.' America is rolling out the two dose Jynneous vaccine to fight monkeypox, with the second dose due to be given four weeks after the first. But some experts say it is possible to widen the gap — as was done with the Covid vaccine in other countries — to ensure more people can be inoculated first. A Food and Drug Administration vaccines adviser has warned against the move, however, saying no studies have been carried out to determine whether it will ensure the jabs are still effective. Both New York City and Washington D.C. are offering monkeypox jabs to gay or bisexual men with multiple sexual partners. It is unlikely that another European nation will surge ahead as experts say many — including the UK — are now seeing their outbreak start to peak.  Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, said: 'The U.S. was slow to kick off widespread testing, and so now is detecting transmission chains that have been carrying on uninterrupted for some time.  'We don't know how much increased awareness, especially in the core communities of gay and bisexual men, will slow transmission down. 'But it is reasonable to suggest that the U.S. case count will continue to grow and will outpace the outbreak's elsewhere.' Spain is at the center of Europe's monkeypox outbreak, being among the first country's to report the disease — with early cases linked to unsafe sex among gay or bisexual men at a venue outside the country's capital, Madrid, and a Pride event in the Canary Islands. Since then the vast majority of cases have been detected in the same group, but some have been spotted in women — often those living with gay or bisexual men. A three-year-old also tested positive for the virus. Health authorities in the country have rolled out vaccines to close contacts in order to curb cases, but there have been problems getting hold of doses.  Spain — like the U.S. — is using the Jynneous vaccine, but only had 200 doses available in early July. It has said more doses will be ordered, but has not specified a number. In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected. Hotspots New York City and Washington D.C. are rolling out vaccines against the virus to gay or bisexual men with multiple partners in two weeks to put a lid on the virus, but these programs have hit a brick wall with too few doses being supplied by the Federal Government.  Spain has the most per capita cases of monkeypox, while the U.S. has the greatest total number Both cities are now delaying second doses, due four weeks after the first, due to demand. A total of five million vaccines have been ordered so far, on top of the more than one million that were available when the program began.  Testing has also been ramped up after it was slammed early on for the stringent guidance on which samples could be tested leading to just 23 swabs being checked for the virus a day early in the outbreak. Five commercial labs have been brought onboard now with a combined capacity for about 80,000 swabs per week.  Daily tallies have rocketed since, with the biggest daily increase yet reported on Wednesday, with 1,048 cases in the last 24 hours. Breaking the data down by area shows New York City currently has the largest outbreak at 1,040 confirmed infections according to its Department of Health. The CDC says the state has 990 infections at present.  It was followed by California, at 356, and Illinois, with 341. Only four states — Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming — are yet to detect a single infection with the disease.  It is not clear whether other states — alongside New York — are preparing to start vaccinating gay or bisexual men where most cases are being detected to get a handle on the outbreak. Monkeypox is normally confined to West Africa, but earlier this year it was picked up at a Pride festival in Spain. Since then more than 40 countries worldwide — mostly in Europe — have spotted cases of the disease, which are mostly among gay or bisexual men. Unlike in previous outbreaks, the disease appears to mostly be spreading via sexual contact with lesions — which allow transmission — initially appearing on the genital and anal regions. Experts say the disease has likely already spilled over into other groups, however, which are more at risk.  In the U.S., two children were found to have been infected last week. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11056039/US-global-monkeypox-capital-record-breaking-1-048-diagnoses-24-hours-sees-total-pass-Spain.html,The Daily Mail
"REVEALED: Monkeypox is now in almost EVERY state in America - as nation's outbreak spiralled from dozens of cases a week to hundreds a day by mid-July as California, Illinois and New York declare a state of emergency",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-03 21:21:00,"Monkeypox  has now been detected in almost every U.S. state as cases reached the 6,326 mark across 48 states, the District and Columbia and Puerto Rico — with only Montana and Wyoming not having logged an infection, official figures revealed today. The national outbreak of the virus has spiraled since the first case was detected in Boston,  Massachusetts , in late May. It has consistently surged by more than a hundred cases a day over the last three weeks amid ramped up testing with New York and  California  having emerged as national hotspots. Alongside  Illinois , they have declared emergency states to handle the virus. Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told DailyMail.com that the virus likely arrived in many states much earlier than when it was officially detected. He points to anecdotal reports from Spain of monkeypox-like patients in February — three months before the outbreak began in Europe.  Hanage warned it was now 'very widespread' and 'not under control' across the United States, and that there was 'huge concern' it could spill over into other groups. There is mounting concern that monkeypox — which spreads via physical touch — could already be transmitting into more vulnerable groups like children and pregnant women, who are most at risk from serious disease. Five cases have been spotted in under-18s so far and one in a mother-to-be, with experts warning there may be others that are not being picked up because of a lack of testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has repeatedly being slammed for its slow response to the virus, failing to ramp up testing quickly to spot cases and to roll out vaccines fast to stymie the tide of cases. The above map shows the states that have reported monkeypox infections up to August 2nd, the latest date available. It reveals that almost every one has now detected it except Montana and Wyoming MAY 18 (left) and JUNE 8 (right): The above maps show which states have detected cases of monkeypox virus, as it began to spread across the United States JUNE 22 (left) and JULY 6 (right): The virus was detected in yet more states and in larger numbers following celebrations for Pride. It has mostly been detected among gay or bisexual men JULY 20 (left) and JULY 27 (right): The CDC starts to report far more cases once testing is ramped up. It has recorded more than a hundred every working day for the past few weeks The CDC has made monkeypox a nationally notifiable condition starting August 1, making all states and localities report case figures to federal officials each day. They hope is that this will not only give Americans a more accurate daily look at the state of the virus, but also smooth out reporting figures each day. So far almost every infection has been detected in men, with the vast majority also identifying as gay or bisexual. But there are signs that the disease — spread via physical touch — may now be spreading to other groups. Within a week of the first case being reported in a man who had recently returned from Canada, New York and Florida both reported their first patients. By the end of June more than half of U.S. states — or 34 — said they had detected the virus at least once. Cities including New York and Washington D.C. began to administer vaccines against the disease to gay or bisexual men to quell the growing outbreak. Previous 1 Next                   A second child in California is thought to have been infected with monkeypox, health officials revealed today taking the U.S. tally to five. The youngster — under 17 years old — presented with unspecified symptoms of the virus at a clinic in Los Angeles. They received treatment, and have since recovered,  they said.  It is likely they became infected from a 'household contact', like in two other cases in children.  Cases among children are sparking concern because those less than eight years are at heightened risk of severe disease and death if they catch the virus. Two cases were reported in children in Indiana this week, although no further information was given. A case has also been reported in a toddler in California and a baby that was travelling through Washington D.C.   But the rollouts were dogged by delays receiving doses and there being too few to meet the 'enormous' demand to get inoculated. Into July the situation only worsened with the U.S. infection tally crossing the milestone of 1,000 cases within the second week of the month. By the end of this month 48 states — even Maine, Vermont and Alaska — had all picked up the infection. Cases spiraled over this month as testing capacity expanded from 1,000 to 10,000 swabs a day — with New York alone recording infections in four figures by the end of the month. A record 1,048 cases were reported on July 27, but the CDC said this surge was down to 'historical cases' being reported mostly from California — which had not updated its count for days. The growing sense of crisis led San Francisco to become the first city to warn it would declare an emergency over the outbreak. Days later it was followed by New York City, alongside the states of New York, Illinois and California as a whole. No declaration has yet been made at the federal level though it has reportedly been considered by the Biden administration. Several patients have been hospitalized so far — in some cases only because they could not isolate at home — but no deaths have been reported in the U.S.. There have been ten to date globally, including four outside Africa — with four in Spain and one each in Brazil and India.  Commenting on how the virus had spread, Hanage told DailyMail.com: 'We are not necessarily seeing spread, what we are seeing here is detection. 'There has been so little testing for so long and it has been so patchily applied... that what you are actually seeing is transmission chains that were already started some time ago and now finally people are cottoning on to them. 'That sounds like it is a positive thing, but it is not really.  '[The maps] show the outbreak is already very widespread and not under control. It really is only a matter of time before all states pick it up.' There is mounting concern that the outbreak — now at 6,326 infections — could soon spill over into children and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the virus. America has detected five cases in children to date, with the latest being in a child from Los Angeles, California. State officials say the youngster was 'symptomatic' but has now recovered. Two children have also tested positive for monkeypox in Indiana, while cases have been detected in a toddler in California and a baby that was 'travelling through' Washington D.C. Three of the cases likely caught the virus from 'household contacts'. A pregnant woman has also tested positive for the virus in the U.S., but did not pass on the virus to her now-born baby. Experts say it poses the greatest risk early in the pregnancy, because it could lead to developmental abnormalities in the fetus. Asked about it spreading to more vulnerable groups, Hanage said this was a 'huge question' that was causing 'a great deal of concern'. Dr Bill Hanage, from Harvard University, (left) warned there was great concern that the virus would spill over into other groups. Dr Robert Murphy, the executive director for the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, told DailyMail.com it was too early to tell whether cases had begun to peak because testing had been so inconsistent. Pictured above are men queuing to get the monkeypox vaccine in Encino, California. It is being rolled out to the group as this is where the most cases have been detected Pictured above are men queuing for the jab in San Francisco, California. The city has complained it is getting too few jabs 'It is unquestionably true that the virus can infect other groups,' he said, '[but] it is not clear how sustainable transmission is within those other groups.' 'The population as a whole remains at low risk, but we are going to have to be watching extremely closely to start checking how much transmission can occur within the other networks. 'At the moment, we are systematically under-identifying cases because we are not testing there.' There is no sign in the data yet that cases may be slowing down, with CDC officials warning at a briefing last week that they expect the tally to keep rising for 'weeks'. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  : First cases are confirmed in children and a pregnant woman, who are more at risk from the virus. Dr Robert Murphy, the executive director for the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, told DailyMail.com it was too early to tell whether cases had begun to peak because testing had been so inconsistent.  'Cases detected now were so under-report it is difficult to say what's happening now. There have been inconsistencies in testing, and this is also not a reportable disease in the United States which could impact the figures,' he said. But he said it was possible that the roll out of vaccines and raised awareness of the disease — which may be sparking changes in sexual behavior — could be slowing the spread of the virus. Even if the U.S. did get on top of the outbreak, however, it will likely need to brace for future introductions from other countries where the virus will continue spreading. In particular, this includes Africa where several nations including Nigeria have been battling an outbreak of the disease for years. America was recording less than ten cases a day during the first few weeks of the outbreak, but at the time medics were complaining they were struggling to get people with monkeypox-like symptoms swabbed for the disease. But when private labs were brought in last month — ramping up capacity to more than 10,000 swabs a day — the number of cases spotted every 24 hours rocketed into the hundreds. The CDC has been repeatedly blasted for failing to get swabs rolled out early leaving the United States unaware of the scale of the outbreak. It has also — alongside the federal government — being criticized for failing to offer swabs against the virus rapidly to those who are most at risk from the disease. Before the outbreak, the country's national stockpile was allowed to dwindle from 20 million to just 2,400 doses of the vaccine — a drop of 99.9 percent — in the years leading up to the outbreak. Initially, the stockpile was expanded over concerns that bio-terrorists could weaponize smallpox — which the vaccines also work against. But as the jabs three-year shelf life came to an end instead of replacing them federal officials invested in developing a longer-lived vaccine. This meant that by the time monkeypox struck there were very few doses still available in the country, slowing the roll out. This was then further hampered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) taking weeks to complete an inspection of a new factory where the jabs were being put into vials before being shipped to America. New York City, Washington D.C. and parts of California are among those currently rolling out the jab to all gay or bisexual men to help curb the outbreak — and have complained they are not receiving enough jabs.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11077465/How-monkeypox-spread-American-state.html,The Daily Mail
"Height of hypocrisy: Newsom declares monkeypox a state of emergency in Cali after allowing gay, leather kink festival to go ahead - but BANNED kids from going to school during pandemic",Alastair Talbot For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-02 18:13:00,"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared the  monkeypox  outbreak a state of emergency in  California , despite a gay, leather kink festival taking place in San Francisco over the weekend - a little more than a year since kids were banned from going back to school due to COVID. California became the second state in three days to take the step, after New York, and Newsom said the declaration will help state officials better coordinate a government-wide response, seek more vaccines and lead outreach and education efforts on where people can get treatment and vaccination.  'We'll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the  LGBTQ  community fighting stigmatization,' Newsom said. A booth offers information on monkeypox at the 'Dore Alley,' or also called the 'Up Your Alley' fetish and leather festival on Folsom Street in San Francisco on Sunday, as the viral disease keeps spreading in California. Nearly 800 cases of monkeypox have been reported in the state Nearly 800 cases of monkeypox have been reported in California, according to state public health officials. But that didn't stop the LGBTQ+ community on Sunday from organizing a street fair called 'Dore Alley' or 'Up Your Alley,' a leather and fetish event that is commonly compared to to the Folsom Street Fair — California's third-largest single-day and outdoor spectator event — as well as the world's largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture.  Festival officials made sure that this year's venue was more spread out and that hand sanitization stations were seen California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over monkeypox on Monday, becoming the second state in three days to take the step after New York -- the epidemic of the viral disease Kinky games and street vendors selling leather apparel including chokers, collars, whips and bondage kits are a common at the venue, which mostly attracts gay men out of any demographic. A sound stage was also set up for festivalgoers to dance. 'I like to think of it as the biggest leather block party,' Executive Director Angel Adeyoha told  ABC 7 .   She raised her concerns, however, over the timing of this year's festival, especially as it took place soon after the City of San Francisco announced a state of emergency over monkeypox on July 28.  'I don't know if you came in previous years, but you would be body to body. Clearly that's not the case now, we've made room for folks,' Adeyoha told ABC 7. In 2020, both the Up Your Alley Fair and Folsom were canceled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This year, the San Francisco Department of Public Health was on-site to inform the local community about the viral disease and to keep them safe by adding hand sanitizing stations. The festival was also more spread out than usual so people could freely roam around.  'I think probably more risky things in both Outside Lands and Dore Alley will be the things that happen after the event or around the private event spaces, where people are intimate with each other,' UCSF infectious disease specialist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong told  NBC Bay Area . With a growing monkeypox outbreak that has so far predominately affected gay and bisexual men, city officials in San Francisco have declared a state of emergency.

In 2020, the venue was canceled due to COVID  Previous 1 Next             The monkeypox virus spreads through prolonged and close skin-to-skin contact, which can include hugging, cuddling and kissing, as well as through the sharing of bedding, towels and clothing. People getting sick so far have mainly been men who have sex with men, though health officials note that the virus can infect anyone. 'Public health officials are clear: stigma is unacceptable and counterproductive in public health response,' Michelle Gibbons, executive director of the County Health Executives Association of California said. 'The fact is that monkeypox is primarily spread by skin-to-skin contact and sharing objects like bedding or towels, without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.' The type of monkeypox virus identified in this outbreak is rarely fatal and people usually recover within weeks. But the lesions and blisters caused by the virus are painful and can prevent swallowing or bowel movements if in the throat or anus. The declaration in California came after a similar one in New York state on Saturday, and in San Francisco on Thursday. Newsom's administration had said as recently as Friday that it was too soon for such a declaration. After pressing for Newsom to make such a declaration, State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-SF) hailed the governor's decision. 'The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,' Wiener said. People stand in long lines to receive the monkeypox vaccine at San Francisco General Hospital on July 12 A man holds a sign urging increased access to the monkeypox vaccine during a protest in San Francisco, July 18 Newsom's proclamation allows emergency medical personnel to administer monkeypox vaccines that are approved by the federal government. That's similar to a recent law that allows pharmacists to administer vaccines, Newsom's administration said. It said the state's response is building on the steps developed during the coronavirus pandemic to set up vaccination clinics and make sure there is outreach to vulnerable populations in cooperation with local and community-based organizations. California has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses and has distributed more than 25,000 doses. 'We don't have any time to waste,' Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement. She said the nation's most-populous county must use all available resources to speed the distribution of vaccines and help to those who have been infected. Newsom's office said Los Angeles County has received a separate allocation of vaccine. As of last week, the state had expanded its testing capacity to process more than 1,000 tests a week. Critics have said the long wait for test results delayed treatment options. New York City is home to one of the United States largest LGBT communities, and is in line to receive 110,000 doses of the federal governments 800,000 upcoming monkeypox vaccines - but Governor Kathy Hochul still wants more.  Case counts in New York City, the current US epicenter of the outbreak, surpassed 1,400 on Friday.

Is America's monkeypox outbreak REALLY the worst in the world? Statistics show it has the eighth- highest case count per million residents - a fourth of Spain's total: The US has declared a public health emergency,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-05 19:31:00,"The United States on Thursday became the first country to declare a public health emergency over the  monkeypox  virus, the only thing is: America's outbreak is four times smaller than the largest outbreak in  Spain , with statistics showing that it has the eighth-highest case count per capita, official figures show. The U.S. has detected the most monkeypox cases out of any country, with its total reaching 7,102 Thursday — more than a third higher than the 4,577 detected in the next highest country, Spain. But when this tally is considered per population — a more accurate measure because it takes into account America's much larger head count — the U.S. ranks eighth, with 21 cases per million people.  That's equivalent to one in 47,000 people having a confirmed infection to date. Conversely, in Spain, the number is 96 per million or one in 10,000, also higher than every American state. Dr Jessica Justman, an infectious diseases expert at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City, said even though the U.S. was behind other nations the number of infections detected and nature of illness — with patients suffering painful lesions — meant it was right to declare an emergency. Hundreds of cases are still being detected daily in the U.S. whereas in other European countries — like the UK — the outbreak is now slowing down. America moved to an emergency footing yesterday, two weeks after the World Health Organization also declared an international emergency over the outbreak. Justman added that other nations would likely follow suit, but said it was also possible they had not moved to this level of alert because of differences in how they operate. Experts have warned it would be the 'worst public health failure in modern times' should monkeypox become entrenched in the United States because it 'could have been prevented'. Unlike with Covid, accurate tests and effective vaccines were already readily available — but there has been a struggle to roll them out. The above left panel shows the total monkeypox infections detected per country over time, and on the right it shows this as a rate of per million people. Experts said it was more accurate to consider the data in this way because it shows the difference in infections between nations. Figures are from OurWorldinData, a data platform run by experts at Oxford University  The above graph shows monkeypox cases per capita in Spain, which has the highest infection rate, and the five U.S. states with the highest rates of the virus — New York, Georgia, Illinois, Florida and Maryland. It also shows the infection rate for the whole United States (the dotted line) The above shows the number of cases per state, and each states tally. This data is not shown as a monkeypox infection rate per million people Pictured above are people lining up to get a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine at Obregon Park in Los Angeles, California Figures for monkeypox infection rates per million people by nation were calculated by  OurWorldinData , a platform run by experts at the prestigious Oxford University in the United Kingdom. DailyMail.com used population data from the US census bureau to calculate infection rates per million by state. At the ground level, it shows Spain currently has the biggest monkeypox outbreak in the world per head with 96 cases per million people (one in 10,000). Portugal has the second highest rate at 69 per million, followed by the Netherlands at 54 per million and the United Kingdom at 39 per million. Germany (34), France (33), and Canada (23) also have a higher tally than the US. Previous 1 Next                   The EU is set to repeat its COVID vaccine shambles with a failure to deliver monkeypox jabs. Doctors are having to turn away patients because of a lack of doses, with the bloc's collective procurement policy stalling again. While the UK has ordered more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses, Eurocrats have procured just 160,000 for its 27 members. As many as 1,000 vaccinations were recorded in a single weekend in London. But in hotspot Madrid, where there have been monkeypox deaths, there have been only 790 vaccinations in total. Dr. Jean-Christophe Goffard, of the Erasme Hospital, in Brussels, said: 'The vaccine is not available in Belgium at the moment. 'We've had a growing demand for tests... and close to 90 per cent prove positive. 'We don't have the impression we are currently able to control the epidemic well.' The EU's two biggest powers, France and Germany, have turned their backs on the EU scheme and are buying their own vaccines. Spain was one of the first countries to detect monkeypox in men who attended Pride festivals in May, and there are anecdotal reports that the virus may have been circulating in the country as early as February. Both Spain and Portugal are yet to launch a mass vaccination drive for all gay or bisexual men — although this may be because both nations are struggling to get hold of adequate Jynneos doses from Bavarian Nordic, which is being used to treat the virus. But in Europe there are now signs that some monkeypox outbreaks may be starting to run out of steam as health authorities get a grip on the outbreak. In the UK, health authorities there say cases are now beginning to 'plateau'. They recorded 299 new infections over the past seven days, drawing level with the 261 infections detected the previous week. This is not the case in the United States, however, since which is now recording about 439 cases a day on average compared to just 224 two weeks ago. No clear data was available on testing rates, but if other countries are testing less this suggests their outbreaks may be outpacing the U.S. even further. America can currently carry out about 10,000 tests a day for monkeypox, but only about a tenth of these are being utilized. Asked whether the U.S. was right to shift to an emergency footing, Justman said: 'I think this is a situation that does require mobilization of resources of recruitment and access. 'Is it a response that has been done with careful thinking, and we should not dismiss this because it happens to primarily effect a smaller segment of the population.' She added: 'I am glad that the U.S. is declaring an emergency, that is a good thing.' There is no sign of other countries following suit. For example, in the UK monkeypox was only ever designated a level two outbreak — reserved for transmission within a defined sub-population. This is two markers off level four or the highest level of alert, when there is evidence of wider community transmission of the virus. Breaking down America's figures into states also shows that none have a higher infection rate for monkeypox than that reported in Spain. New York had the highest at 88 cases per million, followed by Georgia (50), Illinois (45) and Florida (26). Compared to their European counterparts, New York, California (which ranks 10th out of US states) and Illinois have each already declared emergencies over the outbreak of the virus and started rolling out vaccines to gay or bisexual men. At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, admitted officials were still not sure to what extent the cases they were detecting represented new spread or historic cases that were only now being picked up thanks to ramped up testing. But cases have risen by several hundred every day for the past few weeks, with the virus now being detected in every state except Montana and Wyoming — which are both very rural. Last week officials warned the tally would likely continue to rise for weeks. Monkeypox is a serious disease that triggers flu-like symptoms in the early stages before patients develop a rash that will spread across almost all of the body. It is not like COVID, being spread via physical touch alone. Almost every case has been identified in men with the vast majority identifying as gay or bisexual to date in America. But there are fears that it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk of serious disease. Pictured is a man receiving his first dose of the monkeypox vaccine at Dekalb County Board of Health in Atlanta, Georgia. Second doses are being delayed in many areas because of a lack of supply Pictured above are men waiting to receive a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine in New York City. It is at the center of the nation's outbreak of the virus At least five cases have been spotted in children so far — two in California, two in Indiana and one traveling through Washington, D.C. — who likely caught the virus from 'household contacts' and one case in a pregnant woman. Both groups are more at risk of serious illness. Declaring the emergency yesterday, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources Dr. Xavier Becerra said: 'In light of all of these developments and the evolving circumstances on the ground, I want to make an announcement today that i will be declaring a public health emergency on monkeypox. 'We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus.'  The declaration will make more resources available for states, allow for federal officials being deployed nationwide and enhance data collection on cases, hospitalizations and testing. Federal officials have been slammed for a delayed response to the virus so far, allowing it to potentially spread unrestricted for weeks before expanding access to testing and rolling out vaccines to the population. At current, the country can perform up to 80,000 monkeypox tests each week. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11084691/America-eighth-biggest-monkeypox-outbreak-world-data-shows.html,The Daily Mail
"US records first two CHILD monkeypox cases: California toddler and an infant in D.C. were likely infected by 'household contacts' and both had contact with gay or bisexual men, CDC chief says",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-22 22:14:00,"Two children have tested positive for  monkeypox  in the United States, the  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention revealed Friday. One is a toddler from California; the other is in an infant who is not a U.S. resident and was 'transiting through' Washington D.C. Neither had contact with each other.  Health officials said both children were 'doing well', but warned children under the age of eight are at high risk of severe monkeypox.  It is thought both children likely caught the virus from 'household contacts'. Dr Rochelle Walensky said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak.  It was not clear when they caught the virus, or what symptoms they suffered. They are receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation.   They are the first cases among children to be detected in America. There are currently more than 2,500 cases of monkeypox in the U.S. — the second biggest outbreak in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. A  boy under 10 years old  tested positive for the virus in the Netherlands in June, as was revealed this week. The Dutch child suffered more than 20 red lesions on his face, forearms and thighs but had no fever or swollen lymph nodes — with the infection mostly clearing within a week.  Two children have tested positive for monkeypox in the United States since the outbreak began, it was revealed today Revealing the infections at a virtual event for the Washington Post, Walensky said: 'We have seen now two cases that have occurred in children. 'Both of these are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community, the gay men's community.' She added that these cases have been on the whole 'adjacent to the community most at risk'.

There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  In a press release, the agency said: 'CDC and public health authorities are still investigating how the children became infected. 'While both children have monkeypox symptoms, they are in good health.' They added: 'Monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which — in the case of children — could include hugging, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups and utensils.'  Last week the CDC said it was only aware of monkeypox infections among adults, mostly in gay or bisexual men. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert warned last week the virus had likely already spread to other groups, but that this was yet to be detected due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that children — as well as older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. In the Dutch case, doctors said they counted 20 lesions on the face, ear, forearms, thighs and back of the child — but that he did not suffer a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, they added. It was not clear how he became infected, although doctors said he likely had contact with an infected person or contaminated object that 'was not recognized'. Monkeypox primarily spreads through close physical contact or towels or bedsheets that have also been used by a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transmitted through the air.  The CDC has been repeatedly slammed for its response to the virus, with testing initially being slow to get off the ground masking the spread of the virus. There have also been problems rolling out the vaccine, with New York City — at the epicenter of the crisis — having to delay second doses for patients because too few jabs have been supplied.  A  Dutch  child under the age of ten has tested positive for  monkeypox  after a family holiday to Turkey - the first confirmed pediatric case as part of the current outbreak of the tropical virus.  The unnamed youngster was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes. Doctors counted 20 lesions over his face, ear, forearms, thighs and back, but the patient did not have a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, and he made a full recovery. None of his close contacts tested positive for monkeypox. It is not clear how he became infected, but testing has ruled out it being down to sexual abuse. The family-of-five said they had no close contact with other guests while on holiday and put their own towels on chairs and loungers. His parents, one of his siblings and a friend — who were all considered high-risk — were vaccinated with the Jynneous jab, which is being used in America.  The report comes as the United States confirms its first two cases of the tropical virus stateside, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The youngster — who has not been named — was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes (pictured is one of the first on his jaw) More than 20 rashes erupted over his body, they said Pictured above is one of the rashes that appeared on his arm  Doctors at the Dutch hospital revealed the diagnosis Thursday in the journal  Eurosurveillance . Dr Marceline van Furth, who led the investigation, said they were publicizing the case to 'raise awareness... that monkeypox can develop in children'. They warned that children — alongside older adults and pregnant women — are more vulnerable to monkeypox, with about three percent dying form the infection. Previous 1 Next             A man in California says he has been infected with COVID and monkeypox at the same time in the first known case in America. Mitcho Thompson, a cannabis salesman in Sebastopol, tested positive for the pandemic virus in late June after feeling 'wiped out'. Days later, red lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which he said doctors diagnosed as monkeypox. Thompson was bedridden for weeks as trouble breathing and chills left him barely able to get up for water. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious diseases expert at Stanford University, said it was possible for someone to be infected by both viruses at once. He said Thompson had had 'incredibly bad luck'. It comes as America's monkeypox tally surges to 2,593 cases — the second highest tally in the world, right behind Spain, which has 3,125 cases. More than 16,000 cases have been detected globally in the current outbreak, mostly among gay or bisexual men who caught the disease through sexual contact. Experts fear the disease has likely already spilled over into other populations, but has not been detected yet because of a lack of testing. Monkeypox does not require sexual contact to spread, and is mainly transmitted via close physical contact or scabs that get stuck on towels or bedding. In rare cases it can also be passed on through the air. America has detected 2,500 cases in the current outbreak — the second highest tally in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. The Netherlands has spotted 700, while Turkey has detected a single case. The Dutch monkeypox patient first realized he was unwell shortly after returning from Turkey, when he noticed two small red skin lesions on his left cheek and jaw. His doctor initially diagnosed mild dermatomycosis — medical term for a fungal infection — and prescribed anti-fungal cream. But when more lesions appeared the medic feared he had impetigo — a bacterial infection that causes lesions on the body — and gave him antibiotics. When they continued to crop up over his ear, forearm, thighs and back the boy was referred to hospital with a suspected case of monkeypox — with swabs at the hospital being  positive. His parents and two siblings were then also tested for the virus, but all returned negative results. Dutch health authorities vaccinated both parents, one sibling and a friend who were deemed to be at 'high risk' of being infected. None later developed the virus. An investigation was launched to establish where the child caught the disease, but it was inconclusive. There was no evidence that the child had been near a suspected or confirmed case of monkeypox before catching the disease. The parents also said they had taken care while on holiday to use their own towels and had not had close contact with other guests, limiting the risk of transmission. Analyses revealed the strain the boy caught was the same as the one circulating in Europe's current outbreak. In the paper, the medics wrote: 'As no plausible source could be identified, this leaves us with an open question regarding transmission. 'In the current outbreak, the predominant route of transmission is related to sexual activity in the community of men who have sex with men. 'However, other indirect transmission routes have been described, such as respiratory transmission through droplets or contaminated materials such as bedding and towels. 'Therefore, it is possible that the child was in close contact with an infectious person or contaminated object that was not recognized as such.' They said it typically takes about eight-and-a-half days for someone infected with monkeypox to start showing symptoms. But suggested it was likely longer — up to 21 days — for the boy because the route of transmission was different. He had traveled to Turkey three weeks before symptoms began to appear. His parents said the boy had chickenpox when he was five years old.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11040679/Two-children-test-positive-monkeypox-CDC-confirms.html,The Daily Mail
Dozens of people line up for monkeypox vaccine in NYC as it offers the shot to gay and bisexual men with 'multiple partners' as US tally now tops 700 cases,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-08 17:24:00,"Dozens of people lined up for vaccines against  monkeypox  in  New York City  Friday as the city launched its second jabbing drive. The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. New York now has 141 cases of monkeypox, the most out of any city in the United States — which has registered 700 infections to date. Pictured above is the queue of mostly men waiting to get the monkeypox vaccine at Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan, New York City. Appointments ran out in minutes yesterday Vaccines against monkeypox are being offered to men who have sex with men who have multiple sexual partners in a week They are also available to any close contacts of suspected or confirmed monkeypox cases New York City is the first metropolis to record more than 100 cases of the virus in America New York's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is rolling out vaccines against monkeypox at the Central Harlem and Chelsea clinics. They also plan to bring in the Corona sexual health clinic, in Queens, over the next few weeks. At a press briefing yesterday the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan. Previous 1 Next             New York City became the first metropolis in America to record more than 100 cases of monkeypox late Wednesday, just over a week after its annual Pride celebrations. The city's Department of Health revealed it has now spotted 119 infections with the tropical disease, up by half on the same time seven days ago. Before the Pride weekend concerns were raised that the events — which drew crowds numbering more than 2 million — could spread monkeypox. In San Francisco officials have already linked several Pride-themed parties in nightclubs to outbreaks of the disease. America has recorded 700 cases of monkeypox to date, with most in New York, California and Florida. No deaths have been reported. This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. But residents have previously blasted these paltry tallies as 'ridiculous' considering the city has a population of several million. Officials initially released 600 appointments Wednesday but, because of the glitch, they only went to people who had a link to the old appointment site stored on their browsers. This meant these were all booked up before they were released to the general public. Later that same day another 1,900 appointments were made available — but these filled up in just 10 minutes. The city offered walk-ins during the first roll out of 1,000 doses, but quickly shelved them due to high demand.  Nicholas Diamond, one of those who spent hours refreshing the New York City website to get a dose, told the New York Times: 'By following the Department of Health's instructions, we had zero chance of getting the vaccine. 'I am really concerned that the city, state and federal government have learned nothing from the Covid response, and essentially the burden again has been left on us to figure out how to care for ourselves.' Announcing the launch of the roll-out, Vasan said: 'Providing vaccine for New Yorkers at highest risk of transmission will ensure more New Yorkers are protected against monkeypox. 'Thank you to our federal partners for providing the necessary support we need to curb transmission and keep New Yorkers safe.' He added that the city would continue to 'work with' the federal government to secure further doses. Patients are being offered the Jynneous vaccine, which is given as two doses about four weeks apart. Experts say recipients should have some protection shortly after getting the first dose, but that they won't be fully protected until about two weeks after the second. The jab — made using weakened smallpox viruses — is about 85 percent effective against infection with the disease. New York City became the first major city in the country to hit more than 100 cases of monkeypox yesterday, more than a week after Pride celebrations. Washington D.C. is the only other area rolling out jabs to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners at present. Monkeypox is spread by direct physical contact with infectious skin lesions, which in the current outbreak are appearing in the genital and anal areas. Health chiefs have been repeatedly slammed for their slow response to the outbreak, in echoes of the Covid era, and for failing to make enough tests and vaccines available for people affected.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10995625/Dozens-people-line-monkeypox-vaccine-NYC.html,The Daily Mail
"Monkeypox isolation rules DITCHED for contacts of infected because virus is mainly spreading through sex - as UK buys another 100,000 vaccines to thwart ever-growing outbreak",Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-07-19 19:05:00,"Close contacts of  monkeypox  cases will no longer need to self-isolate unless they develop tell-tale symptoms, UK health chiefs announced today. Only those who develop ailments such as a fever, headache and rash after being in contact with someone infected will now need to stay at home.  UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said the change, which includes people who have had sex with the infected, is because only a 'relatively small number' of contacts develop monkeypox.  Officials said there is a 'lack of evidence' the rash-causing virus — usually only spotted in west and central Africa before the current global outbreak took off in gay and bisexual men — is spreading outside of intimate contact and sex. Dr Merav Kliner, deputy incident director at UKHSA, said that while self-isolation is easing, monkeypox still poses a 'serious public health challenge'. Contacts should still 'take a break' from skin to skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing 'to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly', she said. Meanwhile, the UKHSA today confirmed cases had surpassed the 2,000 barrier.  It has bought 100,000 extra doses of the smallpox vaccine, which works against its milder cousin monkeypox and is offered to close contacts and some gay and bisexual men as part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. The US today entered a new deal to buy half a million more doses of the vaccine, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. Its extra supply will be delivered this year. For comparison, the UK is understood to have just 25,000 doses — 20 times fewer than America's order Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious Previous 1 2 Next                         : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa.

All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria.

The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria.

The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   The UKHSA guidance sets out new steps for high-risk monkeypox contacts — including sexual contacts who did not use a condom, household contacts and medics who treated an infected person without PPE. Until now, contacts had to isolate for 21 days.  As well as not having to isolate, these groups now should only contact NHS 111 or a sexual health clinic if they develop symptoms. A fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion are the initial monkeypox symptoms, which are followed by a rash that looks like chickenpox or syphilis.  However, high-risk contacts are told to avoid skin-to-skin contact with others, refrain from sexual contact, avoid international travel and let dentists know you are infected. People who have physical contact with a monkeypox case or touched their bedding are told to avoid contact with under-fives, pregnant women and the immunosuppressed. If they work with anyone from these groups, the UKHSA or their employer may inform them to take time off after a clinical assessment. Health teams are offering smallpox vaccines, which are 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, to close contacts who had a high-risk exposure to an infected person. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been proven to work in other outbreaks. And gay and bisexual men who are at a 'high risk' of catching monkeypox were offered the jab from last month. But latest UKHSA data shows the outbreak is continuing to grow.  Since the first case was detected on May 6, there has been 2,137 confirmed monkeypox infections. And the figure for July 18 is up by 272 since July 14. Of these, 2,050 are in England, 51 are in Scotland, while 23 are in Wales and 13 in Northern Ireland. Within England, the vast majority (1,492) are in London. Hotspots also include the South East (172), North West (115) and East of England (82).  Almost all of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. Almost all of the cases are mild and no deaths have been recorded.  Dr Kliner said: 'We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow. 'Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms. 'While our advice on isolation is changing, monkeypox is still a serious public health challenge, and we urge contacts to take a break from any activities or events involving skin to skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly.  'Stay alert to symptoms and call a sexual health clinic if you become unwell. 'Thank you to all contacts who have isolated already in response to this outbreak. We understand that isolation can be difficult but this was a necessary precaution whilst our knowledge of the outbreak was limited.' It comes as health chiefs today bought another 100,000 smallpox vaccines from Denmark-based Bavarian Nordic. The doses will arrive between July and September. The UK had already ordered 30,000 doses of the vaccine to rollout to infected people and their contacts.  Studies have shown Imvanex — known as Jynneos in the US — is around 85 per cent effective at preventing a monkeypox infection. The vaccine was developed for use against smallpox but offers cross-protection against monkeypox because the viruses are so similar. Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: 'Monkeypox is a rare and usually mild disease that does not spread easily between people. 'But we are taking action to help further manage the outbreak in the UK by procuring over 100,000 additional doses of vaccine. 'The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine, and I would urge people to take up the offer as soon as they are contacted.  'In the meantime, please contact a sexual health clinic if you notice any unusual rashes or lesions. 'I am hugely grateful to the fantastic sexual health staff and 111 call handlers for working hard to keep the current outbreak under control.' Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, head of immunisation at UKHSA said the additional doses mean the UK is 'in an even stronger position to bring the current monkeypox outbreak under control'. She said: 'Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people. 'So it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.  'Anyone can get monkeypox and we continue to urge anyone with a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, to take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact.  'Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.'   Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection who have symptoms are being told to stay at home. And those without symptoms are told to avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'. As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a wider targeted jab rollout to more NHS staff and female sex workers in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases and some gay and bisexual men are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 70 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. Most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Germany, US and France. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11029133/Monkeypox-isolation-rules-DITCHED-contacts-infected.html,The Daily Mail
'Complete hell': Texas man warns monkeypox is '100 times worse' than Covid and left him with blisters so painful they felt like 'someone was taking a potato peeler to your skin',Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-20 15:55:00,"A man in  Texas  has warned  monkeypox  was 'complete hell' and '100 times worse than Covid' after catching it — as cases in the United States topped 2,000. Luke Shannahan, who works as a bartender in Dallas, revealed in an interview that the disease left him suffering a 101F fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes making him look 'like a frog' just two days after he was told he had been exposed. Blisters then erupted all over his body that were so painful it felt like 'someone was taking a potato peeler to your skin' whenever they brushed against something. Shannahan was administered a monkeypox vaccine after he was diagnosed, but still became bedridden for two days and felt so ill he feared for his life. The patient is not sure how he became infected, but had attended bars, pool parties and a music festival in the days beforehand. Luke Shannahan, who lives in Dallas, said monkeypox left him with blisters that were so painful it felt like someone was taking a potato peeler to his skin whenever he brushed against something Pictured above is one of the blisters Shannahan suffered after catching monkeypox. They were extremely painful, and the disease was '100 times worse' than Covid, he said He was administered a vaccine by the local department of health, but still ended up bedridden for two days with the disease. At one point he feared he would die Revealing his illness, Shannahan told  KHOU 11 : 'It's just the most traumatic experience I've ever had. It's the worst sick I've ever been. 'You have these blisters that are inflamed and anytime it grazes something or touches something, it literally feels like someone is taking a potato peeler to your skin.' In a separate interview with  NBC 5 , he revealed a contact tracer first alerted him that he had been exposed to the rash-causing virus. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  Two days later he had a temperature, constant headache and swollen lymph nodes. Which were then followed by painful blisters. 'The pain and tenderness was constant,' he said. Asked whether it was like Covid, he said: 'Oh, 100 times worse. this was a totally different level of extreme fatigue.' Shannahan was diagnosed two weeks and a day ago, and says most of his symptoms have now subsided. But he will still remain in isolation for at least three weeks. Patients must remain in quarantine until all their blisters have scabbed over and the scabs have dropped off because even these could spread the virus, according to official guidelines. Shannahan has set up a gofundme page to replace lost wages as a bartender, which has so far made him $1,700. Texas has recorded 81 cases of monkeypox to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. These are mostly among gay or bisexual men, although this week the Lone Star state also announced its first case among women. Nationwide, infections have quadrupled over the last two weeks amid a surge in testing for the virus. It has prompted warnings from some top experts that America has likely 'lost control' of the disease. But CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky hit back against the claims yesterday, insisting they were 'misinformed and off base'. Other experts say it will take another few days to become clear whether the rash-causing virus is now out of control in the United States. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Monkeypox patients are offered the Jynneous vaccine in the early stages of their illness, which doctors say can help reduce symptoms. It is set to help kick-start the immune system to fight the virus off. Many are also being offered TPOXX, an antiviral which works by stopping the monkeypox virus from invading other cells. It was designed for use against smallpox, but is also being used to fight monkeypox infections because the two viruses are closely related. There are mounting concerns over a shortage of monkeypox vaccines in the U.S. at present.  New York City and Washington D.C. are the first to start offering the jab to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. But in both appointments are running out in minutes when they are released, with New York now warning it may not be able to dish out second doses. Residents have branded it 'ridiculous' that there are so few vaccines available in a city of more than eight million.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11031999/Complete-hell-Texas-man-says-monkeypox-100-times-worse-Covid.html,The Daily Mail
FDA is set to clear new monkeypox vaccine technique that RATIONS the shot by only giving people 20% of the normal dose - as regulators insist it is still effective,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-09 20:12:00,"The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) is planning on green lighting plans to make America's supply of  monkeypox  vaccines last longer by slashing the dosage 80 percent and changing the way it is delivered to patients. Bloomberg  reports that in order to quell a shortage of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine officials are planning on delivering doses of the vaccine that are only 0.1 milliliter (ml) - a massive fall from the 0.5 ml standard dose. They believe that using an intradermal injection - which delivers the vaccine between the layers of the skin instead of underneath the skin's fat - will make sure the shot is just as effective. The FDA is set to approve plans to cut the dosage of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine by 80%, and deliver it intradermally in a bid to solve America's vaccine shortage (file photo) It comes in response to a massive shortage in monkeypox vaccines available in the U.S. Officials have so far distributed only 600,000 doses to state and local jurisdictions around the country. When jabs have become available in major population centers like New York City, appointments have been filled within minutes due to the exceedingly high demand. The science behind the move is limited, though. A single 2015  study  funded by the National Institutes of Health shows that vaccines can be just as effective through the intradermal route, but no other data exists. This would be a massive shift in America's response to the virus based on limited existing evidence. The move comes as the U.S. logged a record 1,424 cases on Monday, the highest total since the global outbreak first found its way stateside in May. In total, the U.S. has logged 8,934 infections - the most of any country. This outbreak could soon get worse as well. The new school year is set to begin at colleges and universities across the U.S. in the coming weeks. Young students are more likely to engage in careless sexual behavior, creating a perfect storm for potential monkeypox outbreaks around the nation. Previous 1 Next             Officials wrote in an email obtained by Bloomberg that the FDA will soon give emergency clearance to the rationed jabs.  The Jynneos vaccine was developed by Bavarian Nordic for smallpox, but it also effective against monkeypox. Last week, FDA Chief Robert Califf explained that this new approach will allow the nation to make the most of its resources without losing effectiveness. 'The upside is you can stretch out doses,' Dr John Moore, a virologist at Cornell University told the  New York Times  of the plan.  'The downside is, if you cut it too far or take too many liberties, you reduce the efficacy. And how are you going to know that? It's educated guesswork.'  Federal officials currently have access to around 1.1 million shots - well short of enough to cover vulnerable populations in America. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services declared the virus a public health emergency, opening the door for regulators to make these types of moves. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that America's monkeypox outbreak can still be controlled But there are some questions as to whether this is the right move. In 2015, researchers gathered that smallpox vaccines were just as effective when delivered in smaller doses if the injection was performed intradermally. It was just one study performed on 524 participants, though, and using a different vaccine. Currently, shots are mainly reserved for men who have sex with other men - though some exposed people have been granted the shot as a precaution. Access to the shots may need to be expanded soon. Some officials fear that the virus has already escaped that sexual network and is now in other groups as well. 'There's a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Dr Scott Gottlieb, formed FDA chief, told  CBS' Face the Nation  over the weekend. 'We're continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.' While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that gay and bisexual men still make up a majority of cases.  The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point. Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained. 'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate. 'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11096293/US-regulators-set-clear-new-monkeypox-vaccine-technique-rations-jabs.html,The Daily Mail
Experts warn that the US could soon lose control of monkeypox due to lack of testing and limited access to vaccines,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-04 15:02:00,"Some experts are warning that gaps in testing and vaccine coverage for  monkeypox  will leave the United States vulnerable to losing control of its tropical virus outbreak. Public health leaders from the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSD) and George Washington University (GW) warn that a fractured and lacking response to the outbreak so far can have severe consequences. Previous experts have warned that the virus has likely been spreading undetected in the U.S. for some time, and fear it could become endemic in the nation is not curbed soon.  As if Friday - the most recently available data - the U.S. has logged 460 cases across 31 states and the District of Columbia.  Iowa  is believed to have recorded its first case over the weekend as well, though Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) figures have not yet reflected it. Previous 1 Next             'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told  The Hill . 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' Testing for the virus has been a slow and arduous process so far. When a patient begins exhibiting symptoms of the virus they are first examined for the orthopox family of viruses. The lineage includes monkeypox - along with the extinct smallpox virus - and it is likely that anyone who tests positive for it does have the tropical infection. The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. In order to confirm a monkeypox case, samples must be sent to the CDC for testing, where it is then confirmed. Testing is slow, though. Access to these test is limited as well. This makes many experts fear that cases are going undetected. The federal government has taken steps to expand capacity but access to tests is still relatively limited. There have also been cases detected so far with no links to international travel or to another case of the virus - meaning there is some undetected circulation of the virus ongoing. 'We've been sort of screaming for a month about how bad the diagnostic situation is for monkeypox,' James Krellenstein, cofounder of Prep4All, told The Hill. 'And that really was a clear error, preventable, and it's very clear that this administration has not learned lessons from early Covid.' The nation's vaccine rollout has been under intense scrutiny as well. American officials have ordered around 4.4 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine - including an additional 2.5 million last week. Getting the shots into arms has been a challenge, though. New York City had its first public vaccine event two weeks ago - ahead of Pride festivities in the Big Apple - but demand for the jabs was so high officials had to cut off walk-in appointments in a matter of hours. People waiting at the clinic for the shot told DailyMail.com that the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million.  Other eager recipients accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed.  Some experts are comparing the currently broken response to monkeypox to that of COVID-19 when it first erupted in March 2020. 'I think we'll continue to repeat these mistakes because that's been our track record. That's been our track record,' Jon Andrus, a global health professor at GW, said. 'We've had, what, more than five or six waves of Covid, and we seem every time to be a little bit caught off guard,... stopping transmission requires that we're all reading from the same page. We all have the same road map.' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10980519/Experts-warn-soon-lose-control-monkeypox.html,The Daily Mail
"NYC health chiefs are blasted for last-minute roll out of monkeypox vaccines just two days before Pride weekend, as scores of walk-ins are turned away on the second day of inoculations",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-24 22:16:00,"New York City  health chiefs were blasted for their 'last minute' roll out of  monkeypox  vaccines just two days before the city's Pride weekend Friday — as scores of walk-ins were turned away on the second day of inoculations. Yesterday the city became the first in the U.S. to start offering the jab to the most 'at risk' gay or bisexual men. But within three hours of launching the drive it was forced to suspend walk-ins due to 'high demand', and all appointments were booked solid until Monday. At least 100 men queued for the jab this morning, with many not having bookings arriving up to two hours before the clinic opened. But all walk-ins were turned away and told to check online for new slots. Chris LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, slammed the 'pop-up' inoculation and slammed the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan for failing to turn up to monitor the vaccinations. Men waiting to get inoculated today said it was 'ridiculous' that only 1,000 doses were available in a city of eight million. Others slammed health officials for giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Many of those who got the vaccine today expressed their relief, saying they would now be able to enjoy the Pride weekend safely — which is expected to draw crowds numbering more than two million. One man even left the clinic telling a friend, 'we can make out tonight!' New York City is America's monkeypox hotspot with more than 39 cases detected so far, with almost all among gay and bisexual men. Nationwide the tally has hit 179 cases, with fears mounting the rash-causing virus is spreading undetected. More than a hundred men lined up outside the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan today to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. The clinic only admitted people who had got appointments, and turned away all others Two lines had formed this morning outside the clinic. One was for people hoping to get a walk-in jab - who had been there since at least 9am - and the second was for those with appointments. New York City suspended walk-ins yesterday just three hours after the clinic opened due to 'high demand' Attendees were first screened at a pop-up clinic (pictured) to ensure they were eligible for the jab. They were then sent inside to one of seven booths where the vaccine was being administered by a nurse. Recipients had to wait about 10 minutes after they were inoculated to ensure they suffered no side-effects. Men who have sex with men, and had multiple sexual partners over the past two weeks are eligible for the jab Pictured above are men embracing each other while they wait in the queue for the Jynneous vaccine. The jab is designed to fight off smallpox infections, but scientists say it also works against monkeypox because the two viruses are similar Chris LeBron, the Democrat candidate for the 75th district — which includes the Chelsea area of Manhattan — blasted New York City's health officials for their last minute and 'random' roll out of the vaccines.

The jab is being rolled out via appointment between 11am and 7pm New York City is offering gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners within two weeks the monkeypox vaccine at the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan. Today marked the second day the vaccine has been administered in the city, with a line of men in their 20s and 30s forming outside the clinic. It has the capacity to vaccinate up to 170 people a day at present, with seven nurses jabbing one person every 20 minutes. After getting the jab, recipients are required to wait for a further 10 minutes to ensure they have not suffered any side-effects — like with the Covid jabs.  New York City says it will be open from 11am to 7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. It is yet to open up bookings for appointments this Monday.  It is rolling out the Jynneous jab — which is 85 percent effective against infection — which is administered as two doses four weeks apart. Experts say recipients gain immunity from monkeypox days after getting the first jab. Previous 1 Next                   Chicago will put a 'special emphasis' on warning Pride attendees of the risks of catching monkeypox this weekend, while San Francisco's parade will be punctuated by regular announcements over the disease amid fears the events could spark an uptick in cases. The Windy City's Department of Public Health told DailyMail.com they would put out guidance on social media and print fliers to be handed out at events. In San Francisco, California, which is also due to host a parade this Sunday, announcements will be made on 'best practice' when in crowds. America is gearing up to celebrate Pride this weekend in major cities — with crowds expected to exceed two million in New York alone. But it comes amid a growing outbreak of the rash-causing virus with 179 cases detected so far, many among gay and bisexual men.  Several cases are not linked to international travel or other known infections suggesting it is already spreading undetected. New York City became the first to offer jabs against monkeypox to the most 'at risk' men this weekend. But it has been slammed for rolling out so few doses.  Experts say vaccinated people have protection shortly afterwards. Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, said for people exposed to monkeypox it gives protection 'immediately' providing it is administered within the first four days of contact with a case. Blasting the Department today and health commissioner for the city, LeBron told DailyMail.com: 'Do I think enough is being done? No. 'The fact that these vaccines just popped up and a random announcement was made is actually detrimental to individuals faith in Government when dealing with a health crisis like this. It does nobody any good. 'I do believe the Health commissioner of New York City should be here, present, to assess what's happening right now. 'There is a line of individuals waiting for canceled appointments, and there is a high need clearly for this vaccine. 'He needs to come here, he needs to assess, he needs to apply proper policy and planning to ensure that these individuals get the service they deserve.' People began lining up for the vaccine — even if they didn't have an appointment — from 9am this morning, in either the appointments or walk-ins lines. By the time the clinic opened its doors at 11am, more than 100 people were queuing up for the jab and the line stretched around the side of the vaccination center. Among those turned away was Yougourten Ayouni, 24, an advertising technology consultant who came back today after queuing for two hours yesterday and being sent away. He told DailyMail.com that staff working the clinic kept 'contradicting' each other, with some saying they were not taking walk-ins and others saying they would but only after five or six hours when they see how many appointments were missed. Slamming the Department, he said: 'Everybody is not on the same page and they have only a thousand vaccines and there website is already booked up. 'I don't understand why even start telling people to just wait and get an appointment etcetera. They are just not being honest, they are not being forward, and everybody is not on the same page.' Derek Brant, 33, a sales manager and one of the few to get vaccinated today, said it was an 'incredible' stroke of luck to get the jab but also 'ridiculous' that New York City had so few shots available. 'It's kind of ridiculous that there are only 1,000 doses,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I feel very lucky to have got one, I'm trying to count my blessings about it.' He heard about the clinic yesterday via a friend who sent him a link to the vaccination clinic. Another furious couple leaving the clinic, who asked not to be named, said it was a 'disgrace' that these jabs were being handed out just a day before the city's Pride weekend. New York City announced yesterday that it was rolling out the monkeypox vaccine to the most at risk men. Pictured above is the queue to get the vaccine that formed today  Pictured above are men queuing to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. They will need to return for a second jab in the next four weeks, and are being invited via email Men began queuing from 9am this morning to get the vaccine. Pictured above are several waiting in the queue Recipients told DailyMail.com the jab did not hurt to get. Many were given a plaster afterwards (pictured) A health worker talks to a man waiting in line for the vaccine to protect against monkeypox  : A total of 47 people are found to have been infected with the virus after coming into contact with animals.  This was linked to a shipment of 800 rodents — including squirrels —  from Ghana to Texas. Some of the infected animals were then moved to Illinois and housed near Prairie dogs. They passed on the virus to these animals, which then gave it to humans when they were rehomed. : An individual in Texas is found to have been infected with monkeypox after returning to the U.S. from Nigeria.  A total of 200 people were monitored for infection, but after 21 days none had developed symptoms. : An individual tested positive for the virus after returning to Maryland from Nigeria. They did not pass the virus on to others. : A man is found to have been infected with the virus after returning to Massachusetts from Canada. In this outbreak more than 170 cases have been spotted across almost 25 states. New York City has been sent 1,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine to date — which is enough to jab just 500 residents. As well as rolling out doses through the clinic, it has also offered some to close contacts of known monkeypox cases to head off their infection. Other cities are also dishing out the jabs to close contacts. America has more than 74,000 doses of Jynneous and more than a million shots of ACAM2000 — which is also at least 85 percent effective against infection — in its arsenal, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a briefing on June 10. DailyMail.com has asked the CDC how many have been offered to each state, and how many have been rolled out to date. Another 300,000 Jynneous doses are expected to arrive in the U.S. within weeks, along with a further 500,000 before the end of the year. Both jabs are designed to trigger immunity against smallpox, but scientists say they will also work against monkeypox because the two viruses are very similar. Gay or bisexual men who got their monkeypox vaccines today emerged from the clinic jubilant and feeling 'lucky' to be among the few to get inoculated. One even exited telling a friend: 'We can make out tonight!' Marcello Santiago, 35, who owns a pet grooming store, was among those to get the vaccine today. He told DailyMail.com that he now felt protected and safe after getting the shot ahead of Pride. Caesar, 30, a fashion designer who did not give his last name was also among those to get the shot today. He said it 'felt great' to be inoculated and that he was looking forward to having a 'Prideful weekend'. Another couple, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com they came to get the vaccine because it seemed like the 'prudent' thing to do. They said they had been concerned about attending large events in Brooklyn this weekend without being jabbed. America has now recorded more than 170 cases of monkeypox, with New York City having the most infections out of any major city. Breaking down the figures by state, California has the most cases (48), followed by New York state (30) and Illinois (19). Today's roll out comes ahead of a weekend of Pride celebrations in the city, where the health department plans to hand out fliers at events to warn people over the risks of contracting the disease.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10950761/New-York-City-health-chiefs-blasted-minute-random-monkeypox-jab-roll-out.html,The Daily Mail
Australia's top doctor sounds the alarm over monkeypox and calls the disease an 'incident of national significance' - here's what it means for you,Ashley Nickel For Daily Mail Australia,2022-07-28 02:38:00,"Monkeypox  has been declared an 'incident of national significance' by Australia's top doctor, despite the nation racking up just 44 cases. Professor Paul Kelly's dramatic declaration on Thursday means the virus will now require national policies, intervention and public messaging - not unlike how Covid was dealt with. Australia's paltry number of cases is in stark comparison to the infections overseas, with it spreading throughout Europe and the US recording more than 1,000 new cases.  Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declared monkeypox as an 'incident of national significance' The declaration follows the  World Health Organization 's announcement on Wednesday that monkeypox virus is to be treated as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. More than 20,000 monkeypox cases have been recorded in 71 countries which have no previous record of the virus, including Australia where 44 cases have been reported. The virus has existed for many years but is usually contained to portions of west and central Africa where it is endemic, meaning it circulates among the population regularly.  The majority of Australia's cases have been reported in returned international travellers.  However, Mr Kelly reassured Australians the virus is far less harmful than Covid, with serious disease or death very unlikely. 'Monkeypox is also not transmitted in the same way as Covid and is far less transmissible,' he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared monkeypox a 'public health emergency of international concern' on Wednesday 'Monkeypox rash and flu-like symptoms are relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments.' Monkeypox can cause a wide range of symptoms that varying in severity from case to case. Symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. Previous 1 2 Next                   These symptoms are accompanied by a rash identified by pus-filled lesions that lasts between two and three weeks. The WHO says a person is no longer infectious once the lesions have 'crusted over, the scabs fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath'. The virus can spread from animals to people as well as person to person through body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has recommended two smallpox vaccines to protect against the monkeypox virus The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended the use of two smallpox vaccines to immunise the population against monkeypox in response to growing concerns. The two specific vaccines it recommends are third generation JYNNEOS and second generation ACAM2000. 'Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur, particularly in immunocompromised people,' it said.   ATAG advised supplies of the vaccine have been secured by some states and territories.  Professor Kelly said the majority of cases in Australia have been detected in men who have sex with men, which has also been reported overseas.  Monkeypox is a viral infection that spreads from animals to people and person to person.  The disease's most recognisable symptoms is a rash which can last two to three weeks. It can be found on the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and genital and/or anal regions of the body. The most common symptoms include a fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. The severity of symptoms changes from case to case. Some people will experience mild symptoms while others will feel them severely. People at higher risk of severe disease include people who are pregnant, children and the immunocompromised. Most cases of monkeypox heal on their own within a few weeks. However, severe cases of the disease can result in serious complications or death. Newborn babies, children and people with underlying immunity problems may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.  Complications from the disease can include secondary skin infections, pneumonia, confusion and eye problems.  Source:  World Health Organisation",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11056301/Australias-chief-medical-officer-sounds-alarm-monkeypox.html,The Daily Mail
Tucker Carlson pushes to rename monkeypox 'SCHLONG COVID' after woke New York City official asked WHO to change 'racist' title - as San Francisco declares public health emergency over virus,Joseph Michalitsianos For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-29 05:26:00,"Fox News  host Tucker Carlson jokingly announced plans to rename  monkeypox  'schlong COVID' after a woke official deemed the existing moniker racist.  Carlson announced the results of a  Twitter  poll on his Fox News show Thursday night, saying: 'So, monkeypox is about the coolest name ever for a disease. 'But they are changing the name because racism or something.' 'So, we had a vote,' Carlson then said: 'There was no ballot harvesting. You can trust our counting. And the new name for monkeypox is now officially – and we’re declaring it – schlong COVID. That won our audience election result with about 40% of the vote. So, let Rochelle Walensky at the  CDC  know.' Walensky is the director of the CDC, and one of the most public health officials in the United States' The term 'schlong COVID' appears to be a reference to the fact that around 95 per cent of people so-far infected by COVID have been gay men.    Carlson's Twitter poll had more than 26,000 votes, with schlong COVID the favorite among 39 per cent of respondents. Midterm Variant was runner-up, with 24 per cent, while Adam Schiffilis came third, with 20 per cent, and Hunter Hives was fifth, with 17 per cent.  Some progressive health officials have asked for monkeypox to have its name changed because the original title could be construed as racist. Last month, the World Health Organization said it would rename the disease, although it has yet to announce the replacement term.   The results are in. Monkeypox will now officially be called “Schlong Covid.”  pic.twitter.com/nEFZjvWAnV July 29, 2022 Tucker Carlson said Thursday the winner of his Twitter poll to rename 'monkeypox' was 'Schlong covid,' in reference to the high rate of gay men contracting the disease Monkeypox has exploded in the US, with New York and California becoming the hardest-hit states. San Francisco's mayor declared a state of emergency over the disease, in part because of calls from LGBTQ leaders The jokes came as San Francisco, a city with a high population of gay people, declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak of the disease.  Mayor London Breed's said her announcement would allow officials to cut through red tape and fight a public health crisis reminiscent of the AIDS epidemic that devastated the city in the 1980s.  Monkeypox generally resolves itself with mild symptoms, while AIDS had an almost 100 per cent death rate for the first 15 years of the epidemic, up until the mid-1990s.  Others have suggested that San Francisco is an overreaction.   'We are at a very scary place. And we don't want to be ignored by the federal government in our need. So many leaders of the LGBT community have also, weeks ago, asked for additional help and support and assistance,' said Mayor London Breed. The city is in 'desperate need of vaccines,' she said. Previous 1 2 Next                   The declaration, which takes effect Monday, was welcomed by gay advocates who have grown increasingly frustrated by what they called San Francisco's lackluster response to a virus that so far has affected primarily men who have sex with men, although anyone can get infected. 'San Francisco was at the forefront of the public health responses to HIV and COVID-19, and we will be at the forefront when it comes to monkeypox,' said state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents the city. 'We can´t and won´t leave the LGBTQ community out to dry.' The city has 281 cases, out of about 800 in California and 4,600 nationwide, according to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. A national shortage of vaccine has resulted in people waiting in line for hours for scarce doses, often to be turned away when the shots run out.  The United States has become the global epicenter of the  monkeypox  outbreak, overtaking  Spain  following a record-breaking 24 hours in which 1,048 new cases were confirmed.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on Wednesday that the uptick in cases was likely due to an increase in testing, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week. But the infection rate in the U.S. is below many other European countries including the UK and Germany (both at three per 100,000).  Experts fear the disease has already spilled over into more vulnerable groups, such as children under eight years old that health officials say are at high risk of severe disease.  Two children — in California and 'transiting through' D.C. — have tested positive for monkeypox to date, the CDC says.    America's response to monkeypox was slammed for being too slow to roll out tests and vaccinations at the start of the outbreak, especially to gay or bisexual men where most cases are being recorded.  No deaths have been registered to date but several patients have been hospitalized.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11060439/Tucker-Carlson-pushes-rename-monkeypox-Schlong-COVID.html,The Daily Mail
Could monkeypox be the next West Nile Virus? Scientist warns tropical disease could be next to establish itself in the US after other arrived in 1999 and gained a foothold within a year,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-22 18:02:00,"Monkeypox  may become endemic in the U.S. just like the West Nile Virus did after spilling over into the wild mosquito population two decades ago, an expert warns. Dr Bobbi Pritt, a pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in  Minnesota , told DailyMail.com a key similarity between the diseases was that both had spread under the radar before being detected. But she said monkeypox is likely to prove much easier to control because it was mostly being spread through sexual contact with infectious skin lesions, whereas the other is 'indiscriminately' transmitted by mosquitoes. The West Nile Virus (WNV) became endemic to the U.S. just a year after its arrival and is now the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the country — sparking tens of thousands of cases every year. About eight in ten people infected with the virus suffer no symptoms, but for those that do one in five face a fever, headache and vomiting while one in 150 can suffer encephalitis — inflammation of the brain. About 70 deaths related to the disease are recorded every 12-months. European health chiefs have warned monkeypox could also jump into the animal population, although add the risk remains 'very low'. There was a risk the tropical disease would in 2003 when it infected more than 40 prairie dogs, but the outbreak was eventually snuffed out. The warning comes after America recorded another 28 cases of monkeypox over this weekend and the Juneteenth across 23 states and Washington D.C. New Jersey, Indiana and Missouri were the latest states to detect the disease this weekend. The tally has now hit 142, but no deaths have been recorded in the U.S. or other countries currently facing an outbreak.  The above map shows states that have detected monkeypox (Red) in the current outbreak and those that are still to, the cumulative number of monkeypox cases every week day (left) and cases by state (right) The above map shows states that have detected West Nile virus this year. The incidence rate is per 100,000 people. Hawaii is yet to report its disease incidence The above map shows the states that have reported West Nile Virus in humans (dark green) and other animals (light green) since 2021. It shows the virus is now in every state of the country. Hawaii is yet to report its case count Warning that monkeypox could become established in the U.S. just like WNV, Pritt said: 'I would hesitate to say monkeypox is endemic yet, although it definitely has this potential.'  'It will be, however, easier to prevent monkeypox from spreading. 'They have quite different modes of transmission. WNV is spread through mosquito bites and is really quite indiscriminate. But monkeypox is mostly spread through sexual contact, at the moment particularly among men who have sex with men — although it could reach other populations. Previous 1 Next                   West Nile virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes, which can pick it up from birds. It was discovered in Uganda in the 1930s and is now found on almost every continent in the world. It reached the U.S. in 1999, likely on a shipment from the Middle East. The disease now triggers tens of thousands of cases every year, although most go unreported because eight in ten develop no symptoms. People who catch the disease generally do not show symptoms until three to 14 days later. Those that do develop warning signs tend to suffer flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and headaches. About one in 50 cases develop a severe illness, however, where they can face a coma, tremors and paralysis. About one in 150 patients could also suffer encephalitis— inflammation of the brain — which is life threatening. There is no specific treatment for West Nile Virus patients, but severely ill patients will be admitted to hospital for close monitoring. People with mild illness are recommended to get over-the-counter pain relieves to reduce their fever and other symptoms.  About 70 people die from the disease in the U.S. every year.   Sources:  CDC   'This could be stopped through practicing safe sex. 'There is more chance of stopping it than WNV. With WNV it can only really be stopped by wearing insect repellant.' American health chiefs took nearly two weeks to diagnose their first case of monkeypox in Massachusetts after standard swabs failed to detect other infections. They only decided to test the patient for the tropical virus after spotting alerts from Europe — led by the UK — over the outbreak there. In comparison, a WNV outbreak was spotted in New York City in late August after eight previously healthy people who lived within 16 miles of each other were struck down with encephalitis. The tropical disease has been known for decades after it was first spotted in the West Nile district of Northern Uganda in 1937. Since then it began to pop up in several other countries across the continent, parts of Asia and even in Romania, Europe. The disease arrived in the U.S. in 1999, likely on a shipment that had come from the Middle East — where Israel was also experiencing an outbreak at that time. It is not clear whether it was in geese or another bird that was imported or arrived via mosquitos that hitched a ride on a ship. Health officials became suspicious of its presence in late August when they spotted suggestive-cases in Queens. There also spotted many birds falling sick with a virus that had a high fatality rate. WNV is spread by mosquitoes to humans and birds, after the insect picks up the disease from another infected animal — which could well be an unwell bird. The following year they detected another outbreak of the disease, and within three years it had been recorded across as many as 44 states. It also triggered a major outbreak in 2002 when a total of 4,100 cases were detected including more than 2,000 people who suffered from encephalitis. There were also 284 fatalities. But Pritt said because so many people who catch the virus suffer no symptoms, it was likely the true case tally was in the tens of thousands. Other experts have also warned monkeypox could mimic WNV in becoming established in the country.  Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins in Maryland, previously told  CNN : 'It got seeded into the mosquito populations and... bird populations and was able to establish itself,' he said. But he also warned this was a far from inevitable outcome for monkeypox pointing out that '2003 was a good opportunity for it to happen' but that this did not occur. Monkeypox — which is native to West Africa — was first spotted in Europe in May, with cases traced back to unsafe sex at mass gatherings which took place in Spain and Belgium. It was then first detected in the U.S. a few weeks later in an individual who had recently returned from Canada, but the World Health Organization says it could have been spreading for years beforehand. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic             Lyme vaccine testing begins         Horrifying moment teenager fractures spine as mum films him         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Scientists train cameras on spiders to find out whether they sleep         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey     : A total of 47 people are found to have been infected with the virus after coming into contact with animals.  This was linked to a shipment of 800 rodents — including squirrels —  from Ghana to Texas. Some of the infected animals were then moved to Illinois and housed near Prairie dogs. They passed on the virus to these animals, which then gave it to humans when they were rehomed. : An individual in Texas is found to have been infected with monkeypox after returning to the U.S. from Nigeria.  A total of 200 people were monitored for infection, but after 21 days none had developed symptoms. : An individual tested positive for the virus after returning to Maryland from Nigeria. They did not pass the virus on to others. : A man is found to have been infected with the virus after returning to Massachusetts from Canada. Another case is currently being probed in New York City.  Most infections are being spotted among gay and bisexual men and linked back to international travel — including to Europe. But a growing number of cases are now being spotted with no links to other infections or international travel, suggesting the virus is already spreading under the radar in the country. It comes after New Jersey recorded its first suspected case of monkeypox in Jersey City yesterday, with a sample now being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. The patient was told to isolate at home, and contact tracing is now underway. They said on Instagram: 'The NJ Department of Health has confirmed the first case of monkeypox in Jersey City. Our health officials are working closely with the CDC. 'The local health department is conducting contact tracing to identify any individuals who may have been exposed to the individual. 'Most New Jersey residents are not at risk of infection with monkeypox.'  Globally, the CDC counts 2,525 total cases across 37 separate countries, with the United Kingdom leading the way with 574 and Spain in second place with 497 confirmed cases of the virus. Medical literature says that people infected with monkeypox experience flu-like symptoms within the first 21 days of catching the virus, followed by a rash that appears on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But this is rarely being observed in the current outbreak, with patients instead seeing rashes emerge on the genital areas before suffering any flu-like symptoms. Dr Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said: 'The disease is not spread through casual conversations, passing others in a grocery store, or touching things like door-knobs,' she said. 'All of the case we have seen to date in this outbreak have been related to direct contact.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10941781/Could-monkeypox-West-Nile-Virus.html,The Daily Mail
"Pregnant woman tests positive for monkeypox in America: Mother did not pass on virus to baby during birth and both are 'doing well', CDC says",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-27 16:24:00,"A pregnant woman has tested positive for  monkeypox  in the United States, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) chief has revealed. The woman has now given birth to her child, who does not appear to have caught the rash-causing virus from the mother. CDC released limited information on the case, including where in the US the woman was based. It's also unclear when the woman was infected, or exactly when she gave birth. Health officials said both were 'doing well', but the nation's top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that pregnant woman may face a 'profound risk' from the virus.  A maternity doctor told DailyMail.com that women in the early stages of pregnancy faced the biggest risk from monkeypox. The mother may have been in the final stages of her pregnancy when infected, as she recently gave birth.  The newborn received immune globin, an infusion of antibodies capable of fighting diseases including monkeypox, officials said. It is not clear what treatment the mother received. It is the first infection to be detected in a pregnant woman in the United States, and comes after America recorded its first two infections in children last week. The pediatric cases were unrelated and detected in California and Washington D.C. There are currently 3,591 monkeypox infections confirmed in America — the second biggest outbreak in the world behind Spain's 3,738 cases. Pictured above is the spread of monkeypox cases across the United States. New York has the most infections at present, followed by California and Illinois The U.S. currently has the second biggest monkeypox outbreak in the world, behind only Spain which was one of the first countries hit by the disease America has detected its first monkeypox case in a pregnant woman in the United States. Pictured above are images of cells infected with monkeypox virus (red dots) Dr John Brooks, chief medical officer in the CDC's monkeypox response, revealed the case during a webinar with the Infectious Diseases Society of America Saturday.   'There has been a case of a pregnant woman who delivered,' Brooks said. 'The neonate received the IG prophylactically (immune globin given to prevent disease). Both mom and baby are doing well.' CDC officials confirmed the case to DailyMail.com. Their website warns pregnant women are 'more likely to get seriously ill or die' from monkeypox. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 3,000 cases nationwide. : Two children and a pregnant women test positive for monkeypox, as the disease spreads to other groups. The children were in  California and traveling through Washington D.C., it was not clear where the woman was. Fauci — the top infectious diseases expert in the U.S. — warned in an interview about yesterday that pregnant women were among those more at risk from monkeypox. He told NPR: 'We've got to understand the modality of transmission, the manifestations, also the risk for people like children and pregnant women. There's really a profound risk. 'Right now, thank goodness, we have a report of only two cases in children, but they're all at risk populations.'  Dr Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine expert at Rosh Maternal and Fetal Medicine in New York, told DailyMail.com that pregnant women and their babies faced the greatest risk from monkeypox early in pregnancy because the babies organs were still developing, raising the risk of birth defects. In the later stages he said babies are more at risk of catching the virus because there is more blood flow to them, but less likely to suffer birth defects as most organs are already developed. He told DailyMail.com: 'If they catch the virus in the first ten weeks of pregnancy since the baby has just started to develop there is a greater risk of congenital abnormalities. '[But] in the third trimester there is more blood flow from placenta to the fetus and it's easier to get the virus.' Pregnant women who catch monkeypox can pass it on to their babies in the womb via the placenta. It can also be transmitted once a child is born through close contact — such as cuddles — and there may be a risk of it being passed on via the breastmilk. Roshan said immune globin would be administered to a pregnant woman who caught monkeypox to help fight off the infection. Asked how the parent became infected, Roshan said this was likely via close contact with an infected patient. He advised pregnant women to observe 'normal protocol' to avoid becoming infected. 'I would say they should just be careful with the contact,' he said. 'Stay away from people with rashes or fever, and follow personal hygiene.' The CDC says that babies born to pregnant women should be washed immediately after birth with wipes and soapy water. In guidance published this week, they add doctors should then decide whether to administer a vaccine to the child or antiviral. Infants must then be monitored for 21 days — during which time they should be looked after by a carer or family member — to ensure they have not caught the virus. Infected mothers should steer clear of their children until all the lesions triggered by monkeypox have scabbed over, and the scabs have fallen off. Dr John Brooks, chief medical officer in the CDC's monkeypox response, revealed the case in a pregnant woman during a webinar on Saturday. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's leading infectious diseases expert, said pregnant women were at 'profound risk' from the virus Medical literature shows monkeypox infections in pregnant women have previously led to miscarriage, stillbirth, early delivery and infection in the womb. But it is not clear how often these occur, because so few pregnant women have previously been infected. A 2017 study that tracked four pregnant women with the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo found two miscarried there babies and there was one fetal death.  Smallpox, monkeypox's now-eradicated cousin, was also more severe among pregnant women. Last week the CDC revealed America's first two cases of monkeypox had been detected in children as the virus spreads to other groups. One is a toddler from California, while the other is an infant who was travelling through Washington D.C. when the case was detected. Neither had contact with each other. It is thought both children likely caught the virus from 'household contacts', which includes people they live with and visitors to their home. Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak. They have received the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert has warned that the virus has likely already spread to other groups, but was not being detected among them yet due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that pregnant women are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11054073/Pregnant-woman-tests-positive-monkeypox-America.html,The Daily Mail
'Incredibly bad luck': California man says he caught COVID AND monkeypox at the same time - leaving him in excruciating pain,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-22 16:07:00,"A man in  California  says he has been infected with COVID and  monkeypox  at the same time in the first known case in America. Mitcho Thompson, a cannabis salesman in Sebastopol, tested positive for the pandemic virus in late June after feeling 'wiped out'. Days later, red lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which he said doctors diagnosed as monkeypox. Thompson was bedridden for weeks as trouble breathing and chills left him barely able to get up for water. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious diseases expert at Stanford University, said it was possible for someone to be infected by both viruses at once. He said Thompson had had 'incredibly bad luck'. It comes as America's monkeypox tally surges to 2,593 cases — the second highest tally in the world, right behind Spain, which has 3,125 cases. Mitcho Thompson, a cannabis salesman in Sebastopol, says he has been infected with COVID and monkeypox at the same time. He is pictured above at home He tested positive for COVID in late June after feeling under the weather. But a few days later, lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which doctors diagnosed as monkeypox Thompson — who also has a pet cat — revealed his diagnosis with both diseases during an interview with  NBC Bay Area . He told the broadcaster: 'The COVID was first, and that's what made it really weird because I did not actually realize I had monkeypox until I started breaking out [in lesions]. 'The doctor was very certain that I have monkeypox and that I have both. Previous 1 Next             America still has the 'opportunity' to contain monkeypox, the director of the CDC has insisted as the cases tally rises to the second-highest in the world. Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed in an interview today the Government's response is growing stronger every day. She added: 'I think we still have an opportunity to contain this.'  But her comments come as the United States recorded another 270 infections, taking its tally to 2,593. This is the second-highest in the world, behind only Spain which has recorded more than 3,000. America's response to the outbreak has been slow from the outset, with the CDC taking weeks to get testing up and running. In the early days of the outbreak it was carrying out less than 100 a day. The federal government has also been slammed for failing to roll out vaccines quickly, which public health experts say would have helped to slow the spread of the virus.  'That was the question, could I get them both at the same time, and he said ""yes, yes, yes."" ' Thompson said both viruses left him feeling 'really sick.' 'And the worst of it was honestly was just when I could barely get out of bed, and you could barely like get a drink of water.' A COVID infection triggers flu-like symptoms including a fever, cough, shortness of breath and muscle aches. A monkeypox infection also triggers these warning signs in the early stages, which then develop into a rash that spreads across the body. Thompson said he tested positive for COVID, however, ruling out the possibility that his flu-symptoms were just the result of monkeypox. It was not clear how Thompson caught monkeypox or COVID, or what treatments he had received. Health authorities are offering antivirals like Paxlovid to COVID patients to help fight their infection, and vaccines to those who test positive for monkeypox which they say can reduce symptoms. Asked whether it was possible to catch COVID and monkeypox at the same time, Winslow said: 'It's certainly not impossible for that to occur, it's just, you know, incredibly bad luck.  'But they are very different viruses.  'Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses that smallpox is.  'One of the small good things about monkeypox is it is really transmitted almost exclusively by very close contact and not necessarily sexual contact but certainly very close contact.' Monkeypox belongs to the orthopox family of viruses, which tend to trigger rashes in those they infect. On the other hand, COVID is part of the Coronaviruses family — which get their name due to the spike proteins that surround them 'like a crown'. Another key difference is that COVID transmits primarily through droplets expelled into the air, whereas monkeypox only does this in very rare cases, when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It came as the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) insisted America still had the 'opportunity' to contain monkeypox. Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed in an interview Friday that the government's response is growing stronger every day. 'I think we still have an opportunity to contain this,' she said.  But her comments came as the US cases tally rose to the second-highest globally, and after other experts warned the disease is likely now out of control.

"America will have biggest monkeypox outbreak in world within days: Cases in the U.S. surge to nearly 3,500",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-26 16:18:00,"America will have the biggest  monkeypox  outbreak in the world within days, statistics suggest amid ramped up testing that is picking up the disease in areas where it had previously spread 'uninterrupted'. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said 3,487 cases of the rash-causing virus had been detected as of Tuesday, behind only  Spain  with 3,596 confirmed infections. But by population — which takes into account the U.S. having seven-times more people — America's has about one case per 100,000 people compared to Spain's tally of seven per 100,000. Its infection rate is also below many other European countries including the UK and Germany (both at three per 100,000). The U.S. may also now be carrying out more tests for the disease than its European neighbors — meaning it is more likely to detect cases, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week.  Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned that it was 'reasonable' to suggest America's cases tally would 'outpace' those in other nations. He said the surge was in part down to the surge in testing, which was detecting monkeypox in areas where it had previously spread under the radar. Experts fear the disease has already spilled over into more vulnerable groups, such as children under eight years old that health officials say are at high risk of severe disease. Two children — in California and 'transiting through' D.C. — have tested positive for monkeypox to date, the CDC says.  America's response to monkeypox was slammed for being too slow to roll out tests and vaccinations at the start of the outbreak, especially to gay or bisexual men where most cases are being recorded. No deaths have been registered to date but several patients have been hospitalized. The above graph shows the cumulative tally of cases in the US, and the current total compared to that in other nations worldwide. The US only reports cases during weekdays, and not at weekends. Its latest figure is for July 25, while that for Spain — which has the largest outbreak — is for July 22. The above map shows monkeypox cases across the U.S., as reported to the CDC. Only four states — Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming — are yet to pick up the virus The above graph shows the cumulative tally for monkeypox cases in the five countries that have reported the most infections in the world. It reveals Spain has the most cases, followed by the United States and Germany But when the data is shown per population — as revealed by the above graph — it shows the outbreak in Spain far outpaces that in America. The U.S. has about one case per 100,000 people, putting at the bottom of the five countries with the most cases reported to date. Spain's outbreak is far ahead of that in other nations             Lyme vaccine testing begins         Horrifying moment teenager fractures spine as mum films him         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Scientists train cameras on spiders to find out whether they sleep         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey     The United States has been updating its monkeypox tally every weekday, with the latest figures up to July 25.  But Spain has been publishing its tallies every two to three days, with the latest data only from the date July 22. On July 19, Spain reported 3,125 cases. DailyMail.com averaged the daily rise in cases over the latest seven days available to calculate how fast they were ticking up every 24 hours. This showed the U.S. is currently recording about 216 monkeypox cases a day on average, while in Spain 108 per day are being detected. Previous 1 Next                   Washington D.C. has postponed its roll out of second doses of the monkeypox, joining New York City. Its Department of Health revealed the move Monday, citing 'very limited' supplies of the jabs and a fast increase in cases. They said: 'This is extremely important because getting more individuals vaccinated with their first shot will help us contain the virus.' America is rolling out the two dose Jynneous vaccine to fight monkeypox, with the second dose due to be given four weeks after the first. But some experts say it is possible to widen the gap — as was done with the Covid vaccine in other countries — to ensure more people can be inoculated first. A Food and Drug Administration vaccines adviser has warned against the move, however, saying no studies have been carried out to determine whether it will ensure the jabs are still effective. Both New York City and Washington D.C. are offering monkeypox jabs to gay or bisexual men with multiple sexual partners. Based on these figures, America's tally could rise above Spain's as early as Saturday this week. It is unlikely that another European nation will surge ahead as experts say many — including the UK — are now seeing their outbreak start to peak. Asked whether the U.S. would soon have the worst outbreak, Hanage said: 'The U.S. was slow to kick off widespread testing, and so now is detecting transmission chains that have been carrying on uninterrupted for some time. We don't know how much increased awareness, especially in the core communities of gay and bisexual men, will slow transmission down. 'But it is reasonable to suggest that the U.S. case count will continue to grow and will outpace the outbreak's elsewhere.' Spain is at the center of Europe's monkeypox outbreak, being among the first country's to report the disease — with early cases linked to unsafe sex among gay or bisexual men at a venue outside the country's capital, Madrid, and a Pride event in the Canary Islands. Since then the vast majority of cases have been detected in the same group, but some have been spotted in women — often those living with gay or bisexual men. A three-year-old also tested positive for the virus. Health authorities in the country have rolled out vaccines to close contacts in order to curb cases, but there have been problems getting hold of doses. Spain — like the U.S. — is using the Jynneous vaccine, but only had 200 doses available in early July. It has said more doses will be ordered, but has not specified a number. In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected. Hotspots New York City and Washington D.C. are rolling out vaccines against the virus to gay or bisexual men with multiple partners in two weeks to put a lid on the virus, but these programs have hit a brick wall with too few doses being supplied by the Federal Government. Both cities are now delaying second doses, due four weeks after the first, due to demand. A total of 5million vaccines have been ordered so far, on top of the more than one million that were available when the program began.  Testing has also been ramped up after it was slammed early on for the stringent guidance on which samples could be tested leading to just 23 swabs being checked for the virus a day early in the outbreak. Five commercial labs have been brought onboard now with a combined capacity for about 80,000 swabs per week.  Daily tallies have rocketed since, with the biggest daily increase yet reported last Thursday with 298 cases spotted within 24 hours. Over Friday, Saturday and Sunday another 596 cases were recorded — or 198 per day —, CDC figures show, but capacity is generally lower on weekends because many people are away from their desks. Breaking the data down by area shows New York City currently has the largest outbreak at 1,040 confirmed infections according to its Department of Health. The CDC says the state has 990 infections at present. It was followed by California, at 356, and Illinois, with 341. Only four states — Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming — are yet to detect a single infection with the disease.  It is not clear whether other states — alongside New York — are preparing to start vaccinating gay or bisexual men where most cases are being detected to get a handle on the outbreak. Monkeypox is normally confined to West Africa, but earlier this year it was picked up at a Pride festival in Spain. Since then more than 40 countries worldwide — mostly in Europe — have spotted cases of the disease, which are mostly among gay or bisexual men. Unlike in previous outbreaks, the disease appears to mostly be spreading via sexual contact with lesions — which allow transmission — initially appearing on the genital and anal regions. Experts say the disease has likely already spilled over into other groups, however, which are more at risk.

Monkeypox has killed its first victim in Europe as Spain confirms a fatality just a week after WHO confirmed it as a global health emergency,Gerard Couzens for MailOnline,2022-07-29 20:09:00,"Spain  has confirmed its first  monkeypox  death - and Europe's first fatality from the virus.  The five previous reported deaths were all in African nations.  Spain's Ministry of Health confirmed the fatality today as it revealed 4,298 cases have so far been notified.  It gave no details about the person who had died and when it had happened. Only 64 of the confirmed cases in Spain have been women. Earlier this month when the number of confirmed cases stood at just over 3,000 in Spain, it was identified as the monkeypox world leader.  The earliest cases in May were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria.  Last week the World Health Organisation declared monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed.  Monkeypox has affected more than 16,000 people across 75 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Previous 1 2 Next                   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee.  It was the first time the chief of the U.N. health agency has taken such an action. 'We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,' Tedros said. 'I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members of the committee,' he added. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. Director General Dr Tedros said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was 'high'.  The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio.   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (above) made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee Although monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spread beyond the continent or to move widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of individual outbreaks in Europe, North America and elsewhere.  Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11062969/Monkeypox-claims-victim-Europe-Spain-confirms-4-200-cases.html,The Daily Mail
Gay and bisexual men WILL be offered monkeypox vaccine in targeted rollout: UK steps up efforts to thwart outbreak amid warning it could get 10 TIMES bigger as health chiefs log another 200 cases,Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-06-21 13:49:00,"Gay and bisexual men who are at a 'high risk' of catching monkeypox are set to be offered a vaccine to protect against the infection, health chiefs announced today.  Nearly 800 cases of the virus, which is usually only spotted in Africa, have been reported in the UK. Almost all infections so far have been spotted in men who have sex with men. In a bid to stem case numbers, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today confirmed some gay and bisexual men would be offered the Imvanex vaccine — which is 85 per cent effective — to control the outbreak. Under the plans, which come from the same experts who advised on the Covid vaccine rollout, medics will offer the jab to men who have multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues. Until now, the jab was only offered to confirmed cases and their close contacts under a strategy called ring vaccination, which has been proven to work in other outbreaks. Experts told MailOnline a fortnight ago the next sensible step if infections continued to spiral would be to widen the vaccination programme in a targeted rollout to more men who have sex with men, anyone visiting a sexual health clinic and NHS staff. It comes as Covid-weary Britons were today warned that the monkeypox outbreak could get 10 times bigger by experts behind gloomy models used to justify lockdown restrictions. The modelling suggested, however, that any surge in cases among groups other than gay and bisexual men was 'unlikely'. Meanwhile, British health bosses reported another 219 infections today — the highest daily toll — bringing the UK total to 793. London is the country's virus hotspot. Dozens of countries, including the US, Spain and Germany, have been struck by the outbreak — the biggest ever detected outside of Africa to date. Almost all of infections so far have been spotted in the men who have sex with other men community.

Until now, the jab was only offered to confirmed cases and their close contacts under a strategy called ring vaccination, which has been proven to work in other outbreaks              Mother's fury after son crashes car on the driveway         Horrifying moment teenager fractures spine as mum films him         Ryan Giggs arrives at court for fourth day of domestic assault trial         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Huge queues of cars as Russians attempt to leave Crimea         British village of Northend struggling with water shortages         Incredible video of a fire tornado in northwestern Los Angeles         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         Paul Green makes his last public appearance at Sharks Old Boys day         Shocking footage emerges of cars and vans filmed smashing into each other         Volodymyr Zelensky vows to end the war where it began, in Crimea     Previous 1 Next                                     : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa.

Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   The UKHSA today published a strategy which set out that some gay and bisexual men at 'higher risk' of exposure to monkeypox should be offered a vaccine to control the outbreak. Officials have not put a number on how many men will be included in the rollout. Anyone can catch the virus, which is spread by close contact with an infected person. But most cases in the ongoing surge are among the 'sexual networks' of men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox, which will be renamed because of claims that it is discriminatory towards Africa, is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection. But it is thought to be the main mode of transmission in the ongoing outbreak.  The virus, first discovered in lab monkeys in the 1950s, can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone who is infected. Under the plans, endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), those eligible for  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — a pill that protects against HIV — will also be eligible for the vaccine. This includes people who do not always use condoms during sex and are likely to continue not using them, as well as sex workers or their clients who report having unprotected sex. NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted. As well as gay and bisexual men, the list of NHS staff eligible for the jab is also being expanded. Healthcare workers caring for monkeypox patients in specialist high consequence infectious disease (HICD) wards are already offered the jab. But now staff in other hospitals designed to care for monkeypox patients will also be offered the jab, as well as workers in laboratories that test for the virus. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: 'Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  'By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. 'Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet.' The UKHSA is urging all Britons to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have had close contact with a new partner. Those with symptoms are told to avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre. Alex Sparrowhawk, health promotion specialist at HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'This targeted vaccination programme is a positive move forward while the data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK.' Robbie de Santos, director of communications and external affairs at LGBT charity Stonewall said it welcomed the vaccine being offered to those who are most at risk of catching the virus. He said: 'It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others. Let's help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season.' It comes as the UKHSA today confirmed Britain's outbreak has grown by 38 per cent since Friday to 793. Among the 766 cases with confirmed addresses, 498 are in London, 37 are in the South East and 26 are in the North West. All other regions have logged 20 cases or fewer. Public Health Scotland on Sunday said that all cases appear to be 'generally mild and not life-threatening' with no reported deaths in the UK to date. Monkeypox cases have been aged 37, on average, health bosses said.   Meanwhile, scientists behind the monkeypox modelling that warned of another 10,000 cases include Professor John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist who was among the most outspoken SAGE members during the Covid outbreak. Two other study authors are also Government advisers, sitting on the notorious SPI-M modelling committee. It warned of up to 6,000 deaths per day in the run-up to the Christmas just gone, despite the actual peak being 20 times lower. Without tough interventions, they also warned Omicron could potentially cause daily hospitalisations to breach 10,000 — quadruple the figure that happened in reality. In their latest modelling, Professor Edmunds and other LSHTM scientists looked at how monkeypox could keep spreading. Their estimates were based on sexual partnership data in the UK, gathered from a survey of 45,000 people that is conducted every decade. At the time of the modelling on May 31, 728 confirmed and suspected cases had been reported worldwide in more than 25 countries. Since then, almost 3,000 infections have been logged worldwide. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious The results, published on pre-print website  medRxiv , show that without interventions or changes in sexual behaviour, it is 'highly likely' that a 'major outbreak' would be seen among men who have sex with men. A major outbreak was defined as being at least another 10,000 cases, on top of the ones already detected. The modellers said their findings, which have not been peer-reviewed, show that a 'small fraction' of individuals with a 'disproportionately large' number of sexual partners could explain the 'sustained growth' of monkeypox among men who have sex with men. Monkeypox likely always had the risk of 'substantial transmission potential' among this community, their paper states.  But it has not been able to take off because too few cases have been logged outside of Africa over the past few decades, they said. However, the team said sustained transmission in other groups is 'unlikely'.  But they noted that between 10 and 10,000 extra cases could be spotted outside of the men who have sex with men community if lots of this group become infected. The monkeypox R rate — a term made famous during the pandemic, which reflects the number of people an infected person passes the virus onto — may be 'substantially greater than one' which could make it challenging to contain the outbreak, their paper states.  Contact tracing and vaccinating close contacts of infected people — the approaches used in the UK — only work if almost all contacts of an infected person are identified, they warned. They said experts should identify 'acceptable and effective' ways of preventing transmission among men with the highest number of sexual partners who could have a 'disproportionate effect on transmission overall'. Monkeypox is usually mild and has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning it can take three weeks for the tell-tale symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. It can, however, kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. But the milder strain causing the current outbreak has a case-fatality rate of around one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.  No deaths linked with the ongoing outbreak have yet been reported. Outside of the UK, Spain (497), Germany (421) and Portugal (297) have logged the most infections. Experts have warned monkeypox could become endemic among animals in Europe, as it is in parts of Nigeria, if the virus spreads to pets and wildlife. This would make animals a permanent reservoir of the virus that could infect humans, triggering sporadic outbreaks.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10937773/Monkeypox-outbreak-10-TIMES-bigger-Scientists-warn-major-epidemic-highly-likely.html,The Daily Mail
"Two MORE children test positive for monkeypox: Indiana health chiefs confirm cases which take national toll among kids to four, including a toddler in California and baby in DC",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-02 15:45:00,"Two children have tested positive for  monkeypox  in  Indiana , state health officials have revealed bringing the U.S. tally among youngsters to four. The Indiana Department of Health announced the infections, but refused to give any further information citing privacy concerns. They join a toddler in  California  who has caught the virus, and a baby who tested positive while traveling through Washington D.C. A pregnant woman was also found to have been infected last week. It raises concerns because children under the age of eight years are at higher risk of a more severe monkeypox infection. More than 5,800 cases have been spotted in America so far — the biggest outbreak in the world, mostly among men and gay or bisexual individuals. But experts warn the disease will likely spill over into other groups because it only requires physical touch to be passed on. No deaths have yet been recorded in the United States, but ten fatalities have been registered worldwide including four out of Africa. The two in Spain are reported to be among young men.   The above map shows countries that have detected monkeypox (yellow) and that have confirmed a monkeypox death (red). There have been ten fatalities globally so far Revealing the cases in children last week, the state added: 'No additional information about the cases will be released at this time due to patient privacy.' They did not say whether they had been hospitalized, or what treatments they were being offered.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed the first two cases in children a fortnight ago, but said both were 'doing well' at the time. DailyMail.com has asked for an update. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 5,000 cases nationwide. : Monkeypox cases are detected in children and a pregnant woman in the U.S., in a sign it is spreading to other groups. It is thought they most likely became infected from 'household contacts', which can include family members as well as visitors to where they live. Dr Rochelle Walensky said both the children had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected currently. The two youngsters were receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with how the virus matures. Monkeypox infections have been mostly confined to adult men — who were behind more than 99 percent of total cases last week. But experts are repeatedly warning the virus will spill over into other groups because it only requires physical contact with lesions to transmit. This has sparked concern if it spreads to children, because evidence suggests they are at risk of more severe disease. The World Health Organization warns that children — alongside older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of youngsters with monkeypox die from the disease, although this depends on the strain they catch. Announcing the case in Indiana, state health commissioner Dr Kris Box said: 'Monkeypox does not easily spread through brief casual contact, but it's important to remember that anyone can be affected if they are a close contact of a positive case. 'Hoosiers who believe they may have been exposed or who develop symptoms consistent with monkeypox are urged to contact a healthcare provider.' Indiana has the 17th biggest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, with 54 infections recorded to date. But this has grown rapidly from two weeks ago, when there were just 11 cases detected. The biggest outbreak is in New York City where 1,390 cases have now being detected followed by California (827) and Illinois (520). Neither has declared cases in children.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11073095/Two-children-catch-monkeypox-Indiana-health-officials-reveal.html,The Daily Mail
CDC launches Emergency Activation Center to combat growing monkeypox outbreak in US as cases hit 244 with 43 added over Pride weekend,Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor,2022-06-28 20:51:00,"The  CDC  has launched an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to combat the nation's budding  monkeypox  outbreak, the agency announced Tuesday. It comes as the nation's case tally reached 244, including 43 that were added to the ledger after the weekend. No U.S. deaths have been tied to the virus. Some experts fear that true case figures are even higher than reported, as the virus is spreading uncirculated as those infected may miss signs that they have it and the nation's testing infrastructure is relatively limited. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched the EOC to serve as the center point in coordinating the response to the virus in a bid to expand the response to the virus. A move of this type signals that the agency worries that the outbreak could continue to grow and even get out of hand - like it has in some European countries - if the response is not fortified. The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days The CDC has launched an Emergency Activation Center to combat the rise of monkeypox in the U.S. It will have more than 300 dedicated staff members (file photo) Previous 1 Next             'Today, CDC continues to lean forward with an aggressive public health response to the monkeypox outbreak by activating its Emergency Operations Center (EOC),' the agency wrote in a statement. The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. 'This action stands up the CDC’s command center for monitoring and coordinating the emergency response to monkeypox and mobilizing additional CDC personnel and resources. CDC’s activation of the EOC allows the agency to further increase operational support for the response to meet the outbreak’s evolving challenges.' The agency says that more than 300 staff members will work within the EOC. It comes just after the final weekend of Pride month, which many feared would spark outbreaks of the virus that has spread across communities of gay and bisexual men around the world. It is likely that many cases of monkeypox are also going undiagnosed due to a lack of testing, or being written off as another infection. Last weekend America recorded its biggest two-day rise in monkeypox infections since the outbreak was detected last month. The rash-causing virus is likely spreading under the radar as well. Several cases now not linked to a previously known infection or international travel, and experts have warned that poor surveillance methods are leaving populations vulnerable. Nationwide, California has the biggest outbreak, with 67 cases, followed by New York with 37 and Florida and Illinois with 27 each. Globally cases now top more than 4,000 across about 60 countries, but only one death has been recorded to date in an individual from Nigeria. While cases are mostly being detected among men who have sex with men at present, there are fears it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk from the disease, such as the immunocompromised. The disease is primarily passed on through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions, leading to fears it could also become entrenched as a sexually transmitted disease. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization declined the declare the virus a global health emergency.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tells young Republicans to add a MONKEY emoji to their social media profile because of monkeypox and calls it ‘a new global pandemic’ in speech where lawmaker labeled herself a ‘Christian Nationalist’,"Elizabeth Elkind, Politics Reporter In Tampa, Florida For Dailymail.Com",2022-07-23 21:57:00,"Firebrand  GOP  Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia told an audience of young  conservatives  on Saturday to add a monkey emoji to their social media profiles in light of the World Health Organization's emergency declaration on  monkeypox . She also labeled herself a 'Christian Nationalist,' which earned appreciative noises from the crowd at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Tampa, Florida. Greene gave a brief but fiery speech on the second day of the conference. Her popularity among Republican teens and young adults was clearly evident in the standing ovation she received both before and after her speech. 'We have a new global pandemic, have you heard about this? Monkeypox, that's right,' the congresswoman said. 'It's the newest thing.' 'Listen, you guys have to update your social media, right next to your Ukraine flag emoji and your vaccine shot emoji, you need to make sure you have a monkey emoji.' She appeared to be taking a shot at left-wing Twitter personalities who add emojis to their profiles to show allegiance with certain causes. Greene joked, 'I want you all to be with it, you can't be behind, you have to have full outrage over everything that the left and the media tells you.' Just a few chuckles could be heard from the crowd.  It comes hours after WHO declared the global monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. Nearly 3,000 cases have been reported in the US so far - including, recently, two children.   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got a standing ovation both before and after her remarks at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit Her comment about monkeypox came hours after the World Health Organization labeled it a global emergency A line that was more warmly received was Greene proudly labeling herself a 'Christian Nationalist.' Being a nationalist, she said, means 'you care about your country.'  'That's not a bad word,' she said as the audience cheered. 'That's actually a good thing. There's nothing wrong with leading with your faith.'  She added that leading with that Christian Nationalist mentality is 'what the Republican Party should be about' and encouraged the millennial and Gen Z Republicans to lead with their 'proud Christian faith.' 'If we do not live our lives and vote like we are nationalists - caring about our country, and putting our country first and wanting that to be the focus of our federal government - if we do not lead that way, then we will not be able to fix it,' Greene said. Previous 1 Next                         Greene also blasted her colleagues in Washington for caring more about 'corporate welfare' than 'American workers,' earning appreciative applause from the crowd. But the audience erupted in cheers when Greene called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  'Our government right now, the Biden administration, is completely corrupt, and I'm going to tell you something right now - Joe Biden should be impeached,' she said. 'And I'm also going to add, so should Nancy Pelosi.' Greene's call to jail the president's son, Hunter Biden, prompted chants of 'Lock him up' that caught on across the nearly-full room. A cardboard sign with the likeness of former President Donald Trump is viewed during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, Friday, July 22 Hundreds of young Republican voters descended on Tampa for the multi-day event   'I think we should,' she added after the chants subsided, before pivoting to making fun of her political rival Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'Speaking of getting locked up, let's talk about someone that was arrested just this past week - AOC.' The progressive New York lawmaker was arrested with 16 other House Democrats during a pro-abortion protest outside of the Supreme Court on Tuesday. She sparked widespread mockery when images and videos of her arrest appear to show Ocasio-Cortez holding her hands behind her back as if she was handcuffed - despite pumping one fist in the air to supporters in a show of solidarity. Ocasio-Cortez has denied faking being handcuffed. 'You don't play in the road like AOC and her girlfriends, right?' Greene asked the crowd. 'They were out there playing in the road, laying in the road in front of the Supreme Court and the Capitol Police had to tell him to get off the road. But what did they do? They got arrested.' Of the handcuffs controversy, she added: 'See? It's all fake, it's a great big lie.' 'Because you know what? That's what a lot of people in Congress are. They're great, big liars. And that's what we have to change,' Greene said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11042421/Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-calls-Christian-Nationalist-speech-young-Republican-gathering.html,The Daily Mail
"Strikes, thunderstorms, and now MONKEYPOX! Glastonbury revellers are warned of skin-to-skin contact danger by health chiefs as the music event returns for the first time in three years after Covid delays",Kaya Terry,2022-06-23 02:13:00,"Jubilant festivalgoers at Glastonbury have been warned of skin-to-skin contact and the danger of  monkeypox  by health chiefs as the music event returns for the first time in three years after Covid delays.  To the dismay of many festival-goers, showers and thunderstorms are predicted from Friday onwards, and the event coincides with three days of planned major rail strikes over rail workers' pay, leading to travel disruption for people making their way to Worthy Farm in Somerset. The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) has now urged the 20,000 people who are set to descend on the site for the five-day-long festival to be mindful of the disease as case numbers in the UK continue to rise.  So far 793 people in the UK have tested positive for the virus, with the vast majority of these cases being found in England, and in gay and bisexual men. Earlier this month the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) warned that festivals in Europe this summer could act as super spreading events for the disease.  Thousands of people queued at the entrance to the farm yesterday morning, eager to start five days of partying and ready to enjoy a star-studded line-up of music acts including headliners Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar.  And the first day saw crowds bathed in glorious sunshine, as the British summer welcomed revellers back to Somerset for the first time since 2019. People both young and old and from all parts of the UK - and some even from abroad - descended on the farm near Shepton Mallet, powering through the ongoing national rail strike that has paralysed train networks across the country. Dressed in brightly coloured clothes and enjoying the festival atmosphere, those who got there early showed no signs of letting the strike ruin their good mood. The festival's main stage will not open until Friday, with headliner  Billie Eilish  set for the iconic Pyramid Stage followed by Sir  Paul McCartney  on Saturday and rapper Kendrick Lamar bringing the event to a close on Sunday. However, DJs and live music is planned from today for eager fans who have arrived at the site early - as more than 200,000 people are expected to descend at Glastonbury over the next two days. A couple embrace in the sunset at Worthy Farm in Somerset yesterday as the first day of Glastonbury Festival 2022 got underway  Festival goers, dressed in suitable clothing for the glorious sunshine, walk through the camp as they look to soak in the atmosphere Hundreds of people gathered to sit on one of the hills at the festival as they made the most of the sunshine before forecasted rain later this weekend Festivalgoers take advantage of the Great Western Railway network to head to Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm Festivalgoers near the festival sign on day one of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 22 At the first Glastonbury since 2019, Ed proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea as the sun begins to set on the first day of the festival Revellers watch the sun go down on the first official day of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 22 Thousands of people arrived at the festival yesterday, with more than 20,000 people expected to attend the five-day-long extravaganza The Pyramid stage, which will host the likes of Sir Paul McCartney and Billie Eilish over the weekend, looms in the distance amid a sea of tents Festivalgoers gather around Pride-themed artwork at Worthy Farm on the first day of the first Glastonbury Festival since 2019 Festivalgoers wasted no time setting up their tents in the massive campsite, which is expected to host around 20,000 people throughout the weekend Groups of friends from all over the UK have come to the festival, powering through the national rail strike which has caused travel chaos But those in attendance have been warned to enjoy themselves responsibly and be mindful of the increasing number of monkeypox cases in the UK.  A spokesperson for the UKHSA said: 'Festival-goers should also be aware that there is currently transmission of monkeypox in the UK. 'The infection mainly spreads between people through direct (skin to skin) contact, including sexual contact, or close contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with the monkeypox virus. 'If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don't go to events, meet with friends, or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. 'If you have been advised to self-isolate, please continue to do so and you should not attend the festival without prior clearance from the relevant health authority.' Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Europe regional director, said earlier this month that the resumption of international travel and events such as festivals had allowed disease to spread.  'Rapid, amplified transmission has occurred in the context of the recent lifting of pandemic restrictions on international travel and events,' he said. He added the current outbreak was the 'largest and most geographically widespread' ever reported, with Europe at its 'epicentre'.  'Many – but not all cases – report fleeting and/or multiple sexual partners, sometimes associated with large events or parties,' he added. The glorious sunshine was welcomed by festivalgoers who might have been expecting the classic British summer weather of torrential rain. This woman raises her shirt as she gets sprayed with water by a festival worker to cool down People both young and old have come to the festival. This young boy sits on a woman's shoulders on the first day of this year's event The classic sight of people in fancy-dress has also returned for this year's festival, with this man dressed a zebra and carrying a toy giraffe This couple also came in fancy dress, sensibly covering their heads from the worst of the sun with their mushroom-style hats Festivalgoers gather round a campfire as the sun goes down over Somerset on the first day of this year's Glastonbury Festival  This group of female festivalgoers seemed to be having a blast as the sun went down on the first day of Glastonbury yesterday Festivalgoers have already been queuing in traffic since dawn for the first day of Glastonbury after the chaotic rail strike forced many to camp overnight at the four-day Somerset festival. Organisers told fans they could begin parking at the site from 4pm on Tuesday after trains and Tube services were disrupted for a second day running - forcing revellers to get to Worthy Farm early to beat the rush.  The founder of the Somerset festival Michael Eavis was pictured officially opening the gate to Glastonbury this morning marking the official start of the four-day music spectacular. The festival is returning for its 50th anniversary after a three-year hiatus due to Covid-19.  Eavis and his daughter Emily were stood at one of the festival's many entry points and clapped as the first attendees entered the site. Eavis, 86, told those entering the gates: 'This is going to be the best show in town. Wait and see. You better believe it.' Huge crowds of revellers were pictured sitting on camping chairs by metal railings as they secured their spot in line to the entrance of the festival.

The music event has opened its gates this morning, signalling its return for the first time in three years after it was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Lauren Laverne on 6 Music, she said of the gates opening: 'I mean, I'm still recovering because the build up has just been so long, we've never had a build up as long as this, obviously. 'We've never all collectively been through such an extreme time together, so it's like, to actually be able to see people there and welcome them in and just watch them streaming in and just running to pitch their tents up and fill the fields, it's just an amazing feeling.'

'Everyone is appreciating it so, so much... everyone is just still beaming because they are so pleased, everyone is so chuffed to be back so it's a totally unique atmosphere, I just can't wait to get everyone in here.' Shortly before the gates opened, radio host Jo Whiley said Glastonbury is the 'ultimate festival' and that Sir Paul McCartney's headlining slot on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday night is a 'very, very important and significant performance'. The former Beatle, 80, will become the music festival's oldest ever solo headliner when he takes to the stage this weekend.

Ahead of the five-day event, meteorologist Tom Morgan from the Met Office told the PA news agency, this year's weather outlook promises to be 'one of two halves'. Temperatures could reach 27C at the 900-acre site - 9C higher than usual - in the lead-up to the world-famous event. However, the mud synonymous with Glastonbury is still set to make an appearance, with showers and thunderstorms predicted from Friday onwards. To the dismay of many festival-goers the event coincides with three days of planned major rail strikes over rail workers' pay, leading to travel disruption for people making their way to Worthy Farm. Just 60% of trains will run across Wednesday, with walkouts planned for Thursday and Saturday. This year's much-anticipated festival, running from Wednesday to Sunday, will host huge stars from Diana Ross and Sir Paul McCartney, to Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Olivia Rodrigo.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10943621/Glastonbury-revellers-warned-monkeypox-danger-health-chiefs-event-returns-three-years.html,The Daily Mail
"NYC opens THREE mass vaccination centers for monkeypox with each able to dish out 1,400 doses a day — but jabs STILL run out within an hour: US cases of tropical virus reach 2,891",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-25 19:09:00,"New York City  unveiled three mass vaccination centers for  monkeypox  Friday with each able to dish out 1,400 doses a day — but appointments at each site ran out within an hour, signaling the high demand for the jabs. The vaccine centers are based in Brooklyn, Bronx and the Queens and began rolling out doses this Sunday. They will roll out the rest this weekend. The Big Apple is running the largest inoculation drive for gay or bisexual men in the country, with only Washington D.C. also aiming to jab the group. Those who got at the Brooklyn center yesterday said they had just 'got lucky', adding they knew many others waiting for doses. There is mounting concern that monkeypox could spill over into other groups — including children, older adults and pregnant women — which are more vulnerable to the disease. It does not require sex to be transmitted, and can be spread through physical contact such as touching others or a hug. Cases in America are starting to surge as well, reaching 2,891 over the weekend as officials fear case counts are only picking up a fraction of the true number of Americans that have been infected so far. NYC has opened three mass vaccination centers in Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens with each able to dish out about 1,400 doses a day. City health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan is pictured at the mass vaccination center in Brooklyn Each center can give out between 75 and 85 doses at once, a spokesman for the New York Department of Health said Pictured above are the vaccination tablesin the vaccination center, set up in an old spots hall Appointments ran out within an hour of going live on Friday, several publications reported. There are growing calls for New York to secure more doses This Friday the city's Department of Health announced it was opening up appointments for another 17,000 doses of the vaccine. The appointments opened at 6 p.m., but an hour-and-a-half later health officials tweeted they had all been booked. Several papers reported they were full in an hour. Ondrea Didier, a resident in Chelsea, was one individual who 'got lucky' after securing a dose at the mass vaccination center in Flatbush. Previous 1 Next             They told  CBS New York : 'There would be one appointment in the Bronx or something, and then that would be gone. There'd be one in Staten Island, that would be gone.  'I don't know how I got this appointment. I just got lucky.' Vincent Vega, a Harlem resident who also secured a dose at the center, said: 'I didn't care where it was going to be. 'I know that, obviously this is a serious thing and a lot of people didn't take Covid very seriously, especially people around me. 'They're like, ""oh, it's not gonna be that bad"", and two years later we're wishing we were more cautious.' The mass vaccination sites are able to deliver between 75 and 85 doses at once, a spokesman for the health department told DailyMail.com. They are an echo of the Covid vaccination drive, when mass centers were doling out thousands of doses a day in an attempt to protect everyone against the virus. Announcing the opening of the centers on Friday, NYC's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said: 'The Health Department is moving quickly to distribute as many vaccine doses as we can in the most equitable way possible. 'With cases rising, it's clear that there is a great need for more vaccine in New York City, and we are working with our federal partners to obtain more doses.' Pictured above are men lining up to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine in Brooklyn yesterday Men wait in line to receive a dose of the monkeypox vaccine in Brooklyn New York received another 26,000 doses last week, with another 9,000 held back to offer to people who are close contacts of known cases. Its roll out has been repeatedly slammed for failing to offer enough doses, and problems with its vaccination booking system. Last month the Health Department told residents to not try to book doses until late in the afternoon when slots would become available. But a 'technical glitch' saw some residents given early access to the slots, meaning they were almost fully booked before they went online. Concerns have also been raised by the city's decision to delay second doses, in order to provide primary inoculations. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration have warned against the move, saying it has not yet been properly tested.  It comes amid mounting concern that the virus will spill over into other groups that are more vulnerable. On Friday it was revealed that two children had tested positive for monkeypox. Although health officials said both were 'doing well', medics say children under eight years old are generally more at risk from the virus.  Two children have tested positive for monkeypox in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed Friday. One is a toddler from California; the other is in an infant who is not a U.S. resident and was 'transiting through' Washington D.C. Neither had contact with each other. Health officials said both children were 'doing well', but warned children under the age of eight are at high risk of severe monkeypox. It is thought both children likely caught the virus from 'household contacts'. Dr Rochelle Walensky said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak. It was not clear when they caught the virus, or what symptoms they suffered. They are receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation. They are the first cases among children to be detected in America. There are currently more than 2,500 cases of monkeypox in the U.S. — the second biggest outbreak in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  A boy under 10 years old tested positive for the virus in the Netherlands in June, as was revealed this week. The Dutch child suffered more than 20 red lesions on his face, forearms and thighs but had no fever or swollen lymph nodes — with the infection mostly clearing within a week. Revealing the infections at a virtual event for the Washington Post, Walensky said: 'We have seen now two cases that have occurred in children. 'Both of these are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community, the gay men's community.' She added that these cases have been on the whole 'adjacent to the community most at risk'. In a press release, the agency said: 'CDC and public health authorities are still investigating how the children became infected. 'While both children have monkeypox symptoms, they are in good health.' They added: 'Monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which — in the case of children — could include hugging, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups and utensils.' Last week the CDC said it was only aware of monkeypox infections among adults, mostly in gay or bisexual men. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert warned last week the virus had likely already spread to other groups, but that this was yet to be detected due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that children — as well as older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. In the Dutch case, doctors said they counted 20 lesions on the face, ear, forearms, thighs and back of the child — but that he did not suffer a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, they added. It was not clear how he became infected, although doctors said he likely had contact with an infected person or contaminated object that 'was not recognized'. Monkeypox primarily spreads through close physical contact or towels or bedsheets that have also been used by a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transmitted through the air. The CDC has been repeatedly slammed for its response to the virus, with testing initially being slow to get off the ground masking the spread of the virus. There have also been problems rolling out the vaccine, with New York City — at the epicenter of the crisis — having to delay second doses for patients because too few jabs have been supplied.  ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11046817/NYC-opens-THREE-mass-vaccination-centers-monkeypox-able-dish-1-400-doses-day.html,The Daily Mail
"CDC chief insists monkeypox outbreak is NOT out of control after former FDA director said only a 'fraction' of cases have been found and number of cases QUADRUPLE to nearly 2,000 in two weeks",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-19 15:50:00,"The director of the  CDC  insisted warnings that the  monkeypox  is out of control were 'misinformed and off base' on Monday despite cases in the U.S. quadrupling over two weeks. Dr Rochelle Walensky also claimed in a statement that it was still possible to 'significantly decrease' infections thanks to more testing — with about 10,000 swabs carried out a day — more vaccines, and more awareness. Walensky's comments came after Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that the window to get a handle on the tropical disease had likely already closed. Firing a broadside at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he also accused the agency of repeating the same mistakes as when Covid first arrived. Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told DailyMail.com today it was not yet clear whether the disease was out of control — although this should emerge in the coming weeks thanks to ramped up testing. America currently has about 1,900 cases of monkeypox — up from 500 two weeks ago — but many experts fear there are already several thousand. Dr Rochelle Walensky, who heads up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), claimed it was 'misinformed' to say monkeypox was already out of control. But Dr Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, made the warning this weekend as case numbers continued to accelerate Insisting monkeypox could still be contained, Walensky said in a statement emailed to DailyMail.com: '(Gottlieb's) interview was misinformed and off base. 'It's true that we have work to do — here and internationally — and are likely to see more monkeypox cases in the near term. 'But it is possible to significantly decrease the number of cases and contain the current monkeypox outbreak through education and increased testing and access to vaccines — all priorities we've made dramatic progress on.' Walensky also said the CDC was now carrying out 80,000 swabs for monkeypox a week, up from 6,000 when the disease first emerged in early May. Previous 1 Next             She also claimed credit for the vaccine roll out, which has been repeatedly criticized for being too slow to get doses to people. America has faced three outbreaks of monkeypox in the past, with each being successfully contained. The largest was in 2003 when 47 people caught the virus from infected pet prairie dogs. But the current outbreak differs from the others in that the disease is spreading following close contact during sex, particularly among gay and bisexual men. Warning Sunday that monkeypox was likely out of control, Gottlieb told  CBS : 'I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. 'If it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close.' He added: 'We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases because we had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested. New York City is set to delay rolling out second doses of the monkeypox vaccine because it has too few doses, health officials say amid warnings the U.S. outbreak is already out of control. The city's Department of Health warned Friday it would likely be unable to meet this deadline because it has received too few doses from the federal government. Guidance states patients should receive their second dose of the jab four weeks after the first to ensure best protection.  New York — which is at the epicenter of the outbreak — has switched track to prioritize getting first doses to as many patients as possible. It is also releasing the 1,000 doses it initially held back for second shots. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears over a vaccine shortage telling STAT News that New York City was among those set to receive yet more deliveries. Dr Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said it was 'not recommended' to delay second doses. 'By and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. 'So we're looking there, we're finding cases there, but it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now. We're not picking them up because we are not looking there.' Gottlieb also compared the response to monkeypox to that against Covid, saying the U.S. was making 'a lot of the same mistakes'. He pointed to a lack of testing early on and too few vaccines being made available quickly as warning signs that lessons had not been learned. Initially, the CDC was carrying out barely 100 tests a day nationwide while it struggled to hammer out deals with commercial laboratories. This has now risen to more than 10,000, but many medics are still saying they are having trouble accessing the tests because patients do not meet the criteria to be eligible. Several cities — particularly New York — are also facing issues getting hold of the monkeypox vaccine. New York is currently offering the jab to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. It is releasing batches of up to 9,000 appointments at a time, but these are being booked out within minutes. Supplies are so low that the city has also shelved plans for second doses — due four weeks after a first jab — in favour of inoculating as many people as possible. Residents have blasted the roll out of so few vaccines as 'ridiculous' considering the city has a population of more than eight million. And local politicians have also slammed the health department for failing to take action quickly to curb the outbreak. Hanage says it is still unclear whether the monkeypox outbreak could be contained. 'There's more testing available now thanks to the likes of labcorp, and it remains to be seen exactly how large the iceberg of undetected transmission chains is now we are looking for them,' he told DailyMail.com. 'That will determine whether it can be contained.' He also agreed with Gottlieb that the CDC appeared to be repeating many of the same mistakes it made during the early days of Covid.  'I think (Gottlieb) is right to comment that there are points of comparison in the response. Slow testing roll out for instance,' he said. 'I know from colleagues that they've struggled to get tests for patients with lesions that would be considered ""suspicious"".' Monkeypox cases have spiraled in recent days after the CDC ramped up testing for the virus, allowing it to break through the backlog. But it can take several days to diagnose a case after symptoms appear, because the tests rely on swabbing pustules which only appear in the later stages of infection. This leaves a window during which someone could unwittingly spread the infection to others.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11028137/CDC-chief-insists-monkeypox-not-control-United-States.html,The Daily Mail
Second Monkeypox death in Spain: Another person dies from virus after man in Alicante became Europe's first fatality and WHO declared outbreak an emergency,Laurence Dollimore For Mailonline,2022-07-30 11:49:00,"Spain  has confirmed its second death from  Monkeypox  as the number of cases worldwide continues to climb - and just days after the WHO declared the outbreak a 'global health emergency'.  The country's Ministry of Health confirmed the fatality on Saturday as its number of infections grew to 4,298, making it the world leader in terms of caseload outside of the US. The regions of Madrid and Catalunya count the most cases, with 1,656 and 1,406 respectively. At least 120 Monkeypox carriers have required hospitalisation in Spain, reported El Mundo, representing 3.2 per cent of cases, as one expert warned more deaths can be expected. It comes after a 'middle aged' man from Alicante, in the Valencia region, became the first death in Europe on Friday.  He has not been identified but health authorities said he died from encephalitis associated with the disease, a serious condition which causes the brain to become swollen.  It followed the death a 41-year-old male in Brazil. He had serious immune system complications and was hospitalised at the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, at the time of his death Thursday. Eight deaths have now been reported as part of the outbreak, with five occurring in African nations where the virus is endemic Monkeypox has affected more than 16,000 people across 75 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Several countries have now begun launching vaccination drives aimed at men who have sex with men, who continue to be the most at risk group (Pictured: Long queue forms at Guy's Hospital in central London on Saturday) Eight deaths have now been reported as part of the outbreak, with five occurring in African nations where the virus is endemic.  Experts in Spain said the strain of the virus currently plaguing the country is from Nigeria and is less fatal than those seen in other parts of the continent. But Alfredo Corell, professor of Immunology at the University of Valladolid warned: 'We are facing the possibility of seeing more deaths.'  While the average age of patients in Spain is 37, the age of those who have been infected range from 10 months old to 88.  Several countries have now begun launching vaccination drives aimed at men who have sex with men, who continue to be the most at risk group.  Huge queues for a walk-in jab service were pictured at Guy's Hospital in central London on Saturday, with similar scenes witnessed last weekend.  It comes after sexual health services, particularly in the capital, have been forced to cut back or even suspend walk-ins and other services as they struggle to cope with being on the frontlines of the outbreak.  Previous 1 Next             People queue up to receive monkeypox vaccinations during a pop-up clinic at Guy's Hospital in central London on July 30, 2022 Last week the World Health Organisation declared Monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee. It was the first time the chief of the U.N. health agency has taken such an action. 'We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,' Tedros said. 'I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members of the committee,' he added. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. Director General Dr Tedros said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was 'high'. The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. Although Monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spread beyond the continent or to move widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of individual outbreaks in Europe, North America and elsewhere.  Traditionally, people with Monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus.  Anyone can spread Monkeypox, but the current outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated almost exclusively among men who have sexual intercourse with men. The virus spreads primarily via intimate skin-to-skin contact, usually with someone who has an active rash, as well as via contact with contaminated clothes or bedding. It is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the COVID-19 pandemic. 'COVID is spread by respiratory route and is highly infectious. This doesn't appear to be the case with the Monkeypox,' said Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11064419/Second-Monkeypox-death-announced-Spain.html,The Daily Mail
"Former FDA chief says its still possible to get monkeypox outbreak 'back in the box' but that testing needs to be extended beyond just gay and bisexual men: US reaches 7,510 confirmed infections over weekend",Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-08-08 16:37:00,"Despite the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaring  monkeypox  a public health emergency last week, one key expert is still hopeful that the virus can be contained before it develops into a full fledged outbreak. Dr Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and current board member at pharma-giant  Pfizer , told  CBS' Face the Nation  on Sunday that while difficult, it is possible to prevent monkeypox from becoming an endemic virus - a prospect officials likely failed with Covid. He says that the response to the virus has to be wider to control it, though. At the moment, testing has mainly been reserved to just gay and bisexual men - who make up a overwhelming majority of cases. Gottlieb believes that more cases would be found if testing was expanded beyond just that community. His comments come days after HHS declared a public health emergency over the virus on Thursday. The 7,510 recorded cases are the most of any country in the world so far. Per capita, the nation's one case per million residents on August 5 is around half of the 1.93 per million cases being recorded in  Spain . One of these cases is among a daycare worker in Illinois. The unnamed employee in Eastern Illinois tested positive recently, potentially exposing the vulnerable children at the facility to the virus. Officials are screening children and staff for the virus and offering the potentially exposed the Jynneos vaccine. Previous 1 Next             ‘There’s a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Gottlieb said.  'We’re continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.’ While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that they still make up a majority of cases. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that the CDC should expand monkeypox testing and launch wastewater surveillance for the virus In mid-July, New York City officials revealed that 95 percent of cases in the Big Apple - the nation's monkeypox hotspot - were is men with at least three-in-five also identifying as gay, bisexual or lesbian. America is facing a shortage of both testing and vaccines at the moment, though, meaning that they have been reserved for men who have sex with other men to this point. The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point. Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained.  'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate.  'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’  The U.S. has confirmed 7,510 cases of the virus since it was first found stateside in May. Another 408 cases were added to the ledger over the weekend. Not a single death has been tied to the virus in the U.S., though nearly a dozen have internationally as part of this current outbreak. New York has far and away recorded the most cases of any U.S. state. The Empire State has logged 1,862 as of Monday morning. No other state has logged more than 1,000. Wyoming remains the lone state not to have recorded a monkeypox infection, though this could be due to a lack of surveillance in the state.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11092149/Former-FDA-chief-says-possible-monkeypox-outbreak-box.html,The Daily Mail
WHO may declare monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency after asking experts to meet again as cases continue to soar,Lizzie May For Mailonline,2022-07-16 18:12:00,"The  World Health Organisation  says they will reconvene their  monkeypox  committee to decide on if it should be considered a 'global health emergency'.

'If so, it will propose temporary recommendations on how to better prevent and reduce the spread of the disease and manage the global public health response.' Late last month, Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at the UKHSA, said: 'The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.  'We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.

New York City becomes the first in the US to record more than 100 cases of monkeypox just over a week after Pride celebrations as national tally rises to 605,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-07 15:05:00,"New York City  became the first metropolis in America to record more than 100 cases of  monkeypox  late Wednesday, just over a week after its annual Pride celebrations. The city's Department of Health revealed it has now spotted 119 infections with the tropical disease, up by half on the same time seven days ago. Before the Pride weekend concerns were raised that the events — which drew crowds numbering more than 2 million — could spread monkeypox. In San Francisco officials have already linked several Pride-themed parties in nightclubs to outbreaks of the disease. America has recorded 605 cases of monkeypox to date, with most in New York, California and Florida. No deaths have been reported. Experts warned before the Pride weekend that people should avoid skin-to-skin contact where possible, which is how the virus transmits. But health officials mostly brushed them under the carpet, with little attempt made to put out posters or have boots on the ground warning people over the disease. Just 1,000 doses of a monkeypox vaccine were rolled out — in a city of 8.3million — before the event, which was branded as 'ridiculous'. Previous 1 2 Next                   Experts are warning that gaps in testing and vaccine coverage will leave the United States vulnerable to losing control of the monkeypox outbreak. Public health leaders from the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSD) and George Washington University (GW) say that the response is 'fractured' which is likely to have 'severe consequences'. Previously, they have warned that the virus has likely been spreading undetected in the U.S. for some time, and fear it could become endemic in the nation is not curbed soon. 'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told The Hill. 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' Health officials in the city are yet to reveal whether any Pride events have been linked to outbreaks of monkeypox. But in San Francisco — where Pride celebrations were attended by an estimated 1.7million people — cases have already been traced back to two events. People who went to Afterglow about nine days ago were warned over potential exposure to monkeypox Monday. The following day Electroluxx — a large party attended mostly by gay men — also revealed that at least one attendee had since tested positive for the tropical disease. There are mounting concerns among experts that monkeypox is now 'out of control' in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently carrying out little more than a hundred tests for the virus every 24 hours. It has now signed on a commercial lab that could do more than 1,000 a day, although it is unclear when it will reach this number. Experts say that the poor testing regime is leaving many cases undetected, raising the risk they could spread monkeypox to others. Vaccines are being rolled out to gay or bisexual men who have sex with multiple partners every fortnight in New York city and Washington D.C. to stem the outbreak. Yesterday New York began offering 6,000 more slots for being jabbed against the tropical disease. But within hours the slots filled up once again amid high demand, leaving many trying to get the vaccine empty-handed. The roll out also faced a 'technical glitch', with some able to book their jabs early while others were locked out of the system. It comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed it would re-convene to consider whether to declare the outbreak an international emergency. Top officials at the agency met last week, but decided not to hit the panic button. However, cases have now climbed to more than 6,000 globally across at least 40 countries, with concerns mounting the disease could spill over into more at risk groups including older people and those with underlying health conditions. Only one death has been reported so far in Nigeria, although there are fears this number could yet rise. Revealing the decision to re-convene, WHO director Tedros Ghebreyesus said they were aiming to meet again in the week of July 18. Declaring an international emergency would lead to the WHO urging a 'coordinated' response between all nations affected.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10991465/New-York-City-record-100-cases-monkeypox.html,The Daily Mail
"NYC's monkeypox vaccine booking system CRASHES amid rocketing demand as 15,000 try to get jabbed while infections surge to over 1,000",Associated Press,2022-07-14 06:29:00,"Soaring demand for the  monkeypox  vaccine has caused the appointment system to crash in  New York City . City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the jab and vowed to build a 'stable appointment infrastructure' as the supply increases. Infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak in the U.S. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue.  Vaccines against monkeypox are being offered to men who have sex with men who have multiple sexual partners in a week They are also available to any close contacts of suspected or confirmed monkeypox cases People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. In San Francisco, where there have only been 68 confirmed cases, residents queued up for blocks to get their jabs. San Francisco residents queued up for blocks to get their jabs. The city has only seen 68 confirmed cases Only 50 doses out of 2,308 remain and city officials worry that the outbreak could get worse if the federal government doesn't provide more. Pictured: San Francisco on Tuesday The Golden Gate City's health department received 2,308 doses from the federal government last week and only 50 remain at the Zukerberg San Francisco General hospital monkeypox clinic, according to their Twitter post. They have not set up an appointment website, taking residents on a first come, first serve basis.  Four men wait in line for the vaccine at Wilton Manors in Florida as the jab was rolled out in the Sunshine State They will be forced to turn people away if more doesn't arrive soon, city officials warned on Tuesday. So far, health officials have recorded 1,700 doses of the vaccine have been administered. 'It is extremely infuriating that our federal government has once again failed in their response, especially after a two-year public health crisis,' Ande Stone, a senior community manager with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. 'After COVID, this should have been easy,' said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday.  'I kept refreshing and refreshing. ... I was frustrated.' Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. New York City is the first metropolis to record more than 100 cases of the virus in America 'It's going to haunt me,' he said. 'Me being a gay man who lives in Harlem, there's a lot of anxiety. I had four mosquito bites, and I was thinking what if this isn't a mosquito bite?' The city contracted with the company Affiliated Physicians to run its online appointment service after its previous contractor MedRite also suffered site crashes, according to  WNYC/Gothamist .  Both federal and local health officials have been caught flatfooted by the growing monkeypox outbreak 'This is further proof that demand is very high,' the city health commissioner Ashwin Vasan said in a statement. 'We apologize for the frustration caused and are working to build stable appointment infrastructure as we roll out more appointments as vaccine supply increases in the coming weeks.'  To date, New York City has administered nearly 7,000 vaccinations, while thousands more have been waiting for their chance to get inoculated against the virus.  Health officials said they were expecting 14,500 doses this week. New York City comic Jay Jurden, pictured, said he was particularly concerned that the city couldn't even get the online appointment process to work As of Wednesday, 336 people in New York City have tested positive for orthopoxvirus, a category of disease that includes smallpox.  That's a fourth more than the day before, according to city data.  Officials said they were fairly certain that all of the new cases are likely monkeypox and that many more cases remain undiagnosed. Learning from its experience with the rollout of COVID vaccines, Washington, D.C., is allowing residents to preregister for vaccination appointments.  As many as 3,000 slots were to open sometime Thursday, officials said. As news of the outbreak spread, Jeff Waters asked his doctor to be vaccinated before the Baltimore man left for a trip to Europe, where cases have been rising. 'They said 'Sorry, we just don't have them here,'' Waters recalled. Weeks later, the first signs of a monkeypox hit him while at dinner with a friend. He developed terrible headaches, a 102-degree (38.9-degree Celsius) fever, and intense chills. 'I feel grateful. I had a mild case,' Waters said. New York City is giving priority for the vaccine to men who have had anonymous sex with other men or who have had multiple partners over the past two weeks. Symptoms include rashes or sores that resemble pimples or blisters. They can sometimes be painful but usually not fatal.  Most people don't require hospitalization and recover within two to four weeks. Infections spread by direct contact with rashes, scabs or body fluids, according the CDC. It can spread through kissing, sex and body contact. In some cases, prolonged face-to-face exposure, as well as unwashed laundry contaminated by the virus, could lead to infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that commercial laboratories have been developing ways to test for the virus.  Spotify Privacy Policy  The CDC said the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis beginning this week would be accepting samples from across the U.S. to boost the country's testing capability. 'This will not only increase testing capacity but also make it more convenient for providers and patients to access tests by using existing provider-to-laboratory networks,' CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement earlier this week.

WHO declares monkeypox to be a global health emergency - the highest alarm it can sound - because of its 'extraordinary' spread to more than 70 countries,Jonathan Rose For Mailonline,2022-07-23 09:59:00,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak to be a global health emergency - the highest alarm it can sound - following its 'extraordinary' spread to more than 70 countries. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee.  It was the first time the chief of the U.N. health agency has taken such an action. 'We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,' Tedros said. 'I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members of the committee,' he added. A global emergency is WHO's highest level of alert, but the designation does not necessarily mean a disease is particularly transmissible or lethal.  WHO's emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, said the director-general made the decision to put monkeypox in that category to ensure the global community takes the current outbreaks seriously.  The UN health agency's declaration could spur further investment in treating the once-rare disease - and also worsen the scramble for scarce vaccines. Monkeypox has affected over 15,800 people in 72 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on July 20 (stock image)  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (above) made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee Doctor Molly Dickinson administers a dose of the monkeypox vaccine to Arthur Macedo, 37, in London Although monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere. Declaring a global emergency means the monkeypox outbreak is an 'extraordinary event' that could spill over into more countries and requires a coordinated global response. The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. Previous 1 Next             The emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak. Monkeypox has affected over 15,800 people in 72 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published on July 20. A surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic.  Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The first British monkeypox patient to go public is an HR manager from London who caught the virus after being deported from Dubai for testing positive for HIV, MailOnline can reveal.  James M, 35, has spoken out after claiming that health chiefs still haven't contacted him despite being diagnosed with monkeypox nearly a fortnight ago. He slammed the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for 'a real lack of any basic process or care to stop the spread' of the tropical virus, which has so far infected more than 300 Britons, mostly gay and bisexual men. James — who wished to keep his surname anonymous — admitted he is not following self-isolation rules because 'I was told to stay home until UKHSA contacted me... and they never did.'  He accused the UK of having a lackadaisical approach to contact tracing, saying it was 'no wonder' Britain had more cases than any other country outside of Africa. There is also a lack of awareness about monkeypox's lesser-known symptoms, he claimed.  James was readjusting to life in west London when he began suffering from 'really weird aches' in his lower back, exhaustion, extreme thirst and pain when he used the toilet. He became convinced he had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) after sleeping with around 10 new partners in the weeks before his symptoms started.  'I'm a gay man, and having just come back to the UK, I was having a good time,' he told MailOnline.  But medics wrongly assumed it wasn't monkeypox because he didn't have the virus' tell-tale rash.  James M, 35, has become the first British monkeypox patient to go public On June 23, the WHO convened an emergency committee (EC) of experts to decide if monkeypox constitutes a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) - the UN health agency's highest alert level. But a majority advised the Tedros that the situation, at that point, had not met the threshold. The second meeting was called on Thursday with case numbers rising further, where Tedros said he was worried. 'I need your advice in assessing the immediate and mid-term public health implications,' Tedros told the meeting, which lasted more than six hours. WHO's top monkeypox expert, Dr. Rosamund Lewis, said this week that 99 per cent of all the monkeypox cases beyond Africa were in men and that of those, 98 per cent involved men who have sex with men.  Experts suspect the monkeypox outbreaks in Europe and North America were spread via sex at two raves in Belgium and Spain. 'Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern for the moment, this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,' Tedros said.  'That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.' Emergencies chief Ryan, explained what preceded the director-general's decision: '(Tedros) found that the committee did not reach a consensus, despite having a very open, very useful, very considered debate on the issues, and that since he's not going against the committee, what he's recognizing is that there are deep complexities in this issue,' Ryan said.  'There are uncertainties on all sides. And he's reflecting that uncertainty and his determination of the event to be a global emergency.' A US health expert sounded a grim warning late Friday. 'Since the last #monkeypox EC just weeks ago we've seen an exponential rise in cases,' Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said on Twitter. 'It's inevitable that cases will dramatically rise in the coming weeks & months. That's why @DrTedros must sound the global alarm.' 'A failure to act will have grave consequences for global health.' The European Union's drug watchdog on Friday recommended for approval the use of Imnavex, a smallpox vaccine, to treat monkeypox. Imvanex, developed by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, has been approved in the EU since 2013 for the prevention of smallpox. It was also considered a potential vaccine for monkeypox because of the similarity between the monkeypox virus and the smallpox virus. A viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Ninety-five percent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity, according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the New England Journal of Medicine - the largest research to date. Overall, 98 percent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and around a third were known to have visited sex-on-site venues such as sex parties or saunas within the previous month. The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days. Rashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11041513/WHO-set-declare-spread-monkeypox-global-health-emergency-highest-alarm-sound.html,The Daily Mail
EXCLUSIVE: Have monkeypox fears been overblown? Tropical virus may be up to 30 TIMES less deadly than originally stated as outbreak continues to sweep the world,John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline,2022-07-11 17:06:00,"Monkeypox  may be less deadly than originally feared, scientists claimed today.   The tropical virus was predicted to kill roughly one in every 100 people struck down as it swept through Europe earlier this year. But after roughly 9,000 cases around the world over the past few months, only three deaths have been recorded. It means monkeypox has a fatality rate of around 0.03 per cent, around 30 times less than first mooted when the outbreak kicked off.  Furthermore, all three of the deaths have occurred in African nations where the virus is considered endemic. No fatalities have been reported elsewhere, despite the current outbreak having now reached 70 countries. The virus, which causes a similar rash to its cousin smallpox, is spreading predominately in gay and bisexual men. Scientists claim better testing and healthcare in the countries experiencing the new outbreaks will be responsible. Virologists have also stated the virus itself could have mutated to be less severe.  The latest data shows there are currently 1,552 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, 201 more than the last report.  The majority of which have been in London but the virus has been spotted in all parts of the nation. The UK's outbreak has been eclipsed by Spain's which has now topped 2,000 cases A total of 9,109 monkeypox cases have been spotted around the world so far in 2022 with 70 countries reporting confirmed or suspected cases This WHO and Pan American Health Organization chart breaks down the nearly 8,00 cases reported as of  July 7 by region. It shows the vast majority of confirmed cases have been identified in Europe (salmon coloured bars) and the Americas (light blue bars) Previous 1 Next                         : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. : A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles. Monkeypox went from a little-known tropical disease to a household topic earlier this year when the global outbreak began to take off.  Britain, the first country to raise the alarm, has now recorded 1,500 cases. London is the hotspot, accounting for 62 per cent of all known infections. Only six patients are known to be women. In its latest update on the virus, published on Friday, the UKHSA said there had been 6,027 cases and three deaths (two in the Central African Republic and one in Nigeria) reported around the globe as of July 6.  But more up-to-date estimates claim the actual number of cases sits in the region of 9,000. The West African variant, behind the current spread, has an estimated fatality rate of 1 per cent, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) analysis of previous outbreaks. If this proportion had come to pass, the world would have seen up to 90 monkeypox fatalities by now. It can, however, take time for infected patients to become severely ill and feed into the death numbers. The 1 per cent figure relates to the virus' case-fatality rate, meaning it only takes into account diagnosed patients.  Better testing in Britain and other countries experiencing the outbreak is one reason why the mortality rate is lower than originally thought. Experts have also speculated that gay and bisexual men have more awareness of, and get checked more regularly for, sexually transmitted infections. Monkeypox's current case fatality-rate, based on the known 9,000 patients, roughly equates to 0.03 per cent — similar to that for flu and Covid. The infection-fatality rate, which considers everyone who catches the virus, is always lower.  Experts still do not know monkeypox's true infection-fatality rate but argue it will be even lower, given that thousands of cases are likely to have flown under the radar in the current outbreak.   Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'Quoted death rates for monkeypox are based on rates in endemic African countries.' As well as less testing, he added that they tend to have poorer access to high quality healthcare and high rates of poorly controlled HIV infection.  'Another point is in Democratic Republic of the Congo (one of the African countries where the virus is endemic), most deaths are in people who have malaria as well as monkeypox,' he added.  'Also in Africa, many cases are in children and some evidence that children are more likely to suffer severe disease.'   Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, also said the different health standards in countries like the UK and developing African nations could be behind the low number of deaths.     'These infections are generally in young fit people living in countries where a rapid response is available, so the case fatality rate is much less than predicted,' he said.  Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, also agreed that differing health systems could be behind the lower than the expected fatality rate.  He said: 'The estimates are predominantly in populations in Africa who will not have had access to testing, tracing and vaccination,' he said. 'It is also possible increased surveillance and contact tracing along with vaccination is providing protection from severe disease.'  However, he added that there could be other factors at play, including that a stealth strain of monkeypox could have been spreading that only sprung to light this year after it mutated. 'The virus itself carries at least 40 mutations compared to strains that were around in 2018,' he said.  'These changes may suggest the virus has been circulating at a low level for several years and could have evolved to become more infectious but less pathogenic.'  Monkeypox is not normally considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching contaminated clothing, bedding or towels, or by interacting with infected animals.  The prevalence of the outbreak in gay or bisexual men prompted the UKHSA to urge Pride attendees earlier this month to watch out for the tell-tale blister-like spots and rashes to stop passing the disease on to others. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious People with tell-tale symptoms, which can also include having a fever and swollen lymph nodes, are advised to contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service for help.  As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts of infected are being offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. Anyone infected with monkeypox is also advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11002053/Monkeypox-30-TIMES-deadly-originally-stated.html,The Daily Mail

"New York City orders another 6,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine after health officials were blasted last week for being short on supply: US orders another 2.5 million jabs as infection tally nears 400",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-01 14:38:00,"New York City  will roll out another 6,000 doses of the  monkeypox  vaccine 'soon,' health officials say as America orders millions more jabs and the national tally surges to 396. The nation's hotspot was blasted last week after offering barely a thousand doses just days before the Pride weekend, with supply being so small that walk-ins were suspended just 90 minutes after the clinic opened. But now Gov Kathy Hochul has announced thousands more doses are earmarked for the city, which will be offered to the most at risk gay and bisexual men who are close contacts of cases or have multiple sexual partners in a fortnight. New York City has recorded 78 cases of the tropical virus, the most out of any city in the United States and 20 percent of the national tally. It came as the U.S. today ordered another 2.5 million doses of the Jynneous jab against the tropical disease, bringing its total to 4.4 million. The extra doses are expected to start arriving from October this year, and will then be made available to states to broaden inoculation efforts. Another 45 infections were confirmed across America yesterday with the tropical disease now spotted in as many as 28 states. Michigan is the latest to report monkeypox in a patient who is now isolating at home. No deaths from the rash-causing virus have been reported in America, but one fatality has been registered in Nigeria amid the global outbreak topping 5,000 cases. The above map shows monkeypox cases detected in America since the outbreak began. The table breaks this down by numbers, and also shows the number added in the last 24 hours More than a hundred men lined up outside the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan last Friday to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. The clinic only admitted people who had got appointments, and turned away all others Last week New York City opened a vaccination clinic for monkeypox without warning and made 1,000 doses available. But it had to stop offering doses by walk-in within 90 minutes and over appointment within hours after all slots were filled. People waiting at the clinic for the shot blasted the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million. Others accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Previous 1 Next             The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. Chis LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, also weighed in criticizing the roll out as a last minute move ahead of the Pride weekend. New York City has got hold of the doses through the White House which has made another 56,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine available to states across America. It was not clear when the city would start offering people appointments for the jab again. It was also not clear how many doses have been secured by other states.  This two-dose jab is about 85 percent effective against infections, and sparks protection within minutes of receiving the first dose. America will make another 240,000 doses of the vaccine available in the coming weeks, with a further 750,000 set to come on stream by the end of this year. The U.S. today announced a further order of 2.5million Jynneous doses.  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said: 'This order of additional Jynneous vaccine will help us push out more vaccine quickly, knowing that we have more doses on the way in the coming months — and is only possible because of our longstanding investment in smallpox and monkeypox preparedness.'  There are also plans to offer around the million or so doses of the ACAM2000 jab, although this is not preferred because of its more severe side-effects. Both vaccines were designed to tackle smallpox, but health chiefs say they should work as well against monkeypox because the two viruses are closely related. New York City and Washington D.C. are the first two areas to begin rolling out the monkeypox vaccine to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners.  Revealing plans to roll out more monkeypox vaccines in New York City plus 2,000 in the wider state, Hochul said: 'In New York State, we have seen a disproportionate number of cases, especially for LGBTQ+ New Yorkers, which is why my team and I will continue to work around the clock to secure as many vaccines as possible for our residents.'  It comes after it was revealed that America's first monkeypox patient to come forward was a gay actor in Los Angeles who caught the infection after 'skin-to-skin' contact with another patient. Matt Ford, who lives between New York City and Los Angeles, spoke out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should 'take it seriously'. He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Matt Ford, from Los Angeles, is the first patient to come forward to talk about his monkeypox diagnosis. He is pictured above with three spots due to the virus on his face Ford showed spots on his stomach (left) and arm (right). There were about 25 in total, he said, that had erupted all over his body Revealing his diagnosis, Ford said he initially noticed spots appearing in his 'underwear zone' which then spread across the rest of his body including face, arms, hands and abdomen. The patient, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man' said he counted 25 spots on his body to date. After appearing he said they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several in the 'sensitive area' became so painful that they left him unable to sleep without painkillers. Ford also suffered flu-like symptoms in the early stages ranging from a fever, chills, night sweats and a cough.  He is now isolating at home with the symptoms having largely subsided, but will remain there until all the spots have scabbed over and the scabs have fallen off. The CDC was performing about 60 tests for monkeypox a day last week, leaving it unable to stay on top of the virus. But it has now sent more swabbing kits to private laboratories as it aims to ramp up testing to tens of thousands a day.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10973163/New-York-City-orders-6-000-doses-monkeypox-vaccine.html,The Daily Mail
Monkeypox outbreak in Australian is 'spreading rapidly' with a string of new cases are detected - as experts warn of the symptoms YOU need watch out for,Farid Farid For Australian Associated Press,2022-07-06 14:53:00,"Monkeypox  may be spreading in Australia after  NSW  found likely locally transmitted infections among the state's 11 confirmed cases. NSW Health says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. 'People need to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, which can include fever, headache, body aches and a rash or lesions on the genital area,' NSW Health executive director of health protection Jeremy McAnulty said on Wednesday. Nine of the infections were acquired overseas but two may be local cases. Pictured: Perth Airport  Monkeypox can cause lesions and rashes on the skin as pictured above  He said the cases had not exhibited severe symptoms, such as an extensive rash or lesions all over the body. But Dr McAnulty warned even minor symptoms such as pimples in the genital area or buttocks needed to be taken seriously. Previous 1 Next             'The virus is mainly spread through skin to skin contact ... It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity.' 'It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity, as condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox.'  NSW Health says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. The disease can be transmitted through air droplets, close contact and sharing contaminated linen or objects. Pictured: Sydney  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection associated with travel to Central and West Africa. However, thousands of cases of monkeypox have been reported in Europe and the United States. The disease can be transmitted through air droplets, close contact and sharing contaminated linen or objects. Many of the cases have been among men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. It is usually spread through direct contact with animals such as squirrels, which are known to harbour the virus. However, it can also be transmitted through very close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa until now and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. However it can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Monkeypox shuts down some aspects of your body's ability to fight infections. Because of the presence of other viruses and bacteria which your body can't fight off, in the worst cases patients can succumb to a lethal shock throughout the body and blood poisoning. Death is more likely to occur in younger patients. The skin lesions are painful and disfiguring, and can be the source of further infections. Because monkeypox is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. One vaccine, Imvanex, was shown to be around 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox infection. Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10987669/Monkeypox-outbreak-Australian-NSW-cases-rise-11-symptoms-revealed.html,The Daily Mail

Thousands of monkeypox vaccines will be made available in Australia next week - here's how to find out if you are eligible,Jesse Hyland For Daily Mail Australia,2022-08-04 02:34:00,"Vulnerable Australians could receive a vaccine for  monkeypox  as soon as next week as the government looks to combat growing case numbers. There have been 53 cases of monkeypox reported in Australia and 25,000 across the world.  Australia currently has a stockpile of the ACAM2000 monkeypox vaccine, which can be used before or after exposure to the virus. Unlike other vaccines, people taking it are required to take precautions and cover the injection site until the scab falls off. There are also rare but serious side effects associated with it.  The alternative vaccine, known as JYNNEOS, which is a third generation vaccine, has fewer potential side effects, while also being easier to administer.  Health Minister Mark Butler has confirmed that the government has now secured additional doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, which can be used before or after exposure to monkeypox. 'We've secured supplies of new third generation vaccines,' he said in a statement. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has listed five key groups that are eligible for the vaccine. These include:   The federal government is set to make an announcement on Thursday about a monkeypox vaccine rollout in Australia (stock image) Further details about the vaccine rollout are set to be announced later today, but they will likely be administered by the states and territories to those vulnerable to the virus. ATAGI has recommended vaccination be considered for select groups including men who have sex with men with a high number of sexual contacts, and sex workers.   Previous 1 Next                         Monkeypox is transmitted through close physical contact, with the majority of cases being men who have sex with men. Identifiable symptoms include unusual rashes or lesions appearing on the skin.  People who contract monkeypox are required to isolate until their sores fully clear, which can be up to 21 days.  In May, NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant sent out a  warning for gay men in particular to watch out for symptoms and seek immediate help if concerned. In May, NSW's chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant sent out a warning for gay men in particular to watch out for the symptoms and seek immediate help if worried 'We know it's transmitted by that close skin to skin contact - you can be infectious and that close droplet contact in a very sort of close prolonged way,' Dr Chant said. 'We're particularly urging men who are gay or bisexual, or men who have sex with men, to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact by phone a sexual health clinic or GP without delay if they have any concerns.' The rare tropical disease is transmitted through close physical contact. It has been predominant amongst men who have sex with men (stock image) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Heath Paynter, acting CEO of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, commended the Commonwealth for securing the vaccines.  'The swift procurement of these vaccines is a very positive step. While local transmission of Monkeypox has so far been limited, we can't rely on that to continue.   'The availability of MPX vaccine for people who need it is a critical forward defence against transmission. It will help people look after their own health as well as that of people they are intimate with.  'Gay and bisexual men are already taking Monkeypox very seriously, monitoring for symptoms and regularly seeking medical advice. This is a very welcome additional tool.'  Alexis Apostolellis, CEO of the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine said: 'Australia's clinical workforce has learned a lot over the past two months about how to detect, treat and prevent monkeypox, and vaccination is the critical next step.'  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa.

Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. How does it spread? Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection by nature, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Contagious lesions, through which infections are most likely to be passed on, can appear on any part of the body. The infection can also be passed on through contact with clothing or linens used by an infected person. Until now, monkeypox had only ever been detected in four countries outside of Africa - the UK, US, Israel and Singapore. And all of those cases had travel links to Nigeria and Ghana. Most of the British and Spanish cases are gay or bisexual men, which officials say is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'. The sexuality of patients in other countries has not been disclosed. Health chiefs in the UK have issued a direct plea to men who have sex with men, telling them to come forward if they develop a rash on their face or genitals. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet.

NYC plans to delay second doses of monkeypox vaccine because of jabs shortage as officials warn outbreak is 'probably' out of control,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-18 15:38:00,"New York City  is set to delay rolling out second doses of the  monkeypox  vaccine because it has too few doses, health officials say amid warnings the U.S. outbreak is already out of control. The city's Department of Health warned Friday it would likely be unable to meet this deadline because it has received too few doses from the federal government. Guidance states patients should receive their second dose of the jab four weeks after the first to ensure best protection. New York — which is at the epicenter of the outbreak — has switched track to prioritize getting first doses to as many patients as possible. It is also releasing the 1,000 doses it initially held back for second shots. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears over a vaccine shortage telling  STAT News  that New York City was among those set to receive yet more deliveries. Dr Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said it was 'not recommended' to delay second doses. Dr Rochelle Walensky, who heads up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears saying more doses were scheduled to be delivered to New York City imminently. Dr Peter Marks, from the Food and Drug Administration, said it was not recommended to extend the dosing period America is currently rolling out the Jynneous vaccine, which is given as a two-dose course with the second shot administered four weeks after the first. But several countries — including the UK and Canada — have already expanded this bracket as they prioritize getting first doses into arms. The tweaking of dosing schedules has echoes of the Covid pandemic, where many countries — but not the U.S. — widened the gap between doses in order to reach more people faster. Previous 1 Next             Monkeypox may already be out of control in the United States, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner has warned. Speaking in a CBS interview Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb warned that the window for getting on top of the disease 'probably has closed'. He said the national tally — at 1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the actual number because of poor testing coverage. And that monkeypox had likely already spread outside of gay and bisexual men, but that this was yet to be detected. Monkeypox has now been spotted in almost every U.S. state — except Mississippi in the south, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, and in Maine and Vermont. Of the tally, eight cases have been spotted so far in women nationally, and none in children and adolescents. No studies have been carried out on how effective the Jynneous vaccine is with a longer gap between doses. But manufacturers point to trial results showing it is as effective as ACAM2000 — the other monkeypox vaccine — from two weeks after the first dose to show a longer dosing interval may be possible. Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, raised no concerns over extending the time between doses when asked by DailyMail.com. 'There's nothing magical about the dosing interval and individuals can be caught up when supply is more abundant,' he said. 'The priority is getting some level of immunity in those at highest risk for exposure.'  New York City launched its monkeypox vaccine roll out on June 23 for gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. The first recipients will be eligible for their second jab in just three days time. Revealing the delay Friday, the city said: 'Given the rapid increase in cases, the Health Department has decided that providing first doses to offer protection to more at-risk New Yorkers is the best strategy until we receive adequate vaccine supply. 'In many instances, this means that individuals may not get a second dose by the 28-day interval between doses as indicated in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing label.' They added: 'Until there is sufficient supply in the city, all vaccine doses will be treated as first doses, and we will only begin scheduling second dose appointments once we have enough vaccine to do so. 'The Department will communicate to people who have received first doses about when second doses are available and how to receive them.' Monkeypox vaccines are in very high demand in New York City, with appointments for the 9,300 doses released Friday all booked within minutes. Washington D.C., the other rolling out the jabs, is also seeing appointments run out rapidly. Nationally, more than 1,800 cases have been detected across all but seven states — Alaska, Maine, Montana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In New York the 489 cases have all been detected among men, with 60 percent identifying as either gay or bisexual. But a top expert has warned that the tropical disease has likely already spilled over into other groups — but is yet to be detected. No fatalities from the disease have been recorded in the U.S. to date, but young men who make up the bulk of the patients are at very low risk. There are mounting concerns, however, over the risk of fatalities should the disease reach pregnant women and older adults — who are more at risk. 'The negligible fatality rate won't necessarily persist if the virus escapes its current network: mostly young, mostly healthy adult men,' Donall McNeil, a journalist who sounded the alarm on Covid, Zika and other virus outbreaks, wrote for  Common Sense . 'In Africa, children and pregnant women are the most likely to die from monkeypox,' he added. Dr Scott Gottlieb warned on Sunday that the virus had likely spread to other groups besides gay or bisexual men, but was yet to be detected Walensky told STAT in an interview that anyone getting the vaccines would need two doses to get the 'higher level of protection'. She said: 'We're not asking New York — or anybody — to hold back doses right now because... we're pretty confident that what's going to come in is going to be able to cover those second doses.' Marks also warned against delaying second doses of the vaccine. 'We do not recommend to go off the recommended schedule here,' he said during a press conference at the Department of Health and Human Services. 'A single dose of this vaccine will not provide the kind of protection over time that is necessary if people continue this risky behavior. 'So, the two-dose regimen is the best that we can do to make sure that we actually have people get the protection that the vaccine is intended to provide.' Monkeypox may already be out of control in the United States, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner has warned. Speaking in a CBS interview Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA, warned that the window for getting on top of the disease 'probably has closed'. He said the national tally — at 1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the actual number because of poor testing coverage. And that monkeypox had likely already spread outside of gay and bisexual men, but that this was yet to be detected. Monkeypox has now been spotted in almost every U.S. state — except Mississippi in the south, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, and in Maine and Vermont. Of the tally, eight cases have been spotted so far in women nationally, and none in children and adolescents. Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation', Gottlieb said: 'I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. If it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close.' On the current tally, he added: 'We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases because we had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested and by and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. 'So, we're looking there, we're finding cases there, but it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now.  'We're not picking them up because we are not looking there.' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11024549/NYC-plans-delay-second-doses-monkeypox-vaccine.html,The Daily Mail
"Monkeypox is mutating at 12 times the expected rate potentially making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus, experts warn",Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-27 22:03:00,"The  monkeypox  virus strain that has emerged across the world in recent weeks may be evolving at an abnormally fast rate - making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that the virus has replicated up to 12 times its expected pace since 2018. This means that the virus, which is generally believed to spread by physical touch, contaminated surfaces or very close bodily contact could be able to spread in ways atypical to the tropical viruses normal patterns. It would explain the recent global monkeypox update, where 201 cases have been detected across 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C., with over 3,500 cases detected worldwide in countries where the virus is not endemic. Researchers found that the current strain of the monkeypox virus that has caused worldwide outbreaks of the tropical virus is mutating at a speed 12 times what is expected of it. This potentially makes it more transmissible Researchers, whose findings are pending official publishing in nature, collected and studied 15 samples of the monkeypox virus for the study. The NIH team restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. While the virus was detected recently in human populations, experts believe this strain of West African monkeypox first began its movement through the world in 2018. How viruses mutate and circulate is a generally known science. DNA viruses like monkeypox generally do not rapidly mutate - like COVID-19 does. Previous 1 Next             The nature of the virus allows it to fix errors that emerge when it replicates, leaving much lower room for mutations to form - and in effect limiting the number of variants. When researchers did investigate this strain of the virus, they found that it had mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. Why exactly this is can not be determined, though the experts believe that this could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year. Cases of monkeypox have appeared in nearly 50 countries where it is not endemic in recent weeks.  While occasionally non-endemic nations will find cases - two were detected in the U.S. in 2021 - infections are usually easy to find and outbreaks can be controlled by health officials once they catch wind of circulation. This outbreak has been different, though, with cases quickly being detected in droves around the world. This could signal a more infectious version of the virus is afoot.  The 201 cases in the U.S. this year are believed to be a severe undercount as some experts have warned that the country does not have the necessary testing and tracking capabilities to stay on top of each new case. The version of monkeypox spreading around the world is of the West African variety, but it is mutating at a pace that would not be expected of a DNA virus (file photo) Some even fear that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., UK and other countries around the world. Most infections that have been spotted as part of the current outbreak are among gay and bisexual men, both in the U.S. and across Europe. California, America's most populous state, has recorded 51 infections thus far - the most of any state. New York and Illinois have also logged 35 and 26 respectively. With the way the virus has spread through sexual networks, some fear that Pride festivities across America last weekend could lead to a surge in cases. In preparation, New York City health officials began to rollout monkeypox vaccines to the city's population last week. Supply of the shots quickly ran thin, though, with walk-in appointments being cut off on Friday due to high demand. With the jab taking around four days to fully activate as well, there are questions over whether the shots came out too late to matter ahead of the city's Pride parade which hosted around two million people.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10958337/Experts-warn-monkeypox-mutating-12-times-expected-rate.html,The Daily Mail
NYC health chiefs blame Feds for monkeypox cases spiraling in the city saying lack of vaccine was 'root cause' of outbreak - after second doses were delayed amid supply shortage,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-21 22:36:00,"Monkeypox  cases exploded in  New York City  because the Federal Government failed to supply vaccines quickly, the city's head of public health has insisted. Speaking in an interview with  CNN , Dr Ashwin Vasan, commissioner of NYC Health, warned the city's tally of 500-odd cases — the highest in America — was likely just a fraction of the total. He claimed the 'root cause' of the rapid spread of the illness was a failure by federal officials to roll out jabs against the disease quickly. New York City (NYC) and Washington D.C. are offering the jabs to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks in an attempt to put a lid on the outbreak. But their roll outs have been repeatedly blasted for not offering enough doses, with available appointments being fully booked minutes after they are opened. NYC is now delaying second doses — due four weeks after the first dose — because the priority is to roll out first jabs. The city says this is safe, but other experts have raised concerns as this has not previously been tested. Dr Ashwin Vasan, who heads up New York City's Department of Health, said the city was struggling to get a handle on monkeypox because it was getting too few jabs from the central Government Speaking about the monkeypox vaccine roll out, Vasan said it was proving 'challenging' with several technical issues. 'But the really root issue here has been access to vaccine supply,' he said, 'and that's a national issue'. 'We need to start seeing much more vaccine, and the rest of these things will smooth out as people can get access to the preventive therapies they want. Previous 1 Next             The director of the  CDC  insisted warnings that the  monkeypox  is out of control were 'misinformed and off base' on Monday despite cases in the U.S. quadrupling over two weeks. Dr Rochelle Walensky also claimed in a statement that it was still possible to 'significantly decrease' infections thanks to more testing — with about 10,000 swabs carried out a day — more vaccines, and more awareness. Walensky's comments came after Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that the window to get a handle on the tropical disease had likely already closed. Firing a broadside at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he also accused the agency of repeating the same mistakes as when Covid first arrived.   'We really need much more vaccine. I know that our partners are working hard in Washington and elsewhere, but we need that as soon as possible.' NYC has received more than 40,000 doses of the Jynneous jab to date, which are all being administered as first doses. But demand remains high, with appointments being booked out within minutes after they are released. Nationwide, almost 200,000 jabs have been distributed to states so far. America has also placed orders for millions more doses — in a sign officials expect to use many more jabs.   Asked whether the current cases tally for NYC was accurate, Vasan said: 'I think we can definitively say it's not. 'And that's because only now are we seeing clinical testing starting to ramp up. 'I think we're going to see cases rise all across this country over the coming weeks as clinical testing increases.' On preventing the disease spreading, he added: 'I will say that abstinence as a message doesn't really work. We know this. 'It's not a good public health tool because it's really about giving people the information to make safe choices but understanding we need to meet them where they are with those choices and give them the information to tell them how monkeypox is transmitted.' New York City's vaccine roll-out was slammed when it began last month for being announced via Twitter, meaning the message got to those on the social media platform first. It offered walk-ins for the first 24 hours, before scrapping this amid high demand for the shots. The roll-out was also criticized after a technical glitch saw thousands book their vaccination appointment early. The Department of Health had said it would only release the vaccination slots after midday, but the appointments went live early on a separate link that had been used to book appointments during the first round of inoculations. Earlier this month the city also announced it was delaying second doses because it was not receiving enough jabs from the Federal Government. NYC also undertook contact tracing, although it appears to have failed to curb the rash-causing virus with many cases turning up not linked to other infections. America is rolling out the Jynneous vaccine to fight the virus, which is given as two doses about four weeks apart. It also has more than a million doses of the ACAM2000 vaccine available, but this is not being used because it is associated with serious side-effects.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11036647/NYC-health-chiefs-blame-Feds-monkeypox-cases-spiraling-city-blaming-lack-vaccine.html,The Daily Mail
Experts fear an early wave of flu could combine this year with monkeypox and covid increases,Kaya Terry For Mailonline,2022-07-01 01:47:00,"Britain should brace for an early flu outbreak that will coincide with increasing Covid and  monkeypox  cases, a top expert has warned.  Health officials have said they are expecting an 'early influenza wave' in the UK because there has not been a 'proper' flu season since the start of the Covid pandemic.  Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said she is watching Australia - currently in its winter season - 'very carefully' after a strain of influenza 'started early and spread fast across all age groups'.  She said the country is 'having its worst flu season in five years', which could replicate in the UK as early as September. Meanwhile, Dr Hopkins added that we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox'.  There are also mounting fears that the NHS will be struck down at the same time by Covid, with colder weather and darker evenings leading to increased social contact indoors — where viruses find it easier to spread. Flu is a seasonal menace on the NHS, with outbreaks more likely between September and March because colder weather forces more people indoors where the virus — like Covid — finds it easier to spread. But influenza virtually disappeared last winter amid lockdowns aiming to control the spread of Covid. Britain should brace for an early flu outbreak that will coincide with increasing Covid and monkeypox cases, a top expert has warned (file image) Health officials have said they are expecting an 'early influenza wave' in the UK because there has not been a 'proper' flu season since the start of the Covid pandemic Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox' Experts are now concerned over the lack of population immunity following the pandemic and the prospect of a bad winter, which could cripple the NHS, reports  The Telegraph . Speaking on Thursday in a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr Hopkins said: 'We are planning for an influenza wave. I don't know if people re following Australia, but we are watching very, very carefully.  'It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave. 'While we normally don't see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October – that's what we're planning for.' Previous 1 2 Next                   Meanwhile, Dr Hopkins added that we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox'.  She added: 'We will see at least one Covid wave in the autumn-winter, once we have got through the current wave. And, for the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox.'  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests 1.3million people in England were infected during the week to June 18, up by a fifth compared to the previous estimate. Yet the week-on-week rise is half of the 40 per cent spike logged in last week's projection. Cases are also on the rise in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Experts previously told MailOnline the figures suggest the current wave 'may be slowing' already and 'may not go that high after all'. They admitted, however, that the peak is still to come. Dr Hopkins said: 'For the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox' The Omicron sub-strains BA.4 and BA.5 are now the dominant strains in the UK, the UK Health Security Agency today confirmed for the first time. They are thought to be even more infectious than their ancestral versions, which were to blame for cases reaching pandemic highs in December and April, but just as mild. Meanwhile, Monkeypox cases in the UK have risen above 1,000 as the rare disease continues to spread, officials confirmed today. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said there had been 1,076 infections as of Sunday, almost double the number a fortnight ago. Authorities said they expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and are advising anyone going to large events or having sex with new partners to 'be alert' for symptoms.   Dr Hopkins revealed there are now 20 to 40 new cases every day and said: 'This year will be even more challenging than normal.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10971591/Experts-fear-early-wave-flu-combine-year-monkeypox-covid-increases.html,The Daily Mail
"Monkeypox is declared an 'imminent threat to public health' in New York because of ongoing and rapid spread - as survey reveals 20% of Americans fear infection: US case tally nears 5,000",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-29 16:39:00,"Monkeypox  has been declared an 'imminent threat to public health' in New York because of the ongoing and rapid spread of the disease, health officials announced on Thursday. The state leads the nation in confirmed cases, having recorded 1,247 of the 4,907 infections in America — with nearly all cases in and around  New York City . State health commissioner Dr Mary Bassett said the declaration would 'free up' extra funding to help prevent the disease's spread. It came the same day San Francisco officials said they would declare a 'local emergency' over monkeypox as its infection tally reached 241. No nationwide alert has been issued yet, although the Biden administration is considering the move. The above map shows the number of monkeypox cases declared across the U.S. by CDC The above graph shows the total number of cases of monkeypox confirmed in the United States. This week the tally shot up by more than 1,000 in 24 hours, which officials said was down to 'historic' cases finally being recorded Previous 1 Next             Every American should 'pay attention' to the monkeypox outbreak because the disease could spill over into more groups than just gay men, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned Thursday — before U.S. cases topped 4,900, the highest tally in the world. Dr Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, issued the stark warning during a press briefing, adding that infections with the disease were 'painful' and could also be dangerous. He did insist it was 'absolutely' still possible for the U.S. to eliminate monkeypox. The vast majority of cases are still among gay or bisexual men, but last week America recorded its first two cases in children — in a toddler in California and infant traveling through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman who tested positive when she was near full-term. Top experts have been warning for weeks that other groups could catch the disease because it does not require sexual contact to transmit, but only close contact such as hugs or brushing the rashes of an infected person. Making the declaration Thursday, Bassett said: 'Based on the ongoing spread of this virus, which has increased rapidly and affected primarily [gay or bisexual male] communities... I've declared monkeypox an Imminent Threat to Public Health throughout New York State. 'This declaration means that local health departments... will be able to access additional State reimbursement, after other Federal State funding sources are maximized. '[This will held] protect all New Yorkers and ultimately limit the spread of monkeypox in our communities.' Concern has been growing over monkeypox after cases spiked by more than 1,000 in a day on Wednesday — with officials predicting they will keep rising for 'weeks'. About 99 percent of infections have been detected in men, with the 'vast majority' among those who are gay or bisexual. But top experts fear the disease will spill into more vulnerable groups. Over the last seven days America has recorded its first two cases in children — a toddler in California and infant in Washington D.C. — and one in a pregnant woman. In announcing plans to declare monkeypox an emergency this week, San Francisco's mayor London Breed said the 'early action' was needed to 'protect public health'. 'Many people in our LGBTQ+ community are scared and frustrated,' she said. 'This local emergency will allow us to continue to support our most at-risk, while also better preparing for what's to come.' Director of Health for the Bay Area city Dr Grant Colfax said the COVID-19 pandemic had taught them that early action was needed to contain the disease. Their declaration will go into effect on August 1. The Biden administration is also expected to declare monkeypox a health emergency in the coming days,  Politico  reports.  It would follow on from a similar decision made last week by the World Health Organization, after they previously shied away from the move. When this was declared, the White House said it was a 'call to action' for countries to begin 'stopping' the spread of the virus globally. Both cities have struggled to get hold of enough doses of the vaccine to protect citizens against the disease. New York City is offering the jab to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners in a fortnight, while San Francisco is rolling it out to 'everyone who wants it'. New York got another 110,000 doses yesterday with 80,000 earmarked for New York City, on top of the 60,000 rolled out statewide so far. But San Francisco was offered only 4,220 out of the 35,000 it had initially requested. Roll outs have previously been slammed for their slow pace, and how it's 'ridiculous' so few jabs are available in such large cities. America has the most confirmed monkeypox cases in the world. But when the data is considered per head - a more accurate measure because it takes into account countries differing population sizes - it shows Spain has the worst outbreak It comes after a survey warned concerns over monkeypox were growing among Americans amid spiraling cases. The Annenberg Public Policy Center, a part of the University of Pennsylvania, interviewed 1,500 Americans over whether they were concerned about catching Covid or monkeypox two weeks ago. It found 19 percent said they were worried about being infected with monkeypox. A greater proportion — 30 percent — said they still had concerns over catching Covid. The majority of people surveyed said they were not concerned about becoming infected with either disease. The center's director Kathleen Jamieson said: 'It's important that the public calibrate its concerns to the reality of the risk of Covid and monkeypox and act appropriately.' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11061971/Monkeypox-declared-imminent-threat-public-health-New-York.html,The Daily Mail
Today host's Covid question sparks an angry response from expert as the WHO declares a public health emergency for monkeypox: 'Actually that's wrong',Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia,2022-07-24 23:51:00,"A host on The Today Show was put in his place by an expert from the  World Health Organisation  after he questioned if they were 'too slow' in their response to Covid. The WHO has now declared the  monkeypox  outbreak, which has been seen in more than 70 countries, a global public health emergency. There are more than 16,000 cases worldwide and including upwards of 40 in Australia. WHO epidemiologist Dr Margaret Harris appeared on the breakfast show on Monday morning and was asked whether the declaration was an 'overreaction'. WHO epidemiologist Dr Margaret Harris appeared on The Today Show on Monday morning to discuss the recent declaration of monkeypox as a global public health emergency 'Doctor, I guess there's some concern because with the benefit of hindsight, now we remember those months in early 2020 when Covid was building around the world and the World Health Organisation didn't declare it an emergency,' co-host Charles Croucher said. 'Is this a reaction to, perhaps, being too slow on that front?' Dr Harris replied: 'Actually that's wrong. 'We also declared a public health emergency of international concern for Covid on January 30, 2020, but we did that early again because we didn't want it to become a pandemic. There are more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox worldwide and over 40 in Australia 'That's, again, why we declare these things early, to try to get the world together.' Dr Harris said the reason for declaring monkeypox a global emergency so early on was to raise awareness, and 'bring the international scientific community together' to work on combating the virus. Previous 1 Next             She added the WHO was concerned the virus would have disastrous impacts on those who were immunosuppressed. 'We want the world to take it seriously and take the actions we've recommended and we want those actions taken now,' she said. Dr Harris said the reason for declaring monkeypox (pictured) a global emergency so early on was to raise awareness, and 'bring the international scientific community together' to work on combating the virus Co-host Ally Langdon then asked if the the emergency declaration may be sparking fear in the community unnecessarily. Dr Harris said that was a factor taken into consideration when the decision was made.  'There is also concern that people would then stigmatise the populations in which the virus is transmitting very rapidly,' she said. 'And it is a hard one because you don't want people to say, ""Oh, you're overreacting"", or you don't want people to panic unnecessarily.' Monkeypox - often caught through handling monkeys - is a rare viral disease that kills around 10 per cent of people it strikes, according to figures. The virus responsible for the disease is found mainly in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958, with the first reported human case in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970. Human cases were recorded for the first time in the US in 2003 and the UK in September 2018. It resides in wild animals but humans can catch it through direct contact with animals, such as handling monkeys, or eating inadequately cooked meat.  The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, or the eyes, nose or mouth. It can pass between humans via droplets in the air, and by touching the skin of an infected individual, or touching objects contaminated by them.  Symptoms usually appear within five and 21 days of infection. These include a fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and fatigue. The most obvious symptom is a rash, which usually appears on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. This then forms skin lesions that scab and fall off. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can often prove fatal. There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox infection, according to the World Health Organization.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11044461/WHO-expert-SLAPS-Today-host-Covid-question-monkeypox-emergency-declaration.html,The Daily Mail
"New York becomes first US state to declare monkeypox outbreak a DISASTER EMERGENCY: Gov. Kathy Hochul says she’s ‘sounding the alarm’ as Empire State hits 1,400 cases",Joseph Michalitsianos For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-31 01:33:00,"New York governor Kathy Hochul announced late Friday that  monkeypox  is now a state disaster emergency as her administration struggles to disperse vaccines to contain the spread. The announcement comes as monkeypox cases rise in  New York City , the current US epicenter of the outbreak, where case counts passed 1,400 on Friday.  Hochul tweeted: 'I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our ongoing efforts to confront the monkeypox outbreak.  'This Executive Order enables us to respond more swiftly, and allows health care professionals to take additional steps that will help get more New Yorkers vaccinated.' Hochul continued: 'More than one in four monkeypox cases in this country are in New York, currently having a disproportionate impact on at-risk groups.  'We are working around the clock to secure more vaccines, expand testing capacity, and educate New Yorkers on how to stay safe.' Monkeypox is currently hitting gay men the hardest, with an estimated 95 per cent of US infections occurring among them. New York City is home to one of the United States largest LGBT communities, and is in line to receive 110,000 doses of the federal governments 800,000 upcoming monkeypox vaccines - but Hochul still wants more.  New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared the monkeypox disease an emergency in her state, making New York the first state to do so New York City Mayor Eric Adams also declared a public health emergency, as he moves to 'expand outreach and access to vaccines and treatment to keep people safe.'  'New York City is currently the epicenter of the outbreak, and we estimate that approximately 150,000 New Yorkers may currently be at risk for monkeypox exposure,' he continued in the statement.   Hochul echoed the fear and told reporters Saturday 'what we’re seeing are signs where it could escalate dramatically.' 'When I’m making the case to the federal government that we need more doses, more than we’ve been previously allocated, I can demonstrate there is high demand and need,' Hochul continued  The announcements are mostly made to trigger emergency administrative functions, such as increasing the pool of people eligible to administer vaccines.  It also allows physicians and nurses practitioners to give out the shout, and also makes sure vaccine providers send data to the state government.  Previous 1 Next             New York is anticipating 110,000 vaccines from the federal government, of which 80,000 will go to New York City. Hochul emphasized there is an acute danger 'particularly in the gay male population,' but said 'we’re going to protect them. We’re not going to sweep this under the rug.'  No deaths have been registered in the country to date but several patients have been hospitalized.    The United States has become the global epicenter of the  monkeypox  outbreak, overtaking  Spain  following a record-breaking 24 hours in which 1,048 new cases were confirmed.

Previous 1 Next             Spain has the most per capita cases of monkeypox, while the U.S. has the greatest total number The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on Wednesday that the uptick in cases was likely due to an increase in testing, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week. By population — which takes into account the U.S. having seven-times more people than Spain — America has about one case per 100,000 people.    In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected.

"Monkeypox could become a 'permanently entrenched' STI in the US because early symptoms are 'easy to miss', Cornell expert warns - as cases jump to 244",Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-28 15:08:00,"Monkeypox  may become a 'permanently entrenched' sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the US because its early symptoms are easy to miss, an expert has warned. Dr Jay Varma, an epidemiologist at the Weill Cornell Medical School in  New York City , said early infection signs are 'innocuous' and in hard to see places — like the inside of the anus — raising the likelihood it is missed. This gives the rash-causing virus a window in which to transmit to others, before more serious signs like flu-like symptoms and rashes across the body appear.  Varma added that the tropical disease was also being aided by a lack of STI testing in the US, leaving many cases un-diagnosed. America has recorded 244 monkeypox cases to date, with another 43 spotted this weekend across 25 states and Washington D.C. But experts fear this could be just the 'tip of the iceberg', with many more infections in the community going undetected. This weekend the World Health Organization said it would not declare an international emergency over the emergence of the tropical disease. The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days Previous 1 Next             Writing in the  New York Times , Varma said: 'Other experts and I fear that monkeypox will exploit this vulnerability [of a lack of testing] and become a permanently entrenched STI in the United States. Dr Jay Varma, an epidemiologist from Weill Cornell Medical School in New York City 'Initial skin changes in this outbreak often appear innocuous and can occur in locations that are easy to miss, such as inside the anus.  'Nevertheless, these lesions are highly contagious and can even contaminate surfaces or materials such as towels, which can spread infection to other people.  'The skin changes can also mimic those of other infections, such as herpes, molluscum or syphilis, so monkeypox can be easily misdiagnosed by someone not expert in evaluating STIs.' The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. The rash-causing virus was mostly being passed on through skin-to-skin contact during sex, many officials believe. He added: 'While there is some debate among epidemiologists about whether to call monkeypox 'sexually transmitted' versus 'sexually transmissible,' it is reasonable to consider that sex is one activity that transmits infection, similar to other infections that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact during sex, like herpes, syphilis and the human papillomavirus.' Varma compares the situation to that of HIV — which entered America in the 1970s and 80s — and syphilis — which is thought to have arrived with the first settlers in the 1500s. Cases of common STIs — including chlamydia and gonorrhea — are already thought to be at an all-time high nationwide. Experts say this is in part because of interruptions to testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to too few people are getting swabbed. It is likely that many cases of monkeypox are also going undiagnosed due to a lack of testing, or being written off as another infection. Last weekend America recorded its biggest two-day rise in monkeypox infections since the outbreak was detected last month. The rash-causing virus is likely spreading under the radar as well.  Several cases now not linked to a previously known infection or international travel, and experts have warned that poor surveillance methods are leaving populations vulnerable.  Nationwide, California has the biggest outbreak, with 67 cases, followed by New York with 37 and Florida and Illinois with 27 each. Globally cases now top more than 4,000 across about 60 countries, but only one death has been recorded to date in an individual from Nigeria. Cases are mostly being detected among men who have sex with men at present. But there are fears it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk from the disease, such as the immunocompromised. The disease is primarily passed on through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions.   Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic It comes after the WHO did not declare a global health emergency over the monkeypox outbreak this weekend. In a statement Saturday, its emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. The  monkeypox  virus strain that has emerged across the world in recent weeks may be evolving at an abnormally fast rate - making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that the virus has replicated up to 12 times its expected pace since 2018. This means that the virus, which is generally believed to spread by physical touch, contaminated surfaces or very close bodily contact could be able to spread in ways atypical to the tropical viruses normal patterns. It would explain the recent global monkeypox update, where 201 cases have been detected across 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C., with over 3,500 cases detected worldwide in countries where the virus is not endemic. The version of monkeypox spreading around the world is of the West African variety, but it is mutating at a pace that would not be expected of a DNA virus (file photo) Researchers, whose findings are pending official publishing in nature, collected and studied 15 samples of the monkeypox virus for the study. The NIH team restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. While the virus was detected recently in human populations, experts believe this strain of West African monkeypox first began its movement through the world in 2018. How viruses mutate and circulate is a generally known science. DNA viruses like monkeypox generally do not rapidly mutate - like COVID-19 does. Previous 1 Next             The nature of the virus allows it to fix errors that emerge when it replicates, leaving much lower room for mutations to form - and in effect limiting the number of variants. When researchers did investigate this strain of the virus, they found that it had mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. Why exactly this is can not be determined, though the experts believe that this could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year. Cases of monkeypox have appeared in nearly 50 countries where it is not endemic in recent weeks.  While occasionally non-endemic nations will find cases - two were detected in the U.S. in 2021 - infections are usually easy to find and outbreaks can be controlled by health officials once they catch wind of circulation. This outbreak has been different, though, with cases quickly being detected in droves around the world. This could signal a more infectious version of the virus is afoot.  The 201 cases in the U.S. this year are believed to be a severe undercount as some experts have warned that the country does not have the necessary testing and tracking capabilities to stay on top of each new case. Some even fear that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., UK and other countries around the world. Most infections that have been spotted as part of the current outbreak are among gay and bisexual men, both in the U.S. and across Europe. California, America's most populous state, has recorded 51 infections thus far - the most of any state. New York and Illinois have also logged 35 and 26 respectively. With the way the virus has spread through sexual networks, some fear that Pride festivities across America last weekend could lead to a surge in cases. In preparation, New York City health officials began to rollout monkeypox vaccines to the city's population last week. Supply of the shots quickly ran thin, though, with walk-in appointments being cut off on Friday due to high demand. With the jab taking around four days to fully activate as well, there are questions over whether the shots came out too late to matter ahead of the city's Pride parade which hosted around two million people.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10961047/Monkeypox-permanently-entrenched-STI-Cornell-expert-warns.html,The Daily Mail
US monkeypox cases rise by record 63 in a DAY - bringing total infections to 306 - after Joe Biden revealed plan to roll out tens of thousands of vaccines,Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com,2022-06-29 15:48:00,"America's  monkeypox  cases have surged by a record 63 in just one day after the Biden administration unveiled plans to roll out tens of thousands of vaccines against the tropical disease. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) revealed the sharp rise on Tuesday — up 260 percent on 28 from the previous week — which took the nation's cumulative tally to 306 infections. New York — the national hotspot — saw the sharpest rise in patients with the rash-causing virus up 26 in a day, followed by  Illinois  where they rose by 18. The surge is unlikely to have been caused by the weekend's Pride celebrations because it takes more than a week for infected people to show symptoms and then get a test. Previous Pride month events may have played a role, though. The jump could be a result of increased surveillance, though. Last week the CDC ramped up monkeypox testing by sending thousands of kits to commercial laboratories around the U.S. It comes after the Biden administration revealed it has made 56,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine — which can work against monkeypox — available to states. It will be releasing another 240,000 jabs in the coming weeks. The vaccines are ear-marked for monkeypox patients, their close contacts, and gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over a fortnight or visited a venue such as a club where a case of the tropical disease was later detected. But critics say there are not enough doses, and have slammed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for taking 'too long' to inspect a factory in Denmark where the U.S. has a million vaccines waiting in limbo. The jabs can only come to the country once the factory is approved by the FDA. The map above shows where monkeypox cases have been spotted in the US, and the numbers being recorded in each state over the previous 24 hours Lines form at a New York monkeypox vaccine clinic last week, which quickly ran out of the 1,000 Jynneos doses that were offered to men at high risk Yesterday's record case rise over takes the previous record set on Monday when 43 infections were reported. But this figure included cases detected late Friday, Saturday and on Sunday. The growing infection tally suggests that the rash-causing virus is increasingly spreading undetected in the United States. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. New York City and Washington D.C. are the only two areas to start vaccinating the most at risk groups against monkeypox to date. But both ran out of slots for the vaccines within hours of opening their clinics amid surging demand. In New York officials had just 1,000 doses. Minnesota and Nebraska both recorded their first cases of monkeypox today.  The Biden administration's plans to roll out more Jynneous jabs were revealed just hours after advocates sent a  letter  to the  White House  slamming the administration's monkeypox response, saying that one million doses of the Jynneos vaccine already owned by the US are stuck in limbo in Denmark awaiting a facility inspection.  Although the vaccine itself has been approved for use by US regulators, the doses in Denmark were produced on a manufacturing line that is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval, officials said earlier this month.   The letter from PrEP4ALL and Partners for Health said in part: 'We must not allow the same failures of vaccine production and distribution that hampered the global COVID-19 response cause us to fail to contain the current monkeypox outbreak.' 'If this is a test run for pandemic preparedness, we are flunking,' PrEP4ALL co-founder James Krellenstein told the  Washington Post . 'We have more than a million doses of a vaccine FDA approved for preventing monkeypox,' he said. 'And the U.S. government cannot figure out how to get it out of freezers in Denmark — doses that it owns — when there's uncontained spread in the gay community.'  The Biden administration's new plan will immediately allocate 56,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories, with 1.6 million doses made available by the end of the year, officials said.  State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions' older ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but which has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised.  The United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000 in its stockpiles, officials said earlier this month, but the vaccine is not recommended for those with HIV.  The United States has officially recorded 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions -- but health officials fear that the true count could be higher.  Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread.  Workers sit outside of D.C. Health's first monkeypox vaccination clinic, which is administering the first Jynneos vaccine doses distributed in the U.S. capital on Tuesday Even after Tuesday's announcement, some advocates expressed concerns that vaccines would not get to those who need them the most, including men who have sex with other men, a group at higher risk. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told the Post   that the latest announcement was a 'confusing mess' that did not explain the formula for distributing vaccines. 'There are profound questions of how they will allocate limited vaccines to which jurisdictions, and states and local communities need a coordinated federal plan,' Harvey told the outlet.  'We need to reach people who are at risk for monkeypox and conduct widespread vaccine efforts for gay people and other men who have sex with men.' The White House said in a statement that the vaccine doses will be distributed to 'areas with the highest transmission and need, using a tiered allocation system.' 'As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk for monkeypox have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials have been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox.  Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic  The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Dr Jennifer McQuiston, Deputy Director of CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with the virus, those who know their sexual partner was infected, and gay men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where it is spreading. 'It's almost like we're expanding the definition of who a contact might be,' said McQuiston. If people have been to a party or other place where monkeypox has been known to spread 'we recommend they come in for a vaccine,' she said.  The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.  There have been no U.S. deaths and officials say the risk to the American public is low. But they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem. One of the steps was to expand who is recommended to get vaccinated. Vaccines customarily are given to build immunity in people before they are ever infected.  But if given within days or even a few weeks of first becoming infected, some vaccines can reduce severity of symptoms. A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, is approved for monkeypox in the U.S. The government has many more doses of an older smallpox vaccine - ACAM2000 - that they say could also be used, but that vaccine is considered to have a greater risk of side effects and is not recommended for people who have HIV. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10965149/Monkeypox-cases-surge-record-63-just-ONE-day-taking-Americas-tally-306.html,The Daily Mail

The 41-year-old man had serious immune system complications and was hospitalized at the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, at the time of his death Thursday. The Health Ministry did not release the man's name, and little is known about when he contracted the monkeypox and how long he had been infected for. A total of 22,124 cases had been reported as of Friday, according to the  World Health Organization  (WHO). Europe has reported 70 percent of those cases, while 25 percent have been tallied in the Americas. Seven deaths have now been reported as part of the outbreak, with Spain reporting its first fatality in the hours following the news from Brazil. The five other deaths all occurred in African nations where the virus is endemic.  A total of 22,124 cases had been reported as of Friday, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Europe has reported 70 percent of those cases, while 25 percent have been tallied in the Americas.

'The immunization schedule must be two doses with an interval of 30 days between them,' Health Ministry Secretary Arnaldo Medeiro said. 'We are already in negotiations with the manufacturers to acquire the immunizers. The (emergency operation center) will monitor the entire pandemic process in relation to monkeypox.' WHO declared monkeypox a 'global health emergency' on July 23. The above graph shows the total number of cases of monkeypox confirmed in the United States.

Some people tend to recover within two to four weeks, according to the WHO. Anyone can spread monkeypox, but the current outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated almost exclusively among men who have sexual intercourse with men. The virus spreads primarily via intimate skin-to-skin contact, usually with someone who has an active rash, as well as via contact with contaminated clothes or bedding. It is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the COVID-19 pandemic. 'COVID is spread by respiratory route and is highly infectious.

"NYC reveals that 95% of monkeypox patients in the Big Apple are men with ZERO women having been infected so far - and at least 60% are 'LGBQ': US case tally reaches 1,470",Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com,2022-07-15 22:13:00,"Monkeypox  infections in  New York City  are overwhelmingly being found in men - with more than half of cases being detected among lesbian, gay, bisexual or queer people as well. Officials in the Big Apple revealed the first snapshot of the demographics of people that have been infected with the tropical virus. Of the 336 cases in the city - the most of any singular locality in America - 321 are among men, with no confirmed cases among women. The remaining five percent of cases are split between  transgender  persons and cases where the gender is unknown.  Transgender people were not included with the LGBQ community in the data.  The virus has famously erupted among communities of gay and bisexual men across the world in recent months after first being detected in Europe, and this data confirms that the community is being hammered by the virus in New York as well. In total, over 11,000 cases have been detected in nations where the virus is not endemic as part of this outbreak - including 1,470 in the U.S. Previous 1 Next             According to  data  from NYC Health, every single person with a confirmed infection in the city is between the ages of 20 and 69, with a median age of 35. The virus has overwhelmingly hurt males in the city. Nearly every case has been confirmed in a male - which would make sense considering the sexual networks where the virus has so far traveled. While no cases have been confirmed among women yet, there are still eight cases where the gender of the person was not recorded. Straight people have largely avoided the virus as well, with only two confirmed cases among the group. Around 60 percent of confirmed cases are in the LGBQ community. Transgender individuals were not included with this group. The sexuality of the infected person was unknown in 40 percent of cases. Monkeypox has spread across racial groups, though. Around one-in-three cases are among white people, with one-in-five found in the Hispanic community. These figures are likely significant undercounts, though, as officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been panned for failing to control the virus. Monkeypox has been allowed to spread undetected because of failures in America's testing and surveillance infrastructure - similar to how Covid was allowed to spread so widely early on when it caught the world off guard in early 2020. Unlike Covid, though, monkeypox is not novel, leaving experts frustrated with how top officials failed to deal with a threat they were already knowledgeable to.  'Why is it so hard for something that's even a known pathogen?' Dr Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA said to the New York Times. 'How many more times do we have to go through this?' America's monkeypox response has been marred by a fractured and limited testing system and limited access to vaccines that could help Americans get ahead of infection. Dozens of people lined up for vaccines against monkeypox in New York City Friday as the city launched its second jabbing drive. The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. At a press briefing last week the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan.  This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. At first, when a person was feeling symptoms of the virus they would be tested locally for the orthopox family of viruses. If positive, their sample would need to be sent to the CDC for confirmation - a process that could take days. This meant that even working as fast as possible, case figures in the U.S. were always going to be days behind. Some of those testing gaps have since been filled, with the CDC announcing in recent days that both Labcorp and the Mayo Clinic had been enlisted in expanding testing capacity. Still, though, access to monkeypox testing is extremely limited and sparse in a nation of over 330 million people. 'It's pretty clear that we need to rapidly scale up the ability to diagnose this now,' said Dr Jay Varma, a Cornell University public health expert who advised the New York City's mayor's office during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some experts are comparing this shortage of testing to where America was early on in the Covid pandemic. One significant difference is that the scientific community had no idea what Covid was when it fist emerged, and how to diagnose it was still unclear. With a virus like monkeypox, which is endemic in some parts of the world and occasionally pops up in the United States, experts believe the same mistakes should not have been repeated again. 'We clearly identified this as a major mistake that allowed Covid to get its footprint in the U.S. and spread undetected for a month, without any of us knowing... and now we're just doing the same thing all over again, because that's the way it's done,' Dr Angela Rasmussen, a public health expert at Canada's University of Saskatchewan told the Times. The rolling out of vaccines has been spotty as well. American officials are believed to have around 800,000 doses of the two-shot Jynneos vaccine - a figure that may not be nearly enough. When vaccines have become available, supply has not been able to meet demand. In New York City - the nation's virus hotspot - walk-in events to receive the jabs often reach maximum demand within minutes of opening. These failures to properly track and prevent spread of the virus has many experts fearing that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., as it has in parts of West and Central Africa.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11018731/NYC-reveals-95-monkeypox-patients-Big-Apple-men.html,The Daily Mail
Where can you get the monkeypox vaccine in the UK?,Jen Mills,2022-07-25 18:41:00,"There have now been over 2,200 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, with the vast majority of them centred in England, specifically  . The virus can affect anyone, with However, it is currently mainly spreading to gay and bisexual men, with people who have multiple sexual partners most at risk. The NHS has started a vaccine rollout to people who could be most likely to get the disease. They are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM), along with the frontline staff at greatest risk of exposure and those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case There are some walk-in clinics around the country, however these are mainly centred in London, where most of the cases have so far been found. If you are looking to find out how you can get a monkeypox vaccine, unfortunately the advice is a little patchy for those outside of the capital. In many areas, the advice is to wait until you are contacted to be given a vaccine. This may be fine for those who are known to their local sexual health clinic, with clinicians able to recognise they are at risk. But for those who may, for example, be new to the area, or haven’t been before, or who have only recently become sexually active, they may not be on the radar of services.  In London there have been long queues outside Guy’s Hospital for walk-in clinics. There have been reports of some people travelling cross-country to get the vaccine, as they were concerned and wanted to get it as soon as possible. Others said they were disappointed at not being able to access it easily elsewhere. Author William Hussey tweeted: ‘It appears there are no walk-in centres in Lincolnshire. I have to wait for a phone appointment with a consultant a week Weds to even begin the process.  ‘Again, rural area of the UK are not like London, Manchester etc for LGBTQ+ people. We are routinely failed. It’s a point I regularly try to make to my urban gay friends but one I am not sure is ever fully appreciated. Our lives are not like yours.’ Last week, it was announced that the vaccine rollout in London is being ‘scaled up’ as this is currently where most cases are spreading. Monkeypox vaccines are also apparently obtainable from the Patrick Clements clinic at Central Middlesex Hospital; email lnwh-tr.pccgeneral@nhs.net to arrange an appointment (no walk-ins at this time) If I find other clinics Iâll update.  There are more than 18 clinics offering vaccinations in the capital including Dean Street sexual health clinic in Soho, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Guy’s Hospital in Southwark, Mortimer Market Centre in Camden and Barking Hospital Outpatient Centre East.  Elsewhere in the UK, clinics in Brighton are offering the vaccine with a walk-in available on Saturdays. The Whittall Street Clinic in Birmingham is also offering the vaccine, and there are seven in the Manchester area. However, these are contacting people directly and not offering walk-ins. The vaccine used in the UK is the smallpox (MVA) vaccination. It was not developed for use in monkeypox specifically, but has a protective effect.  It is designed to be given as two doses, however for now most people are only being given a single dose. So far, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not been as badly hit by the outbreak and consequently are not offering the vaccine as frequently. There have been 30 cases in Wales so far, and 26 in Scotland, with neither country yet offering walk-in clinics. Public Health Scotland said they would be setting out details of their vaccine rollout ‘in due course’. Meanwhile, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: ‘Areas with outbreaks are being prioritised in the distribution of UK-wide supplies of the monkeypox vaccine. ‘Anyone eligible for a pre-exposure vaccination in Wales will be contacted directly by their health board. People concerned about symptoms should contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service.’ The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland said the current process is that those who are eligible for vaccination against monkeypox will be offered the vaccine via the sexual health clinic through their local Health and Social Care Trust. .

"New monkeypox symptoms identified as cases rise to over 2,000 in UK",Jen Mills,2022-07-23 09:06:00,"Researchers have found that some people with monkeypox are not presenting with typical symptoms, and their disease could look more like a typical STI.  A study looking at people diagnosed recently sound that ‘many’ of those infected have only single genital lesions, or they have sores within the mouth or in the anus. The standard symptoms for monkeypox include sores and scabs across the body.  But the   led by Queen Mary University of   said that expecting to see this could be a problem as the disease may not be identified immediately, even by doctors.  ‘In some people, anal and oral symptoms have led to people being admitted to hospital for management of pain and difficulties swallowing,’ they said.  ‘This is why it’s so important that these new clinical symptoms be recognised and healthcare professionals be educated on how to identify and manage the disease – misdiagnosis can slow detection and thus hinder efforts to control the spread of the virus.’ There have now been 2,050 confirmed monkeypox cases across England so far with the majority based in London.  will be accelerating the rollout of the monkeypox vaccine, prioritising individuals who are most likely to get the virus. -led research helped identify those who are most likely to get the virus.     At-risk people hare now eligible to get the vaccine on the NHS, including men who have sex with men, frontline medical staff at greatest risk of exposure, and those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case. Last weekend, clinics in London delivered over 1,000 vaccinations. The new study looked at 528 confirmed infections at 43 sites globally between 27 April and 24 June 2022. At the moment, the disease is disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men, with 98% of people in this group.  But the researchers warned that although sex was the most likely way these patients picked up the virus, it can be transmitted ‘by any close physical contact through large respiratory droplets and potentially through clothing and other surfaces’.  They warned that it’s very important to be able to correctly identify monkeypox because there is a global shortage of both vaccines and treatments. ‘Recognising the disease, contact tracing and advising people to isolate will be key components of the public health response,’ they said. Professor Chloe Orkin, who led the study, said: ‘Viruses know no borders and monkeypox infections have now been described in 70 countries and in more than 13,000 people.  ‘We have shown that the current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa and single ulcers.  ‘These particular symptoms can be severe and have led to hospital admissions so it is important to make a diagnosis. Expanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognise the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.’ Dr John Thornhill, who works treating sexual health issues and is the first author on the study, said: ‘While we expected various skin problems and rashes, we also found that one in ten people had only a single skin lesion in the genital area, and 15 percent had anal and/or rectal pain.  ‘These different presentations highlight that monkeypox infections could be missed or easily confused with common sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis or herpes. We therefore suggest broadening the current case definitions. ‘We have also found monkeypox virus in a large proportion of the semen samples tested from people with monkeypox. However, this may be incidental as we do not know that it is present at a high enough levels to facilitate sexual transmission.  More work is needed to understand this better.’ . Not convinced?

WHO declares monkeypox outbreak a ‘global health emergency’,James Hockaday,2022-07-23 15:21:00,"The monkeypox outbreak has spread to more than 70 countries and is now a ‘global health emergency’, the World Health Organisation says. It was described the WHO as an ‘extraordinary event’ that could spill over into more countries and requires a global response.  The emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak.  Announcements like this in the past have had mixed impact, given that the UN health agency is largely powerless in getting countries to act. Monkeypox has been in parts of central and west Africa for decades, but it was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent, or to spread widely among people. But in May authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere –  , where the most at-risk are now eligible for a vaccine.  More than 2,500 cases have been recorded in the US, and the country has  According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox have been reported in 74 countries since about May. Last month, the WHO’s expert committee said the worldwide monkeypox outbreak did not yet amount to an international emergency, but the panel convened this week to reevaluate the situation. It has previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. To date, monkeypox deaths have only been reported in Africa, where a more dangerous version of the virus is spreading, mainly in Nigeria and Congo. In the continent, monkeypox mainly spreads to people from infected wild animals like rodents, in limited outbreaks that typically have not crossed borders.   will be accelerating the rollout of the monkeypox vaccine, prioritising individuals who are most likely to get the virus. -led research helped identify those who are most likely to get the virus.     In Europe, North America and elsewhere, however, monkeypox is spreading among people with no links to animals or recent travel to Africa. The WHO’s top monkeypox expert, Dr. Rosamund Lewis, said this week that 99% of all the monkeypox cases beyond Africa were in men and that of those, 98% involved men who have sex with men.  Experts suspect the monkeypox outbreaks in Europe and North America were spread via sex at two raves in Belgium and Spain. Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said it was surprising WHO hadn’t already declared monkeypox a global emergency, explaining that the conditions were arguably met weeks ago. Some experts have questioned whether such a declaration would help, arguing the disease isn’t severe enough to warrant the attention. They added that rich countries battling monkeypox already have the funds to do so; most people recover without needing medical attention, although the lesions may be painful. ‘I think it would be better to be proactive and overreact to the problem instead of waiting to react when it’s too late,’ Mr Head said.  He added that the WHO’s emergency declaration could help donors like the World Bank make funds available to stop the outbreaks both in the West and in Africa, where animals are the likely natural reservoir of monkeypox. In the US, some experts have speculated whether monkeypox might be on the verge of becoming an entrenched sexually transmitted disease in the country, like gonorrhea, herpes and HIV. ‘The bottom line is we’ve seen a shift in the epidemiology of monkeypox where there’s now widespread, unexpected transmission,’ said Dr Albert Ko, a professor of public health and epidemiology at Yale University. ‘There are some genetic mutations in the virus that suggest why that may be happening, but we do need a globally-coordinated response to get it under control,’ he said. Dr Ko called for testing to be immediately scaled up rapidly, saying that similar to the early days of Covid-19, that there were significant gaps in surveillance. He said: ‘The cases we are seeing are just the tip of the iceberg. The window has probably closed for us to quickly stop the outbreaks in Europe and the US. ‘But it’s not too late to stop monkeypox from causing huge damage to poorer countries without the resources to handle it.’ Dr. Placide Mbala, a virologist who directs the global health department at Congo’s Institute of National Biomedical Research, said he hoped any global efforts to stop monkeypox would be equitable.  Although countries including Britain, Canada, Germany and the US have ordered millions of vaccine doses, none have gone to Africa. ‘The solution needs to be global,’ Mbala said, adding that any vaccines sent to Africa would be used to target those at highest risk, like hunters in rural areas. He added: ‘Vaccination in the West might help stop the outbreak there, but there will still be cases in Africa. ‘Unless the problem is solved here, the risk to the rest of the world will remain.’ .

Spain confirms Europe’s first known monkeypox-related death of outbreak,Sam Corbishley,2022-07-29 20:50:00,"Spain has reported its first monkeypox-related death in what is thought to be Europe’s first known fatality from the disease and the second outside of Africa in the current outbreak. The World Health Organization said in a report last week that five deaths had been reported worldwide – all in the African region. Brazil reported the first monkeypox-related death outside the continent earlier on Friday. The WHO last Saturday declared the rapidly spreading outbreak a global health emergency, its highest level of alert. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there are now more than 16,000 reported cases from 75 countries and territories. In its latest report, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country. Of the 3,750 patients it had information on, it said 120 had been hospitalised – accounting for 3.2% – and one had died, without providing further details. A spokesperson for the Health Ministry declined to give further details on the deceased person. Monkeypox is related to smallpox and cases are usually found in West and Central Africa, with the virus not often spreading elsewhere. That is why outbreaks reported in multiple countries, including the UK and across Europe, caused alarm among public health experts. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue, but some may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off. Most people recover within a few weeks. The incubation period of monkeypox is usually from six to 13 days, but can range from five to 21 days. The most likely route of transmission is close physical contact, touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, or touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs. There is a smaller risk of it being spread through coughs and sneezes, and as prolonged face-to-face contact would be needed, this is not one of the main routes. Sexual intercourse is thought to expose people to a higher risk of contracting the disease as, although it is not known to be sexually transmitted, the close physical contact involved means exposure is more likely. A majority of the cases seen so far have been in gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men. The type of monkeypox involved in the outbreak is a West African variety said to be fatal in only one per cent of cases. The UK Health Security Agency said that, after the WHO declaration of a global emergency, the risk to the UK remains the same. As of July 21, there were 2,208 confirmed cases in the UK. Of those, 2,115 were in England, with a high proportion of cases in London. UKHSA guidance for close contacts of a confirmed monkeypox case has been updated to advise that close contacts do not need to isolate at home if they do not have symptoms. Close contacts are advised to call NHS 111 or a sexual health clinic if they develop a fever or any monkeypox symptoms, and to avoid skin-to-skin contact with others, avoid international travel if possible and to let health or dental facility staff know they are a close contact before attending appointments. Because it can take up to three weeks for symptoms to appear after being in contact with someone with monkeypox, people are advised to stay alert for symptoms after having skin-to-skin or sexual contact with someone new. .

US now leads world in known monkeypox cases as New York and San Francisco declare emergencies,Zachary Folk,2022-07-29 21:48:00,"The US is now leading the world in monkeypox cases in countries where the disease is not endemic. The US has 4,097 cases across 47 states, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published on Thursday. The report was written by the   at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday. Since then, the US has added another 1,420 cases. Last week, the World Health Organization declared the virus a global emergency. On Thursday, New York and San Francisco declared it a local emergency as cases continue to rise and demand for vaccines has outpaced supply. As of Friday, 1,383 monkeypox cases have been confirmed in New York. Of those cases, 1,289 were detected in New York City. New York Commissioner of Health Mary Bassett declared monkeypox an imminent threat, authorizing local health departments to perform ‘case investigation support, contact identification and monitoring, vaccine administration for exposed contacts and current high risk populations, and education and outreach’. San Francisco Mayor London Breed also  her government’s plan to fight monkeypox. Breed was clear that the city would not implement ‘behavior restrictions’ like it did during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the city would focus on using the emergency declaration to free up resources to fight the virus. ‘During Covid, we used our Local Emergency to pop up emergency vaccine sites. To deploy workers to immediate needs. To enter into emergency contracts. To be able to move government bureaucracy nimbly to confront the virus,’ wrote Breed. ‘That’s the kind of actions this Local Emergency will allow us to do.’ The second largest outbreak internationally is in Spain, where 3,738 cases have been confirmed. Germany currently has 2,540 and the UK recorded 2,432. Monkeypox is considered endemic to Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration approved nearly 800,000 more doses of the monkeypox vaccine to be distributed throughout the country. Over 300,000 doses were already distributed to various state and local health departments, but demand has quickly outpaced supply. Clinics in Washington, DC, recently   scheduled for some patients due to ‘very limited supply’. . Not convinced?

Monkeypox: What is a global health emergency as WHO declares one?,Evelyn Richards,2022-07-24 10:12:00,"The World Health Organization (WHO)   on Saturday (July 23). The news comes as the  . WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the risk of monkeypox was moderate globally, except in Europe, where the WHO has deemed the risk as high. But what exactly is a global health emergency, and has one been declared before? Here is everything you need to know. A global emergency is the WHO’s highest level of alert. Officially known as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the status marks an escalation in the response to the disease. The designation means the WHO now views the outbreak as a significant enough threat to global health that urgent action is required to  and potentially escalating into a pandemic. The declaration is designed to trigger international response, and could lead to funding to collaborate on  . Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC. Before a global health emergency is declared, the WHO’s emergency committee meets to weigh the evidence and make a recommendation to the director general.  The committee met last month to discuss declaring monkeypox a global emergency, but decided against it. At that time, there were 3,040 cases in 47 countries. However, since then, the situation has quickly accelerated – there are now 16,000 cases in 75 countries, with five deaths recorded. They met again on Thursday and were split on the decision, with nine members against and six in favour of the declaration – prompting Tedros to break the deadlock.

I had monkeypox – I’ve been through hell and back,Raphael C,2022-07-28 15:51:00,"The past fortnight has been poxy, both literally and figuratively.  I type these words on the day my agonising two-week   sentence comes to an end, with a confusing mix of sadness and joy.  The first because, as we learned during  , mandatory self-isolation leaves its captive with something neighbouring Stockholm Syndrome.  The second because I’ll be allowed outside – helping me avoid real prison time for the strangulation of my over-attentive partner. I strongly suggest he does not ditch the day job for full-time care! My symptoms kicked off with stomach cramps and aching muscles, which I respectively put down to an excess of rich food and a strenuous gym sesh in the days before.  Fever symptoms then joined the party, and although a Covid lateral flow test displayed only a single red line, I erred on the side of caution and cancelled that evening’s plans.  The following day, a spot appeared on my forehead. Nothing new, so I treated it with   from my   mini apothecary.  The first real clue that something more sinister was afoot came when the zit, which had developed a small crater, began to resemble Vesuvius. Oh dear, was it a monkeypox lesion?  Google Images suggested that, yes, it could well be, but a search engine is no substitute for a medical professional.  I called Homerton Hospital, where a doctor initially suspected I was suffering from nothing worse than  .  However, she later phoned back to say her colleague, a consultant, disagreed, and I was told to come in for a test.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

						 Confusion ensued after I was told to travel the three-mile distance by foot. So I masked my shame (another key character in this tale) with a plaster and took  , having been instructed by the doctor to stick to a quiet carriage and keep my distance. On arrival, I was greeted by a nurse and accompanied to what I reckon was a designated monkeypox room.  ‘Don’t touch anything, thanks. Sorry, you understand.’  After two years of Covid, I was certainly familiar with this dance, but it still left me feeling slightly like a rabid mole-rat. A doctor collected a sample, confirmed the spot was indeed lesion-like, and sent me off to isolate at home until the results came back.  Later that evening, the situation shifted from a little gloomy to proper grim, on the discovery of a second, much more painful lesion, and in a much more private area. There was no doubt about it, I had monkeypox. It was staring back at me in the bathroom mirror.  I fixated on the unusual presentation of my infection.  These two lesions had surfaced days apart, but most patients, so says the internet, get them in the same location all at once.  My  , which had been gently simmering until then, grew to a rolling boil. Would I soon look like a Domino’s order? Would I end up permanently scarred? As it turns out, no and no, thank goodness.  In the three days that it took for the test results to verify what I already knew, the lesion on the dark side of the moon quickly graduated from sore to excruciating.  Neither ibuprofen nor paracetamol took the edge off to let me sleep or work..  Luckily – and I’m so grateful for this – the fantastic team at Homerton had been checking in every day to make sure I was coping. ‘Cocodamol should do the trick’, I was advised.  And to some extent, it did, though the physical and mental distress persisted. I’ll tell you what I’m not grateful for, though: the   (UKHSA). By this time, a full week into the horror-house funfair ride that is monkeypox, they hadn’t been in touch once.  I’d expected a call for contact tracing purposes and perhaps even for my partner to access the smallpox vaccine. Nope! I was left worrying he’d catch it, but by the grace of some deity he didn’t.  When UKHSA did finally bother to drop me a line, the call handler asked a series of questions, including my sexuality and where I could have contracted monkeypox.  I told them I suspected that I caught it at the gym, which is normally where I’m surrounded by the highest concentration of people.  My answer was met with a chuckle followed by what I heard as, ‘It must have been a particularly slutty gym.’ Erm, surely I’d misheard. Could she repeat herself? Ditto. I was flabbergasted but carried on regardless, only processing the severity of what I’d perceived to have happened once the conversation ended.  I suggest those at risk get the jab as soon as possible to avoid my fate Afterwards, I emailed the call handler to complain, explaining that her question was especially distressing as it came: first, in a climate where the current monkeypox outbreak is widely perceived as a ‘ ’; and second, right after UKHSA downgraded its classification of the virus from ‘a high consequence infectious disease’ despite rising cases.  It wasn’t long before a senior comms officer reached out to let me know the call handler had, in fact, said, ‘It must have been a particularly   gym’.  Anyway, this hellish imbroglio aside, my torture eventually subsided and I returned to work (remotely).  The long wait to de-isolate then commenced. Scabs soon formed on my lesions and, after clinging on like Boris Johnson in Number 10, eventually fell off.  This gave me the much-needed green light to re-enter society, where I found the perfect sun-drenched coffee shop patio to write this article.  The World Health Organisation just declared monkeypox ‘ ,’ so I suggest those at risk get the jab as soon as possible to avoid my fate.  There are now a number of monkeypox vaccine pop-ups across the UK, but many of them have been extremely overwhelmed since opening. Some people have reportedly been forced to travel out of their home city to access the jab, while others say they have been turned away.  The government has promised to accelerate the vaccine’s rollout, but it remains to be seen whether this effort will be better coordinated than it is at present. Monkeypox is here, it’s happening, and we can no longer avoid that fact.

But what exactly is monkeypox, and what are the key symptoms that you need to look out for? Here is everything you need to know. A rare infection, monkeypox is described as zoonotic – meaning it is normally seen in animals. However, the disease can spread to humans from an infected animal if you’re bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters, or scabs. The infection is a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. It’s not common for monkeypox to spread from person to person. But, according to the  , it  : According to the  , a rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection – generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off. Between one and 21 days after infection, you may experience the following symptoms: All in all, symptoms can last around two to four weeks.

If you’re concerned about having symptoms, the NHS advises you to stay home, avoid close contact (or sharing towels/bedding) with other people, and call (not visit in person) your local sexual health clinic. If you can’t reach a sexual health clinic, call 111 for advice. Treatment takes place in a specialist hospital to prevent the spread of monkeypox. There is no single cure for monkeypox, so treatment is largely focused on relieving symptoms. This includes lowering your temperature, easing pain, and taking antibiotics to help fight the infection. Most people with the infection will make a full recovery within two to four weeks. There isn’t a specific vaccine for monkeypox. However, the   – a more severe virus which has since been eradicated – is said to offer protection. the jab was ‘demonstrated through observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox’.

Concerning surge of monkeypox in London with cased doubling in a week,Kirsten Robertson,2022-07-15 06:39:00,"Sadiq Khan has urged for action after 71% of recent monkeypox cases were reported in London. The city’s mayor says he is ‘deeply concerned’ about the sudden rise. Between May 6 and July 11 this year, there have been 1,735 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK. The majority, 1,229 were Londoners, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures. This compares with only seven cases recorded in the UK between 2018 and 2021. Mr Khan has written to the recently appointed Health Secretary,  , urging the Government to take action. This follows calls by health charities including the National Aids Trust and the Terrence Higgins Trust for the NHS and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) to combat the outbreak as soon as possible. Mr Khan said: ‘London is currently seeing the highest rate of infection and I’m deeply concerned that reported monkeypox cases have doubled in less than a week. ‘If we have learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s that early action and coordination is vital to get ahead of the curve. ‘The Government must rapidly ensure that there’s a coordinated and resourced approach to tackle the threat faced by monkeypox now.’ Most people affected by the virus during this year’s outbreak have been men, at 99.4%, according to the UKHSA. For confirmed cases where gender information was available, 1,633 were men and only 10 women. Monkeypox is related to smallpox and cases are usually found in West and Central Africa, with the virus not often spreading elsewhere. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases.

Scientists develop PCR test that detects Monkeypox in 90 minutes,Anugraha Sundaravelu,2022-06-29 12:50:00,"Scientists have developed a PCR test that detects the  virus in 90 minutes. The test, developed by South Korean diagnostics firm Seegene, will help countries in monitoring the spread of the virus and curb community transmission. The World Health Organisation expects cases to rise this summer with health officials warning that transmission in Europe could be ‘amplified’ by big events like festivals. The European office of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that Europe is at the ‘epicentre’ of the ‘largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported’ outside of western and central Africa.

"Monkeypox mutating 12 times faster than expected, experts warn",Jasper King,2022-06-28 10:31:00,"Monkeypox may be mutating at an abnormally fast rate, experts have warned. The virus has replicated up to 12 times faster than expected since 2018, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found. The study, which is pending official publication, looked at 15 samples of the monkeypox virus. The NIH team restructured the genetic information of the virus to detect the number of changes it had undergone since the strain entered into circulation. While the virus is spread by physical touch, contaminated surfaces or very close bodily contact, this research means it could also spread in ways which do not follow its normal pattern. More than 3,500 cases have been detected across the world so far, and as of June 23, 910 cases have been reported across the UK. It is currently present in some 50 countries. Occasionally, non-endemic countries detect a small amount of cases at any given time. For example, in the US in 2021, two cases of monkeypox were detected. But the more recent outbreak – which has seen cases detected across multiple countries – suggests this may be a more infectious strain of the virus. Researchers believe the West African variant of monkeypox first started moving across the world in 2018. Unlike Covid, DNA viruses such as monkeypox are not known to rapidly mutate. There are currently 201 cases of the virus in the US – but experts warn this is a severe undercount to the actual number of cases. It is believed cases could become endemic across the US, UK and Europe. It is thought most outbreaks across the US and Europe have been detected among gay and bisexual men. The UK Health Security Agency recommended gay and bisexual men  . The smallpox vaccine Imvanex is expected to be offered, which is shown to be effective against monkeypox.

British Airways crew forced to isolate after one tests positive for monkeypox,Faye Brown,2022-06-22 09:03:00,"An entire British Airways crew is having to isolate for three weeks after one of them tested positive for monkeypox in Singapore.  Two pilots and nine stewards and stewardesses have all been put in quarantine for 21 days, it is understood.  The group were tested for the rapidly spreading disease on Sunday evening, when they stopped in the south east Asian country on the way back from Australia.  A BA insider told Mail Online: ‘One of them had it, so they impounded the whole crew. Now they have got to spend 21 days in quarantine.  ‘Everyone has been told not to talk about it – but it’s all everyone is talking about.’  The positive result reportedly came on the return leg of a London-Sydney flight.  After completing the outward journey, the group had a one-day stop over in the Australian city before returning to the UK via Singapore.  A BA spokesman said: ‘We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require.’ It comes after the UK Health Security Agency (HSA) recommended that gay and bisexual men at high risk of catching monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine.  Experts have warned that Britain’s monkeypox outbreak is continuing to grow and is still not under control.  Although anyone can catch it, data shows there is a higher level of transmission among men who have sex with other men.  The UK has more infections than any other country impacted by the spread of the virus and has now seen the biggest explosion ever recorded outside Africa. Health officials confirmed last week the number of cases has risen to 574 since the first was identified on May 7. . Not convinced?

Gay and bisexual men at higher risk to be offered monkeypox vaccine,Jen Mills,2022-06-21 16:43:00,"Gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered vaccines, the UK Health Security Agency has recommended. Those at higher risk of exposure will be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, which is shown to be effective against monkeypox. The strategy is endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which was consulted on the eligibility criteria for the vaccine. Eligibility would depend on a number of factors but would be similar to the criteria used to assess those eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) – but applied regardless of HIV status. Someone who, for example, has multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends ‘sex on premises’ venues could be eligible. NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated shortly. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: ‘Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  ‘By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. ‘Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet. Alex Sparrowhawk, Health Promotion Specialist at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘This targeted vaccination programme is a positive move forward while the data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK.’ Robbie de Santos, director of communications and at Stonewall, said: ‘While we know anyone can catch monkeypox, we welcome the vaccine being offered to those gay and bi men who are eligible and currently at a higher risk of getting the virus. ‘It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others. Let’s help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season.’ While the vaccine is rolled out and afterwards, people have been warned to continue to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have had close contact with a new partner.  If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending. . Not convinced?

US authorizes change in how monkeypox vaccines injected to increase access fivefold,Zachary Folk,2022-08-09 21:30:00,"US health officials have announced an emergency authorization to change the way the monkeypox vaccine is administered to patients in order to increase access fivefold. The emergency authorization on Tuesday will allow providers to administer the Jynneos vaccine intradermally – injecting the shot in the upper layer of skin instead of deeper into the tissue. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said that today’s announcement would take the government’s response ‘to the next level.’ ‘Today’s action will allow FDA to exercise additional authorities that may increase availability of vaccines to prevent monkeypox while continuing to ensure the vaccine meets high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality,’ Becerra stated.

Desperate battle to stop monkeypox from becoming an epidemic,Jordan King,2022-08-05 13:30:00,"LGBTQ+ groups are pleading with the Government to work to stop the monkeypox virus from becoming endemic.  The World Health Organisation  last month and the  .  The UK has not taken any similar steps and health authorities have urged the need for calm, with 2,672 confirmed cases and 87 highly probable cases as of Monday. Now, LGBTQ+ activists from the Conservatives, Labour, the  , the Greens and the Scottish National Party have written a letter to health secretary   to ask for more action.  The majority of monkeypox cases have been found in gay and bisexual men and the spread is ‘causing real fear and anxiety’ within communities.  The letter said: ‘We are united as LGBT+ groups from across political parties in asking that the Government treat the monkeypox outbreak as a public health emergency. ‘We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.’ The letter went on to call for ‘clear, non-stigmatising messaging, delivered direct’ to LGBTQ+ communities.  The groups believe the messaging should be ‘about the symptoms of monkeypox and what to do if you suspect you have the virus to inform and reassure people, rather than the current broadcast-to-all approach that constantly mentions GBMSM (gay and bisexual and other men who have sex with men)’.  The letter also called for the vaccination of those most at risk.  It read: ‘We are very worried that while mass vaccination events are a great way of building confidence that vaccinations are happening they can be a driver of inequality, especially when there is an under-supply of jabs. ‘It is time to get improved systems and more purchasing of this much-needed vaccine.’ If you’re eligible for the monkeypox vaccine, we will contact you to come forward and get it.ï¿¼ Watch sexual health consultant Dr Rachael Jones explain who will be offered the vaccine, how people will be contacted and why it is important to get it â¬ï¸ The Terrence Higgins Trust, a HIV and sexual health charity, added to these calls when it said: ‘We need to see far better coordination, increased vaccine procurement, improved delivery and a cash injection to sexual health services to treat monkeypox that will also reverse the impact the outbreak is already having on STI testing and treatment, PrEP provision and contraception services.’ The NHS announced late last month it was stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab became available. Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex.

UK ‘on the verge of running out of monkeypox vaccines’,Gergana Krasteva,2022-08-09 21:07:00,"Britain will run out of monkeypox vaccines in about two to three weeks, a report has claimed. Weeks after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the virus outbreak to be a global health emergency, there are concerns the LGBTQ+ communities most vulnerable to the viral infection could be left stranded. , only a little more than 8,300 doses of vaccine are left, according to an internal NHS letter cited by the  .  Shipments of a new order of 100,000 doses will not resume until September, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) told Metro.co.uk in a statement. Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said that at current levels of demand the UK was ‘likely’ to run out of the jabs in about 10 to 20 days. ‘It was thought the number needing vaccination would be lower than we are seeing in clinic and demand is high,’ she said. According to the latest figures available for July 25 and 31, a total of 5,206 cases were reported around the world. In the UK, there had been 2,859 confirmed and highly probable cases of the viral disease as of last Thursday. But last week, the UKHSA said cases in the country are ‘plateauing’.  Global stocks of the smallpox vaccine used to combat monkeypox are limited due to the historically low prevalence of cases outside of countries where the virus has been endemic for many years. Dr Mary Ramsay, director of clinical programmes at UKHSA, said: ‘UKHSA moved early to procure over 150,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine from the global manufacturer to meet expected demand in the UK.  ‘Around 50,000 of these have been received to date and made available to the NHS for distribution across the country.  ‘The roll out is continuing at pace, with the vaccine being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox in order to offer them protection and to help contain the current outbreak. ‘The thousands of vaccines administered by the NHS to date among those at highest risk of exposure should have a significant impact on the transmission of the virus.’ .

I’m scared people will mistake my eczema for monkeypox and shame me online,Liam Beattie,2022-08-05 16:36:00,"Imagine getting on a train and someone filming your body, then posting it to social media and hypothesising you had monkeypox. For Lilly Simon – an everyday person who just happened to board the subway in New York – this was her reality. But she didn’t have monkeypox, she has a skin condition called neurofibromatosis 1, which she later clarified via   last week after being called out. This incident immediately frightened me because, as someone with a skin condition myself, I worried I could be next. Social media is now driving a chilling trend of photos being taken of people’s skin – usually their legs – at a distance and posted with speculation about whether they have monkeypox and if they should be self-isolating. People with skin conditions are now being targeted and shamed by trigger-happy Twitter users who can’t resist jumping to conclusions about someone’s health and their assumed ‘reckless’ behaviour. That’s despite the fact that, while possible, it is unlikely that the virus would spread easily between people without direct contact. Either way, there’s almost certainly no risk from someone standing on the opposite side of the train carriage. These kinds of photos have been condemned by leading skin experts at the British Association of Dermatologists, warning that this ‘adds to the stigma around the disease, which is enormously unhelpful; it is also the sort of thing that adds to the psychological burden of people living with a visible skin condition.’ Sadly, this type of unwanted attention isn’t new to me. I’ve had severe eczema all my life – I’ve been in and out of hospital and suffered poor mental health. Photos of me as a toddler show that, just as my teeth were coming through, so were red blotchy marks that would stay with me into adulthood. My parents were worried about taking too many photos of me at the time, feeling upset that they weren’t able to make the horrendous itching and crying stop. In school, I regularly faced being shouted at by teachers for refusing to take my jumper off in the summer heat. My arms would be covered in red marks, scratches and broken skin. The jumper would be my only armour from comments by classmates. Navigating the turbulence of teenage years – coupled with days when I couldn’t even hold a pen because my fingers were so sore – resulted in my mental health spiralling. I locked myself in my bedroom for days, ashamed of my appearance and blaming myself for looking the way I did. Even my sex life doesn’t get a free pass. When I was single, I’d often usher guys out first thing in the morning – not offering the pleasantries of tea and a chat – because my sheets would be spotted in blood from my scratching during the night. The embarrassment was just too much that I’d stop having sex when my eczema was at its worst. That’s why photos and discourse of people’s skin being played out for Twitter likes stings so much. The worry about being cross-examined in public for social media fodder fills me with worry. It’s taken me to the age of 30 to finally start to feel comfortable showing my imperfect skin in public and now anxiety – which is in itself a key cause of skin conditions becoming inflamed and even more itchy – is giving me second thoughts about what I should be wearing. When my skin is bad, there’s already a worry about people looking at me – even though they’re probably not. But now, thanks to the heady combination of monkeypox and Twitter, it’s horrible to think that maybe they are. It’s estimated that around half of people with a skin condition experience some degree of distress, with a recent report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Skin warning that access to mental health services urgently needs to be addressed by the NHS. That means there are a lot of people who are unable to access the support they need to manage their skin and mental health. During this period of increased anxiety for many of us, the need for unequivocal information about monkeypox and looking after ourselves is needed even more. Since monkeypox has recently prominently emerged in the UK, social media has been a tool to help men who have sex with men rally together to share the latest information about where to get ahold of the vaccine. This is because the UK Government has shamefully still not centralised their vaccine effort. But social media is also being used as a surveillance tool to embarrass others who have any visible marks on their body. Videos and photos of people zooming in on people’s legs and arms – jumping to a conclusion that this person may have monkeypox – is deeply harmful and is shaming innocent people for their perceived reckless behaviour, when it couldn’t be further from reality. I consider myself lucky that this week, I was able to put my worries and questions to a dermatologist, and get a definitive answer on whether I could get the monkeypox vaccine. Because people with skin conditions aren’t just at risk of a trial by social media, there’s also contradictory information about the safety of the vaccine for people with eczema. My doctor calmly explained that the vaccine was perfectly safe and she said that I should go forward to get my jab. That was a relief and something doctors need to be shouting about. The next week is set to be another warm spell and I plan to stay cool and let my skin breathe. Please don’t make any assumptions about my skin – or anyone else’s. Instead, spend that time learning the facts about monkeypox from reputable sources such as Terrence Higgins Trust and Queer Health, to dispel the myths about the virus and know how to protect ourselves during this outbreak. Doing so will help more of us feel comfortable in our own skin.

Glastonbury 2022: How to keep safe from monkeypox,Caroline Westbrook,2022-06-21 14:24:00,"Thousands of revellers are set to descend upon Worthy Farm in the coming days as the   returns to the site for the first time since 2019. The annual music event – whose headliners this year include  , Sir   and Kendrick Lamar – was among many festivals shelved in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. And while Covid remains a concern,   has also raised fears among many – with the World Health Organisation previously warning that  At time of writing there were 504   – and although the risk to the general public remains low, this is likely to increase at any sort of mass gathering, particularly one such as Glastonbury with around 200,000 people in attendance. But if you’re heading for Worthy Farm – or any other music festival this summer – what steps can you take to keep yourself safe?  may be a concern if you are going to a music festival or any other mass gathering, there are steps you can take to keep yourself safe – even before you arrive. Here’s what you can do to ensure you keep your health on an even keel. Health Expert Stephanie Taylor   told that making sure you are well-rested before you arrive is vital. ‘To prepare your immune system for five days of excessive drinking, no sleep and a lot of walking, you might want to get a couple of early nights over the next few days,’ she says. ‘Quality sleep is essential for boosting your immune system against threats, with several studies revealing that the risk of infections is higher for those with sleep deprivation.’ She also advises festivalgoers to eat properly – making the most of tinned food and choosing healthy meals and snacks, especially if self-catering. ‘While fresh foods are a no-no, you’d be surprised by the nutritional value you can get from tinned foods. For example, tinned vegetables like carrot, peas and sweetcorn will provide you with plenty of vitamins, while tinned meat has protein and carbs and beans, pulses, or cereal bars are high in fibre and other nutrients.’ It also goes without saying that you should drink plenty of water – around three litres a day if possible.  ‘If you have a standard 500ml plastic water bottle, drink six bottles throughout the day. Drinking plenty will give you more energy, keep you cool and help prevent sickness,’ Stephanie says. Stephanie recommends that those going to Glasto should pack essentials to protect them from health threats – such as hand sanitiser, a mini first-aid kit and vitamins in sealed bottles. ‘When you’re at the festival, don’t let your hygiene slip as this is how you can damage your immune system,’ Stephanie explains. ‘Ensure you wash your hands with soap and water (when you can) and always carry hand sanitiser around with you. Hand sanitisers with a higher volume of alcohol are better, as they are a more effective disinfectant that breaks up the outer coating of bacteria and viruses.’ You should also try and avoid sharing foods, drinks and utensils or clothes with others – and avoid touching your face too often, as this is a way for pathogens to enter your body through your eyes, nose or mouth. While it is not a sexually transmitted disease (STI), the monkeypox virus can be   – it can be transmitted through skin lesions, respiratory droplets or fomite from an infected person. And if you’re feeling unwell, visit one of the medical facilities on-site, who will be able to offer you the best advice for your symptoms. Pippa Murphy, sex and relationship expert at  , tells  ‘With monkeypox on the rise, this is another reason why you should wear a condom.  ‘The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has suggested that those who previously had the virus should use condoms for eight weeks after infection, so it’s important to consider this when having sex with someone whose medical healthy history you don’t know.’ Good hygiene is also important, with Pippa also recommending the use of hand sanitiser and antibacterial wipes, wet wipes and a breath spray or mouth wash, to minimise the risks associated with skin-to-skin contact. However, she also stresses that – while it might seem awkward – the best way to  stay safe during a sexual encounter with a fellow festivalgoer is to ask them if they have had monkeypox symptoms. Whilst this may seem like a mood killer, it’s incredibly important to ask these questions to protect your health and prevent the spread of both infections. Ask them if they have any Covid-19 or monkeypox symptoms or had any in the previous two weeks and the same for anyone in their household.

						 ‘If they’re considerate, they’ll answer your question with no qualms, however, if they get defensive, this is a major red flag that they may have had either virus or at least not care about the practice of safe sex. They’re, therefore, not worthy of your time.’ According to the  , a rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection – generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off. Between one and 21 days after infection, you may experience the following symptoms: There is no single cure for monkeypox, so treatment is largely focused on relieving symptoms – including lowering your temperature, easing pain, and taking antibiotics to help fight the infection. Most people with the infection will make a full recovery within two to four weeks, although complications can develop in some people who contract the virus – such as children and pregnant women.

The US’s declaration comes more than a week after the World Health Organization (WHO) called the outbreak a global health emergency. My symptoms kicked off with stomach cramps and aching muscles, which I respectively put down to an excess of rich food and a strenuous gym sesh in the days before.  Fever symptoms then joined the party, and although a Covid lateral flow test displayed only a single red line, I erred on the side of caution and cancelled that evening’s plans.  The following day, a spot appeared on my forehead.  The first real clue that something more sinister was afoot came when the zit, which had developed a small crater, began to resemble Vesuvius.  WHO defines a public health emergency as ‘an extraordinary event’ posing a ‘public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease’ that could ‘potentially require a coordinated international response’. A quarter of the monkeypox cases in the US are in New York, which last week declared a state of emergency. On Monday, California and Illinois also declared emergencies.  More than 99% of the cases have been found in men who have sex with men. The average age of patients is 35.

						 A second monkeypox death has been confirmed in Spain, health officials said. It is thought to be the third death outside Africa since the virus began to spread further afield earlier this year. Spain reported its first death on Friday, shortly after Brazil confirmed the first monkeypox-related fatality of the current epidemic.  In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country.  Of the 3,750 patients on which it had information, 120 or 3.2% had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said without providing further details. The Brazilian patient was a 41-year-old man who also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. The World Health Organisation has dubbed the outbreak a global health emergency and governments around the world are racing to contain it. Experts believe the virus, which passes from human to human during close contact, is being primarily transmitted sexually, with the bulk of cases being found in men who have sex with other men. UK health officials said there more than 2,500 confirmed and suspected cases as of Thursday, with all but a few dozen in England. Governments are buying up doses of the smallpox vaccine, which has been shown to provide protection against the virus. But there have been warnings this week that rich countries stockpiling the treatment could lead to shortages in African regions where the disease is endemic. On Thursday, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for the continent to be prioritised for vaccines, saying it was again being left behind.

So far, the majority of cases have been found in London. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said a further 104 cases had been confirmed in England as of June 12, since the previous report on Friday.  There are currently 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and four in Wales. In a briefing, the UKHSA said they had interviewed people who had contracted monkeypox to try to understand how it was spreading.  Of the cases interviewed, 81% were London residents and 99% were male. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. In total, 152 cases participated in more detailed questionnaires. In this data, 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same sex contact.  Recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within Europe.

The majority of cases continue to be among men who have sex with other men, leading some to call for smallpox vaccines to be offered to that group. Clinical data shows treatments designed to inoculate against smallpox, a related and more severe illness, are effective against monkeypox. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told  : ‘At the moment there is no clear evidence that the current epidemic is coming under control.’ Professor Jimmy Whitworth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine agreed the outbreak is growing, telling the paper ‘super-spreading events’ have played a role, as well as ‘some cases without any obvious signs of infection’. With Glastonbury set to start this weekend, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is concerned about the risk of infections at big summer festivals and events. Monkeypox, which causes blisters on the skin, spreads through close physical contact, including through sexual activity. The UKHSA has previously said the outbreak’s link to casual sex has made the chain of infection harder to trace. A report noted: ‘Traditional contact tracing as a primary control intervention in this specific group will be challenging as most cases reported having sexual contact with new or casual partners, sometimes in the context of cruising grounds or during chemsex, frequently where contact details were unavailable for tracing.’ A UKHSA spokesperson said: ‘If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact.  ‘Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.  ‘Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been seen by a clinician.’ .

"ICYMI: Rail strikes, abortion rights and polio – this week’s five top stories, explained",Jordan King,2022-06-25 07:00:00,"Ah Saturday morning – a time to sit down with a cup of coffee and read some good old fashioned news.  Well old fashioned is certainly right.  Metro readers are in for a treat with an extremely vintage virus knocking about in  ’s sewers. And of course, what could be more retro than the oppression of women’s rights?  Terms and conditions do apply to this groovy time machine ride, including some more modern stories on rail strikes and elections.  But, as always, Metro.co.uk promises to provide the most important service it can during these times: An animal story at the end.  Anyone brave enough to use public transport last week will know how chaotic things have been as the country faced its largest rail strike in 30 years.  Some 40,000 railway workers walked out on Tuesday, Thursday and today, bringing about half of the network to a halt.  A separate Tube strike also took place on Tuesday and the Overground, buses and roads were forced to fill in the gaps and get people around the country.   told its customers to only travel if it is ‘absolutely necessary’.  The  ’s members are striking over pay, working conditions, job cuts and pensions.  RMT general secretary   said workers want an increase that ‘reflects the cost of living crisis’.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote: ‘The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by constitutional provision.’ The automatic right to abortion provision will therefore not be set at a federal level and states can make their own laws.  Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that take immediate effect once Roe is struck down that ban or severely limit access to abortion.  Another six states have near total bans after six weeks of pregnancy — long before many people know they are pregnant. Alternatively, 16 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws protecting the right to have an abortion even without Roe. Roe’s overturning was made possible by three conservative judges appointed by former President Donald Trump. Boris Johnson has since ’.

Monkeypox status upgraded meaning stricter rules in place when people catch it,Jen Mills,2022-06-07 15:39:00,"Doctors must report any suspected case of monkeypox under new rules, it was announced today. It is now a ‘notifiable’ disease, meaning healthcare professionals are obliged to inform their local council or local Health Protection Team. Laboratories must also notify the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) if the monkeypox virus is identified in a laboratory sample. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: ‘Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox.  ‘This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. ‘It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.’ A rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection - generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off.

Monkeypox to get new name to stop racism and stigma,Harrison Jones,2022-06-15 15:51:00,"Monkeypox is set to be called something new – but it is unclear exactly what. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed it is working on a different name for the virus amid concerns that the current terminology is discriminatory. It comes with the UN agency also set to discuss whether to give the virus its highest health warning classification as concerns continue to mount. The WHO said yesterday that it would hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The disease had for decades generally been confined to west and central Africa, until well over 1,000 cases were detected in dozens of countries outside the region. WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus branded the outbreak ‘unusual and concerning’ as he announced the convening of the emergency committee on Thursday, June 23. If classified as a PHEIC, it would make it only the third illness currently in the category worldwide, after Covid-19 and polio. Dr Tedros added that the ‘WHO is also working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus… and the disease it causes. ‘We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.’ The move comes after more than 30 scientists called for a new name last week. They wrote that there was an ‘urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising nomenclature for monkeypox’. The group added: ‘In the context of the current global outbreak, continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising.’ As of yesterday, there had been 1,600 confirmed and 1,500 suspected cases of monkeypox in 39 countries this year, with 72 deaths, according to the WHO. While monkeypox was first discovered in macaques, many cases are believed to be transmitted to humans by rodents. The normal initial symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a blistery chickenpox-like rash. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that current cases do not always present flu-like symptoms, and rashes are sometimes limited to certain areas. The committee meeting next week will include global experts, but the WHO director general will make the final decision on whether the outbreak deserves the PHEIC label. Giving it one would help accelerate research and funding. Experts have been pushing the organisation for faster action for several weeks, following criticism of the agency’s initial response to the coronavirus pandemic. To fight the spread, the WHO is recommending ‘tried-and-tested public health tools including surveillance, contact-tracing and isolation of infected patients’. The virus spreads through close contact and in the UK many cases have been detected in men who have sex with other men. It is thought to be fatal in around 3-6% of cases, according to the WHO, although no deaths have yet been reported outside Africa in this outbreak. Dr Tedros said that it was time to consider stepping up the response because the virus is behaving unusually, more countries are affected, and there is a need for international co-ordination.

Number of people with monkeypox in the UK jumps above 300,Joe Roberts,2022-06-06 14:17:00,"Another 77 cases of monkeypox have been detected in the UK. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 302, health officials said. Experts insist the risk ‘remains low’ to the general population because it does not spread easily. Today’s dramatic rise will also be down to the Government not releasing updates on monkeypox cases over the long bank holiday weekend. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, and can live on surfaces such as bedsheets or towels. Unusual rashes or an ulceration could be a sign of infection. Many of the cases so far are linked to ‘large events or parties’, with many more of these planned in the summer months. People who have multiple sexual partners are particularly at risk.

WHO warns it may not be possible to contain the spread of monkeypox,Jen Mills,2022-06-01 15:09:00,"The World Health Organisation has warned that it it is not yet known whether it will be possible to contain the spread of monkeypox.  Another 11 cases were confirmed in England today, bringing the UK total to 190 since May 7.  And this summer is expected to see still more cases, with health officials warning that transmission in Europe could be ‘amplified’ by big events like festivals.  The European office of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that Europe is at the ‘epicentre’ of the ‘largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported’ outside of western and central Africa. Many of the cases in this outbreak have been linked to ‘large events or parties’, with many more of these planned in the coming months, with those with multiple sexual partners particularly at risk.  WHO Europe regional director Dr Hans Henri Kluge said the recent surge has coincided with the lifting of coronavirus pandemic restrictions on international travel and events. He warned that the potential for further monkeypox cases in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is ‘high’. As monkeypox cases rise sharply in the European Region, governments, civil society and health partners – must come together to stop transmission. Our Regional Director   explains what’s needed – and why community involvement is so important. In a statement, he said: ”Even as new patients present every day, investigations into past cases show that the outbreak in our region was certainly under way as early as mid-April.’ ‘Based on the case reports to date, this outbreak is currently being transmitted through social networks connected largely through sexual activity, primarily involving men who have sex with men. ‘Many – but not all cases – report fleeting and/or multiple sexual partners, sometimes associated with large events or parties. ‘Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the region. ‘Over the coming months, many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur. ‘But they also provide powerful opportunities to engage with young, sexually active and globally mobile persons to raise awareness and strengthen individual and community protection.’ He said that responding to the outbreak will not require the same measures needed for the Covid-19 pandemic but he warned that it is not yet known whether it will be possible to contain the spread of the virus completely.

European health authorities have called for the animals in contact with infected patients to be isolated in government laboratories as they’re at high risk for infection. This week, several more cases of  Since rodents are more suitable carriers of monkeypox than humans, the likelihood of them catching it from their owners is high. Monkeypox patients are being asked to avoid contact with mammal pets for 21 days or until they’re free from the virus. The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has warned that pets could become a reservoir of monkeypox which could lead to the disease becoming endemic in Europe and the UK. In  , the ECDC urged people infected with monkeypox and their close contacts to avoid their pets. Public health authorities were advised to work with veterinary authorities to ensure systems for quarantining and testing of mammalian pet animals that have been exposed or are at risk of exposure to the virus. To date there have been no reports of monkeypox infections in animals — either domestic or wild — in the EU. Pet rodents such as hamsters and guinea pigs, exposed to the virus, were advised to be ‘isolated in monitored facilities’ like laboratories, government facilities, kennels or animal welfare organisations.  The animals are to be tested by PCR for exposure to monkeypox before their quarantine can end.  ‘Euthanasia should only be a last resort reserved to situations where testing and/or isolation are not feasible,’ said the ECDC. Other mammal species like dogs can be isolated at home if there is availability of an enclosed outdoor space, regular veterinary checks, no access to visitors and pets don’t leave their homes. In 2003, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 81 human monkeypox cases after close contact with pet mammals, predominantly rodents.  The cases were connected to small mammals imported from Ghana to Texas as the probable source of introduction of the virus into the US. The spread of the virus between states was connected to infected pet prairie dogs that were housed with the rodents of African origin.

NHS 111 ‘overloaded because everyone with a rash thinks they have monkeypox’,Sabrina Johnson,2022-05-28 11:25:00,"The NHS is being swamped by calls from people with a rash who are concerned they may have monkeypox, a health official has said. Since cases of the disease were first reported in the UK earlier this month, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has advised people who may have symptoms such as a new rash to either phone NHS 111 or contact their nearest sexual health clinic.  But Mateo Prochazka, head of the UKHSA team investigating the outbreak, is urging people to use local sexual health services rather than 111 to take the pressure of the helpline which also handles other health queries. ‘Sexual health clinics are not just for gay and bisexual men,’ Mateo said during a webinar hosted by Prepster, a volunteer group of London-based HIV prevention activists helping raise awareness of monkeypox. ‘Anyone can be seen in a sexual health clinic, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or identity.

The ‘majority of cases’ identified in the UK so far have been among men who are gay, bisexual or who have sex with men. While the risk of catching the virus is not limited to this group, anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious is at risk, men who have sex with other men are being urged to be particularly aware of symptoms. Monkeypox symptoms often start with a fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes and exhaustion. The incubation period of the virus is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days.

A smallpox vaccine is being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness. The UKHSA is also advising infected people to avoid contact with their pets for 21 days, particularly rodents such as gerbils and hamsters which are susceptible to the disease. UKHSA guidance recommends pet rodents should be removed from the household of a monkeypox patient for that time period and tested for the virus, due to concerns over animal-to-animal or rodent-to-human transmission.

Monkeypox tracker ‘being planned’ after virus reaches all corners of the UK,Harrison Jones,2022-05-26 22:41:00,"Plans are being drawn up to create a Covid-like dashboard to track cases of monkeypox, it has been claimed. It comes as eight more cases were confirmed in the UK – including the first in Wales and Northern Ireland. That takes the UK total to 90 and means every country in the UK has now identified patients with the illness. But according to  , the daily updates could soon be out tracked in a similar way to Covid-19. The coronavirus dashboard was developed over a number of weeks after the crisis began in Spring 2020. But with the technology now in place, the paper says imitating the dashboard for monkeypox would be a ‘relatively simple task’ – but adds there is no known date for the move, which also depends on the outbreak continuing. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the new cases bring the English total since May 7 to 85, and the UK total to 90. Health officials in Wales confirmed their first case on Thursday morning, before the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland later confirmed a case. Two further cases were confirmed in Scotland, Public Health Scotland said, bringing the number of cases north of the border to three. People with unusual rashes or lesions, particularly if they have had a new sexual partner, have been urged to limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health clinic. Dr Susan Hopkins, UKHSA chief medical adviser, said: ‘We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms.’ Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, added: ‘We are working with the UK Health Security Agency, Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. ‘The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. ‘Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks’ One expert has suggested that the outbreak may have been sparked by  . In Scotland, the two latest cases are said to be in people with ‘recent travel history’ and they are being treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance, according to Public Health Scotland. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer suggested today that the outbreak – and cases of hepatitis seen around the world in children – could be linked to lower immunity levels as a result of lockdowns. Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population ‘remains low’. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness.

If people – particularly people who have recently had a new sexual partner – show signs of these symptoms, they are urged to limit their contact with others and consult a doctor or a sexual health clinic. Can something help prevent either the spread of the infection or limit the symptoms, though? Can a vaccine help? The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed that vaccines used during the smallpox eradication programme also provided protection against monkeypox. Because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, the smallpox vaccine can protect people from getting monkeypox – past data from Africa suggests that the smallpox vaccine is at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. The   as  WHO also explain that, though the two bear close clinical similarities, monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox and causes less severe illness.

						 Monkeypox is caused by monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae – smallpox is a related orthopoxvirus infection. Monkeypox is transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus. The CDC (Center for Disease Control) in the United States argues that the sooner a person receives the vaccine, the more effective it will be in protecting against monkeypox virus. However, if you think you’ve been exposed to the virus already, you can still consider getting vaccinated afterwards. The CDC recommends that the vaccine be given within 4 days from the date of exposure in order to prevent onset of the disease. If that isn’t possible, if a vaccine is given between 4–14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease but may not prevent the disease.

Parents told not to worry about monkeypox as cases in children are rare,Harrison Jones,2022-05-24 23:30:00,"Experts have urged parents not to worry about monkeypox, since cases in youngsters are so rare. Medics also suggest rashes in children are more likely to be a result of chickenpox or hand, foot and mouth disease. The calming intervention comes as the  earlier today. One researchers who has been looking into the current outbreak and past cases explained: ‘As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don’t think parents should be worried about this being… monkeypox at this stage, because we’re seeing a very low number of cases.’ Dr David Porter, a paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, continued: ‘And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we’ve seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it’s been predominantly in adults anyway. ‘And without any contact history with somebody that’s known or strongly felt to have monkeypox, and then if you’ve got a rash at this time of year when we’ve seen lots of rashes from chickenpox and other things in children, hand, foot and mouth disease, then that’s what it’s likely to be.’ He added that parents whose children who develop a rash but have no contact history with someone who tested positive for monkeypox should be reassured that they are unlikely to have the virus – and follow what they would normally do. Dr Porter’s comments came as the results of a small study that looked at seven cases of monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021 were revealed. The findings, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggest that transmission within the UK has occurred in household and healthcare settings but has been limited. The study also looked at the effectiveness of two antiviral treatments developed for smallpox, brincidofovir and tecovirimat. Researchers suggested that the latter might shorten the duration of monkeypox symptoms and cut the period that a patient is contagious for. They explained that the drug would be given on a case-by-case basis, and in their study it was given to a mum who needed to be out of hospital quickly to come home to her daughter. Author Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: ‘While the study size was small, the data gleaned from the seven cases were rich, providing the team with novel insights and suggesting the direction of travel for future research. ‘We hope this dataset will inform clinicians caring for patients with monkeypox across the UK and Europe, but also in West and Central Africa where there is an unmet need for treatments for this infection.’ One expert suggested this week that the  And data suggests transmission is occurring between people in the UK, with a large proportion of cases identified in gay and bisexual male community. However, researchers say there is no clear argument for vaccinating this population. A rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection - generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off. Between one and 21 days after infection, you may experience the following symptoms: All in all, symptoms can last around two to four weeks. You can  . Dr Jake Dunning, consultant in infectious diseases and High consequence infectious diseases (HCID), Royal Free Hospital, said: ‘We don’t have enough of the signal yet to say that is the correct thing to do, to offer vaccinations to all men who have sex with men. ‘This is on the basis that currently they make up a large proportion of the cases that we’re seeing and the challenge is you need data to inform that sort of decision.’ The most likely route of monkeypox transmission is close physical contact, touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, or touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs. There is a smaller risk of it being spread through coughs and sneezes, and as prolonged face-to-face contact would be needed, this is not one of the main routes of transmission for the monkeypox virus.

Why is it called monkeypox? Name of virus outbreak explained,Elizabeth Atkin,2022-05-25 16:54:00,"After two long years of Covid-19,   is the latest viral disease to hit headlines. A type of Pox virus, monkeypox is in the same family as smallpox – though its bumpy rash, fever, chills and other symptoms are sometimes confused for the highly contagious (yet unrelated) chickenpox.  at the time of writing – with officials springing into action to isolate the individuals’ close contacts. But one stone does indeed remain unturned… why is it called monkeypox? And is it connected to actual monkeys? Here’s what you should know. Monkeypox’s name does indeed have something to do with monkeys. The   (CDC) has noted that monkeypox was first discovered in 1958, when there were two outbreaks among a group of monkeys. These monkeys were being kept specifically for animal research purposes. Humans did not contract monkeypox until 1970, when the first recorded case appeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, it’s important to note that monkeys aren’t necessarily the cause of all monkeypox outbreaks – as the   writes that it is often thought to be caused by rodents. Its website states: ‘Monkeypox can be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa. It’s thought to be spread by rodents, such as rats, mice and squirrels. ‘You can catch monkeypox from an infected animal if you’re bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs. ‘It may also be possible to catch monkeypox by eating meat from an infected animal that has not been cooked thoroughly, or by touching other products from infected animals (such as animal skin or fur).’ This is pretty clear-cut compared to , as its the reason for its animal-themed moniker is currently unknown – though there are several theories.

Number of people with monkeypox in UK jumps to 71,Sean Seddon,2022-05-24 15:43:00,"Another 14 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK, taking the total to 71. A rare outbreak of the smallpox-like disease is continuing to spread, alarming health officials around the world. All but one of the cases are in England, with the other previously confirmed to be in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland have seen none so far. The updated figures were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which has continued to stress the risk to the UK population remains low despite the ‘significant and concerning’ spate of infections.  Stocks of the smallpox vaccine are being bought by the government and offered to close contacts of confirmed infections. Those at the highest risk of contracting the disease are being asked to self-isolate at home for 21 days, with others warned to be on the lookout for symptoms. Transmission between people is occurring in the UK, with a large proportion of cases identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Leading global health experts are exploring the possibility that raves in Europe are fuelling the outbreak. Professor David Heymann, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) former assistant director-general for health security and environment, is reported to have said it is a leading theory among many under consideration.  The WHO said cases had been confirmed in a dozen countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and several more in Europe. There have been 131 confirmed infections and 106 further suspected cases since May 7. Slovenia and the United Arab Emirates are the latest counties to confirm their first infection, Denmark announced its first case yesterday, while Portugal and Italy both revised their counts up. The virus can spread through close physical contact, touching materials and infected person has used on their body (such as clothing) or via coughs and sneezes. It is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

Woman could lose both her legs after gnat bite 13 years ago,Harrison Jones,2022-05-24 19:38:00,"An Essex mum-of-two has been told she could lose both of her legs thanks to a tiny insect bite more than decade ago. Jorja Austin, 40, developed a rare skin condition after being bitten by a gnat on her right leg while mowing the lawn in 2009. Now a life-threatening bout of sepsis has led to warning from doctors that her two lower limbs may have to be amputated – though she remains hopeful of avoiding that fate. She spent three weeks in hospital after being rushed in with sepsis and fell into a coma. Jorja’s original bite had never healed following the incident 13 years ago in Basildon – even though it was just ‘pinhole’ size. Two years later, the former admin assistant was diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare skin condition that causes excruciating ulcers. Horrifying pictures show the extent of Jorja’s injuries and the pain she endures. She explained: ‘I’ve been in agony for 13 years. At one point I could see my leg tendons. ‘There’s a risk that my legs will have to be amputated. ‘But the doctors have said that the sepsis may heal so I might be able to get plastic surgery instead. ‘I’m just hoping the wounds will get better. Fingers crossed it will all turn around.’ Doctors at Basildon Hospital are now keeping dressings on her lower legs, which are almost red raw from painful ulcers. Looking back on the original bite, she recalled: ‘I was in the garden cutting the grass and I literally had four tiny bites on my leg, just like pinholes. ‘One bite never healed up. When I went to the doctors they said it was fine but it just got bigger and bigger. ‘I was just one of those unlucky people.’ Her two children, aged 12 and 16, were put into social care as their mother’s health began to fail – with authorities ruling that her health meant she could not care for them. But sister Paige Austin said: ‘She (Jorja) is the strongest person we know and has been the rock in our family. ‘She’s still going strong but no one should be like this at the age of 40.’

"Response to monkeypox in UK ‘is worthy of praise’, says expert",Metro News Reporter,2022-05-24 11:27:00,"The UK’s response to monkeypox should be praised, an expert in infectious diseases has said, as he noted that superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, said ‘we have never seen anything like this before, with such a number of cases’ in so many countries. The  , the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said yesterday, after  of the virus. Cases of monkeypox have been reported in 14 countries, according to epidemiologists at Harvard University who are tracking the spread, including 40 cases in Spain and 23 in Portugal. Health officials now   in Spain and Belgium. Sir Jeremy told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that there have been small outbreaks in the past, with cases recorded in the UK, but ‘this is different, something has changed’. Monkeypox is usually found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere. He added: ‘The virus may have changed, but I think that’s unlikely. More likely is, I think, that the niche that this virus now finds itself in has allowed for some superspreader events and those individuals involved in that have then travelled to other parts of the world and taken the infection with them.’ He said the fact that the virus has ‘spread across borders so quickly is different’ from what has been seen before. At a superspreading event, the number of cases transmitted will be disproportionately high compared with general transmission. Sir Jeremy said he thinks the UKHSA ‘deserves great credit’ for its ‘textbook example’ response to the outbreak. ‘The action is what’s happening in the UK at the moment, which is very detailed, very painstaking contact tracing, identifying people who come forward and identifying their contacts and tracking everybody to see that you can break those chains of transmission, and making sure that that’s done in a trusted way… ‘The worst thing is if we have any stigma associated with these infections, and people are fearful or don’t want to come forward, and that’s when epidemics can really take off.’ Transmission between people is occurring in the UK, with a large proportion of cases identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, and through the coughs and sneezes of somebody with the infection. Meanwhile, prime minister Boris Johnson said monkeypox was a rare disease but it was important to ‘keep an eye on it’. He told reporters on a visit to a school in south-east London: ‘It’s basically very rare disease, and so far the consequences don’t seem to be very serious but it’s important that we keep an eye on it and that’s exactly what the the new UK Health Security Agency is doing. ‘ A rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection - generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off.

Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or the use of the smallpox vaccine, Mr Johnson said: ‘As things stand the judgment is that it’s rare. ‘I think we’re looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. ‘It hasn’t yet proved, fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.’ The government has stocks of the smallpox vaccine, which is being offered to very close contacts of those who have been affected.

Monkeypox: Joe Biden says virus outbreak is not as concerning as Covid,Isabel Keane,2022-05-23 18:44:00,"President   on Monday said that an outbreak of monkeypox is not as risky as the coronavirus pandemic, countering comments he made a day before that ‘everyone should be concerned’ about the outbreak.  While on a visit in Tokyo, the president said the smallpox vaccine is effective on monkeypox and that the US has enough to counter the growing outbreak, should it worsen.  ‘We have had this monkeypox in large numbers in the past. We have vaccines to take care of it,’ he said.  ‘I just don’t think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with Covid-19,’ he added.  Despite feeling that the monkeypox isn’t as large of a threat as the coronavirus, he still warned Americans to be careful.  On Monday, health officials said they may have found a third case of the virus in the US in a patient in South Florida.  The first monkeypox case in the US was reported in Massachusetts on Wednesday. The second was found in New York City on Friday.  Monkeypox, which is similar to smallpox but more mild, spreads through close person-to-person contact.

Monkeypox outbreak ‘was likely sparked by sex at two raves in Spain and Belgium’,Sam Courtney-Guy,2022-05-23 22:42:00,"The growing global outbreak of monkeypox cases is sexual transmission can probably be traced to sexual activity at two raves in Europe, a top expert has said. Dr David Heymann, a senior adviser to the World Health Organisation, said the outbreak is best described as ‘random event’.  Health officials have not ruled out other explanations but the leading theory to explain the outbreak is sexual transmission at two erotic parties in Spain and Beglium, he added. Dr Heymann said: ‘We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission.’ There are now around 200 confirmed and suspected cases across a dozen countries, with 57 in the UK. According to the WHO, the cases are mainly spreading through sexual contact between men. Monkeypox cases have rarely occurred outside central and western Africa, where it is endemic in animals, and have never amounted to a full-scale outbreak. The chief of the WHO’s smallpox research team said: ‘We’ve seen a few cases in Europe over the last five years, just in travelers, but this is the first time we’re seeing cases across many countries at the same time in people who have not traveled to the endemic regions in Africa.’ The United Nations’ Aids agency has warned that racist and homophobic fearmongering could undermine efforts to combat the virus. UNAIDS stressed that all kinds of close physical contact can cause transmission, so the virus can affect anyone. This includes contact with a sick person as well as their belongings, such as clothing or bedsheets. The agency’s deputy executive director Matthew Kavanagh said: ‘Stigma and blame undermine trust and capacity to respond effectively during outbreaks like this one. ‘Experience shows that stigmatising rhetoric can quickly disable evidence-based response by stoking cycles of fear, driving people away from health services, impeding efforts to identify cases and encouraging ineffective, punitive measures.’ Mike Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London. added: ‘By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, whatever a person’s sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission.’ Health officials say there is a ‘high likelihood’ that the virus will continue to spread through ‘close contact’. Cases so far have been mild, with no deaths reported, and smallpox vaccines are known to be effective against the disease. Symptoms usually include fever, chills, rash and lesions on the face or genitals. Most patients recover in a few weeks without requiring hospital treatment, and new antiviral drugs targeting monkeypox are in develoment. Around 6% of all cases in recent years have been fatal. .

EU advises countries to plan vaccines for monkeypox outbreak,Jen Mills,2022-05-23 15:59:00,"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has told states to prepare strategies to counter the spread of monkeypox, including vaccination.  In a report published today, the EU organisation said: ‘Countries should update their contact tracing mechanisms, their diagnostic capacity for orthopoxviruses and review the availability of smallpox vaccines, antivirals and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health professionals.’ It advises that government should review the types, doses and authorisation status of vaccines in case they need to be deployed.  The report does not recommend mass vaccination programmes of people not at particular risk, but says that those exposed could be given the jab. It says that healthcare workers who may be exposed to the virus could also be vaccinated as a precaution.  The report says that people infected ‘should remain isolated until their rash heals completely, avoiding contact with immunosuppressed persons and pets’. They said that most people should be able to stay isolating at home ‘with supportive care’. Cases of monkeypox have been found in nine EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The disease has also been found in the UK, as well as in Canada, the US (Boston and New York), Australia, Israel and Switzerland. ! Rapid Risk Assesment –   multi-country outbreak.

If the current outbreaks continue to grow, states are likely to have to start rolling out jabs to try and get on top of the spread.  For example, close contacts of those infected could be given the vaccine to give them protection. The UK has already  that close contacts of those with monkeypox could be given a Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) vaccine. This would be the Imvanex vaccine against smallpox, which contains a live modified form of the vaccinia virus called ‘vaccinia Ankara’, which is related to the smallpox virus. People used to be routinely given a smallpox vaccine, but have not been since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980.  The latest moves are a sign of how seriously health authorities are taking this virus, which is usually not a major concern in Europe.  Today, the government said there have now been 56 confirmed cases in England, up from 20 at the last count, with  Since the first case was reported on May 7, from a person who travelled from Nigeria, there have since been dozens more case in the UK, mostly without a connection to this patient or to travel abroad. Between May 18 and 22, nine EU states reported additional suspected or confirmed cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages – it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off.

Number of monkeypox cases in England jumps to 56,Zaina Alibhai,2022-05-23 16:53:00,"The total number of monkeypox in England has more than doubled to 56, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said. That is a jump of 36 in the number of patients confirmed to have the illness since May 7, with the UK-wide figure yet to be release. The UKHSA conceded that the outbreak is ‘significant and concerning’ but said the risk to the UK population remains low. Earlier on Monday,   but no cases have yet been identified in Northern Ireland or Wales. The disease is usually found in parts of central and west Africa and is rarely seen outside the region. But cases have now been recorded in the UK, US, Canada, Spain and Italy in recent weeks.

Ministers have insisted the   is not a ‘repeat’ of Covid and a vaccine that works against the disease is already available. ‘As with any new disease, and obviously after the Covid pandemic doubly so, we continue to monitor this very closely,’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News. ‘I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. He added: ‘There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact. ‘What I would say is that we are cautious but we are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.’ Mr Clarke’s comments follows advice issued by the UKHSA, warning anyone who comes in contact with an  . People who have developed a rash and are changing sexual partners frequently are also urged to come forward and seek diagnosis. The UKHSA’s chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, said: ‘Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK. ‘Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact tracing efforts – you are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK. ‘Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions, and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms. ‘A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.’ She had previously explained: ‘We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in the country. ‘The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas.’ While there is no direct vaccine for monkeypox, those with the infection are being treated using a form of the smallpox vaccine. The symptoms of monkeypox include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backaches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can likely develop on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including to the genitals, going through different stages, starting with blotches like chickenpox and then scabbing over and falling off. The infection can be transmitted through close contact with someone, or through clothing and linens used by a person who has monkeypox. There are thousands of monkeypox infections across Africa every year, according to World Health Organisation estimates. .

Anyone in contact with monkeypox must isolate for three weeks,Kirsten Robertson,2022-05-23 06:45:00,"People who come into contact with monkeypox cases should isolate for three weeks and avoid children, health experts have advised. There are currently 20 confirmed cases in the UK. New guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged those who have had ‘unprotected direct contact or high-risk environmental contact’ to self-isolate. This would include no travel, providing details for contact tracing and avoiding direct contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women and children under 12. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, this weekend warned monkeypox is spreading through community transmission. Speaking to BBC One’s Sunday Morning, she said: ‘We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department.’ Those who are considered at high risk of having caught monkeypox may have had household contact, sexual contact, or have changed an infected person’s bedding without wearing appropriate PPE. The UK should expect to see more cases on a ‘daily basis’, Dr Hopkins added. Monkeypox is rarely seen outside Africa but  Austria, Israel and Switzerland became the latest countries to record their first cases over the weekend. The disease, first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact,  Globally, the number of confirmed and suspected cases has reached 145 across 13 countries. A mandatory quarantine  where the isolation period is also 21 days. The UKHSA has advised that people at high risk of having caught monkeypox should be offered a smallpox vaccine. Dr Hopkins said: ‘We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country. ‘The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.’ Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: ‘That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have. ‘We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash.’ Monkeypox â what you need to know ð There is concern that a sizable number of the confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK have been in gay and bi men. However, anyone with monkeypox can pass it on, regardless of sexual orientation.

How do you catch monkeypox and is it deadly?,Ewan Quayle,2022-05-22 15:34:00,"Health authorities around the world are investigating a recent outbreak of monkeypox, a rare viral disease typically confined to Africa. The  , with     hospital Cases of the rare infection, which gets its name from a smallpox-style disease found in a monkey colony in 1958, have been discovered in over a dozen countries so far. But how do you catch monkeypox  – and how worried should you be about it? Here is everything you need to know. So far, only a small number of people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK and it is not easily passed from human to human. Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ‘While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person.’ According to the  , monkeypox can be spread through: Current advice in the UK is that people are highly unlikely to catch monkeypox if they have not recently travelled to the region and have not been in close contact with someone who has the disease. Anyone who has multiple sexual partners, or who has ‘close contact with individuals that they don’t know’, has been  . Anyone who develops   are encouraged to contact their GP as soon as possible. While the disease may resemble smallpox when it comes to symptoms, the disease is far less deadly. Monkeypox is less dangerous than smallpox, but more so than chickenpox. Smallpox kills one-third of its victims, while chickenpox kills just 0.009% – or just one in 100,000 cases. According to the  monkeypox has a mortality rate of  .

Most of the severe cases are found in children and adults with compromised immune systems. The vast majority of people will make a full recovery in a matter of weeks without needing hosptialisation. A rash will usually appear between one to five days after infection - generally beginning on the face before spreading. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs that later fall off.

British tourist tested for monkeypox on Canary Islands,Joe Roberts,2022-05-24 08:11:00,"A British tourist is being tested for monkeypox after arriving in the Canary Islands. Spanish health chiefs in Fuerteventura confirmed the man is one of five suspected new cases. His name and age are currently unknown, but he is thought to be the first British tourist to be tested for the virus abroad. ‘A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist,’ the Canary Islands’ Health Service said. Officials have not yet confirmed if has the virus, or whether he was holidaying alone on the island. It comes as the number of monkeypox cases in England more than doubled yesterday to 56. UK health bosses say the outbreak is ‘significant and concerning’ but stressed the risk to the wider population remains low. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and said another 67 people are being tested.

People having sex with multiple partners need to look out for monkeypox,Jen Mills,2022-05-22 13:43:00,"Anyone who has multiple sexual partners, or who has ‘close contact with individuals that they don’t know’, has been urged to be vigilant about monkeypox. The virus, which causes sores and can lead to serious illness, is spreading in the UK with more cases expected to be confirmed after the weekend.  A senior doctor has said that anyone developing a rash after being in contact with another should get themselves checked out. The illness is not exclusively spread via sexual contact, but as it can be transmitted through touching someone who has the sores, this has so far been a key way of it being transmitted.  It may also be spread via respiratory droplets, for example if a person is face to face with someone infected, or from touching a towel or bedsheets used by someone infected.  Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ‘We would recommend to anyone who’s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash.’ She said the disease is now spreading from person to person within the UK, and not only found in those who had travelled abroad.  So far, there have been 20 confirmed cases in the UK with nine other countries outside of Central and West Africa also reporting outbreaks. Belgium became the  , to try and stop the spread.  The disease was first found in monkeys and is related to the virus which causes smallpox, however it is usually milder.  Dr Hopkins said cases have so far predominantly been identified in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual or men who have sex with other men. Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: ‘That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have.’ Speaking to BBC One’s Morning Show, Dr Hopkins said: ‘We will be releasing updated numbers tomorrow – over-the-weekend figures. The disease can spread between people through: The incubation period (the time between contact with an infected person and the time that you first get symptoms) is between 5 and 21 days. Most people recover within several weeks even without any treatment, but severe illness can occur in some individuals. The illness begins with: Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off. An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. Source:  ‘We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department.’ Asked if people will need to get vaccinated for the infection, she said: ‘There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox but we are using a form of smallpox vaccine – a third-generation, smallpox vaccine that’s safe in individuals who are contacts of cases. ‘So, we’re not using it in the general population. ‘We’re using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ‘For contacts, (this) reduces your risk of developing disease, so that’s how we’re focusing our vaccination efforts at this point.’ It comes as US president Joe Biden said that recent cases of monkeypox which have been identified in Europe and the United States are something ‘to be concerned about’. In his first public comments on the disease, Mr Biden added: ‘It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential.’ . Not convinced?

Belgium’s Risk Assessment Group (RAG) and health authorities said those infected will need to isolate for 21 days.  They said anyone with symptoms should seek medical advice.  There has been an outbreak in the country linked to a gay fetish festival called Darklands, where three attendees tested positive. Organisers said: ‘There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries.’ They circulated warning information from the government saying that those infected would have to self isolate for three weeks and avoid any physical sexual contact.  Over the last week, concerns have grown about the spread of monkeypox, a viral disease which is usually rare and found mainly in those who recently travelled to Africa.

Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for UKHSA, said updated figures for the weekend will be released on Monday as she warned of more cases ‘on a daily basis’.

Number of monkeypox cases ‘could rise significantly in next two or three weeks’,Sabrina Johnson,2022-05-21 21:29:00,"The UK is likely to see a ‘significant rise’ in monkeypox cases over the new few weeks, an expert has warned. More than 100 confirmed or suspected cases of the virus have been reported in countries outside of Central and West Africa,  . Cases have been reported in the US, and several European countries including Switzerland which confirmed its first case of the virus on Saturday after an infected person became unwell, authorities said. Elsewhere in Europe cases have been confirmed in the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Italy and Spain, where a number of cases have been linked to a sauna in Madrid. ‘Several patients’ in the Netherlands are understood to have contracted monkeypox a day after the country confirmed its first case. While in Germany, at least two cases of monkeypox have been reported in Berlin after the country’s first case was reported in Munich on Friday. The majority of cases in European cases have been reported in young men who have not travelled to Europe. While in the US, it has been confirmed a patient in New York City had contracted monkeypox, after the state of Massachusetts confirmed its first case earlier this week. Monkeypox, which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact, including sex. There are concerns   on sexual health services. Some UK health clinics are now stopping people walking in as they try to slow the spread of infections. Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said she expected to see a rise in cases over the coming days. ‘Our response is really critical here,’ she told  ‘There is going to be more diagnoses over the next week. How many is hard to say. ‘What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. ‘It’s already circulating in the general population. Getting on top of all those people’s contacts is a massive job. ‘It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks.’ Dr Dewsnap said she expected more monkeypox cases to be identified around the UK. ‘I’m definitely expecting a significant rise over this next week,’ she added. Dr Dewsnap said she is concerned about how the infection could affect services because staff who come in contact with sufferers are forced to isolate. Shesaid clinic staff were ‘already under significant pressure’ before monkeypox was identified, making the situation worse. ‘It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who’s infected,’ Dr Dewsnap said. ‘In terms of the infection and its consequences for individuals, I’m not that concerned,’ she later told BBC Radio 4. ‘But I am concerned about our ability to maintain good sexual health services and access for everyone while still managing this new infection.’ Dr Dewsnap said some health clinic staff had received the smallpox vaccine, which can be effective against monkeypox, and talks are taking place about giving doses to ‘potential risk groups’. Meanwhile, Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University, described the current monkeypox outbreak as ‘an unusual situation’, because the virus is being transmitted within communities outside of Central and West Africa. ‘It’s transmitted by close person-to-person contact and, in the past, we have not seen it being very infectious,’ Sir Peter said. ‘What’s unusual about what we’re seeing now is that we’re seeing transmission occurring in the community in Europe and now in other countries, so it’s an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now have ongoing transmission within certain communities.’ He added: ‘It would appear that there is some element of sexual transmission perhaps with just the very close contact between people and the skin lesions because a large proportion of the current cases are being detected in gay and bisexual men. ‘So it’s very important that we get the message across that if people have unusual skin lesions that they do seek attention quickly so that we can control this. ‘The important thing is that we interrupt transmission and this doesn’t become established in the human population in Europe.’ .

						 ‘So we need adequate funding so we can adequately staff with the experts that we need and the appropriately trained staff in clinics so that we can ensure people can get in quickly, and therefore we can reduce the risk of infection of other people.’ Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of Oxford University’s Pandemic Sciences Institute, described the current monkeypox outbreak as ‘unusual’ because the virus is being transmitted within communities outside of Central and West Africa. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘It’s transmitted by close person-to-person contact and, in the past, we have not seen it being very infectious. ‘What’s unusual about what we’re seeing now is that we’re seeing transmission occurring in the community in Europe and now in other countries. ‘So it’s an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now have ongoing transmission within certain communities.’ He added: ‘It’s very important that we get the message across that if people have unusual skin lesions that they do seek attention quickly so that we can control this. ‘The important thing is that we interrupt transmission and this doesn’t become established in the human population in Europe.’ .

Monkeypox outbreak linked to super-spreader event at adult sauna,Sam Corbishley,2022-05-21 09:02:00,"An outbreak of monkeypox in Spain has been linked to a super-spreader event at a sauna in Madrid. Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the region’s health chief, told reporters on Friday that most of the country’s 30 cases have been traced back to a single venue in the capital. The UK confirmed 11 new cases of monkeypox on Friday, more than doubling the total to 20. Globally, 127 cases have been reported in 11 countries, according to John Brownstein, professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School in the US, who is keeping track of cases. The UK Health Security Agency has said a notable proportion of recent cases here and in Europe have been found in men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men Portugal detected a further nine cases on Friday, taking its total to 23. The previous 14 were all found in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. In Belgium, three cases have also been linked to a fetish festival in Antwerp, The Telegraph reports. The Darklands Festival, which describes itself as a place where ‘various tribes in the gay fetish community (leather, rubber, army, skinhead, puppies…) come together to create a unique spectacle of fetish brotherhood’, posted a message on its website reading: ‘There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries.’ Monkeypox cases are usually found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere. That is why outbreaks reported across Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States have caused alarm among public health experts. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. It can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off. The incubation period of monkeypox is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days. ð¢ Read the latest on cases of   identified in England:    The cases in the UK are not all one cluster, with separate cases springing up that are unconnected. The first identified patient was a person who had returned from Nigeria but other cases are unrelated to travel, suggesting there is community transmission. A link was first drawn between gay men and monkeypox earlier in the week, with the UKHSA urging men who have sex with men to be alert to any new rashes or lesions on their body. Jimmy Whitworth, Professor of International Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the outbreak in the UK was ‘unprecedented’. He said: ‘There is a need to engage with the at-risk community of gay and bisexual men to ensure they know about the presence of this infection and report any sign and symptoms to health facilities. ‘Cases need to be identified, isolated and treated, either in hospital or at home, depending on severity and circumstances. ‘Close contacts need to be identified and monitored for signs of infection. Monkeypox is not very transmissible and with these measures the outbreak can be quickly brought under control.’ Monkeypox â what you need to know ð There is concern that a sizable number of the confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK have been in gay and bi men. However, anyone with monkeypox can pass it on, regardless of sexual orientation. (1/2) Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University, said the spread of the virus outside of Central and West Africa was ‘an unusual situation’. Sir Peter told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s transmitted by close person-to-person contact and, in the past, we have not seen it being very infectious. ‘What’s unusual about what we’re seeing now is that we’re seeing transmission occurring in the community in Europe and now in other countries, so it’s an unusual situation where we seem to have had the virus introduced but now have ongoing transmission within certain communities.’ Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, and through the coughs and sneezes of somebody with the infection. The UKHSA said monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population remains low. Sir Peter said: ‘It would appear that there is some element of sexual transmission perhaps with just the very close contact between people and the skin lesions, because a large proportion of the current cases are being detected in gay and bisexual men. ‘So, it’s very important that we get the message across that if people have unusual skin lesions that they do seek attention quickly so that we can control this. ‘The important thing is that we interrupt transmission and this doesn’t become established in the human population in Europe.’ Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) regional director for Europe, said: ‘As we enter the summer season in the European region, with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity and the symptoms are unfamiliar to many. ‘I would like to emphasise that individuals contracting monkeypox must not be stigmatised or discriminated against in any way. ‘Timely risk communication with the general public is important, and public health bodies should widely disseminate accurate and practical advice on prevention, diagnosis and treatment.’ .

Number of people with monkeypox in UK more than doubles to 20,Sam Corbishley,2022-05-20 12:24:00,"Another 11 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK – more than doubling the total to 20, the UK Health Security Agency has confirmed. The new cases come on top of the nine previously identified, with the initial case having returned from travel to Nigeria. Globally, 127 cases have been reported in 11 countries, according to John Brownstein, professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School in the US, who is keeping track of global cases. Health Secretary   said: ‘Most cases are mild, and I can confirm we have procured further doses of vaccines that are effective against monkeypox.’ The rise in cases since May 6 has caused concern among ministers that the virus may be circulating undetected.

						 Monkeypox cases are usually found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere. That is why   among public health experts around the world. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off. The incubation period is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates there are thousands of monkeypox infections in around a dozen African countries every year. Most are in Congo, which reports approximately 6,000 infections annually, and Nigeria, where there are around 3,000 per year. The latest worldwide clusters of cases appear to be the first time the virus is spreading among people who did not travel to Africa. It has confounded scientists there. Oyewale Tomori, a virologist who formerly headed the Nigerian Academy of Science and who sits on several World Health Organisation advisory boards, said: ‘I’m stunned by this. Every day I wake up and there are more countries infected. ‘This is not the kind of spread we’ve seen in West Africa, so there may be something new happening in the West.’ The UKHSA has said cases in Britain are not all connected, suggesting there are multiple chains of transmission occurring. In Europe, Germany and Belgium have both confirmed they have detected cases of the smallpox-like disease. Health officials in Spain have reported seven cases, all males, and Portugal updated its number of confirmed cases to 14. Sweden’s public health agency also reported one case on Thursday, saying it remained unclear how the patient became infected. Italy has also confirmed another two infections, taking the total in the country to three. Earlier this week, US officials reported a case of monkeypox in a man who had recently travelled to Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada also confirmed two cases related to that positive test. Health officials in Quebec earlier said they suspected 17 cases in the Montreal area. Experts have warned that while the virus may not be about to trigger a Covid-19-style pandemic, it is likely to spread further and should be taken seriously. Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the current international outbreak is ‘highly unusual’. ‘Historically, there have been very few cases exported. It has only happened eight times in the past before this year,’ he said. ‘This isn’t going to cause a nationwide epidemic like Covid did, but it’s a serious outbreak of a serious disease – and we should take it seriously.’ Recent UK cases have self-identified as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men (MSM). Authorities in Spain and Portugal also said their cases were in young MSM men and said those cases were picked up when the men turned up with lesions at sexual health clinics. The UKHSA is advising gay, bisexual and MSM men to check for any usual rashes or lesions on their bodies, particularly their genitals, and to contact a sexual health service if they are concerned. Monkeypox can be passed on by direct contact though sex, but is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection. Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, said it’s still too early to determine how the men in the UK were infected. He said: ‘By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, whatever a person’s sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission.’ Anyone who is worried is advised to contact sexual health services and to call ahead for an appointment, or to call 111. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said: ‘We anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals. ‘We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. ‘We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. ‘We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice. ‘Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns. ‘Please contact clinics ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you have been seen by a clinician. ‘A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned.’ .

"Russia ‘planned to use monkeypox as a bioweapon’, report warned",Sam Courtney-Guy,2022-05-20 16:41:00,"’s military scientists researched using monkeypox as a bio-weapon until at least the early 1990s, according to newly resurfaced interviews with a former Russian army colonel. Ken Alibek, who was deputy chief of the USSR’s biological weapons programme until its collapse in 1991 and stayed on in its Russian Federation successor until a year later, claimed he oversaw 32,000 employees over 40 facilities. After moving to the US, he revealed how the Soviets had investigated a variety of infectious diseases for use in warfare, focusing on smallpox until its eradication through global vaccine programmes forced them to ditch the idea. In a 1998 interview with staff at the American Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Project (CBWNP), he explained that smallpox was ruled out as stray cases caused by an accidental leak in Russia would now be ‘difficult to explain to the international community’. He said: ‘So we developed a special program to determine what “model” viruses could be used instead of human smallpox.  ‘We tested vaccinia virus, mousepox virus, rabbitpox virus, and monkeypox virus as models for smallpox.  ‘The idea was that all research and development work would be conducted using these model viruses. Once we obtained a set of positive results, it would take just two weeks to conduct the same manipulations with smallpox virus and to stockpile the warfare agent.  ‘We would have in our arsenal a genetically altered smallpox virus that could replace the previous one.’ Russia’s Ministry of Defence decided to continue working with monkeypox to ‘create future biological weapons’ after the end of the USSR, Dr Alibek added. In 1998 he was also brought before a United States Congress hearing, where he said was ‘he convinced that Russia’s biological weapons program has not been completely dismantled’. His claims were backed by a former United Nations weapons inspector, Jonathan Tucker, who left the UN Special Commission to work at the Monterey Institute think tank in Washington. He told United Press International in 2002 that there was still a ‘real fear’ monkeypox could be engineered as a bioweapon. Protection from the smallpox vaccine would be enough to repel infections, Mr Tucker added, but many countries have only held onto moderate stockpiles of the jab since the disease was eradicated. Another former UN weapons inspector, who did not wish to be named, was quoted in the report as saying: ‘There’s no confirmation that (monkeypox) leaked out, but the potential exists’. Interviewed again for the same report, said that while he was not aware of any leaks, ‘it was not a problem to get any of the orthopox viruses (smallpox, camelpox and monkeypox)’. At the time of the report, monkeypox was not thought to be transmissible between humans. However it is now known that the virus can spread through extended face-to-face contact. There are now 20 cases in the UK, health secretary Sajid Javid revealed on Friday, although ‘most cases’ are mild. The virus has also been detected in nine other countries outside Central and West Africa, where the majority of historic cases have been concentrated. African scientists have said they are baffled by its global spread. The UK is now stocking up on smallpox vaccines as a precaution, he added. . Not convinced?

On May 21, the Finnish state-owned company   said in a statement that gas supplies through the Imatra entry point had been stopped. ‘The amount of gas needed by the Finnish gas market is imported into the Finnish gas system through Balticconnector entry point in accordance with the nominations made by the market parties’ it said in a statement.

Health workers in the UK who have been exposed to the virus are being offered a smallpox vaccine. Ministers have ordered 20,000 more doses to add to the small stockpile of 5,000 already held by the health service. The first case in the UK was recorded in 2018 but, unlike several of the cases being identified in this outbreak, was linked with travel to an African country where monkeypox is common.

Monkeypox produces a similar to disease to smallpox but has a lower death rate, with most people making a full recovery. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off.

"ICYMI: Monkeypox, Ukraine and partygate – this week’s five top stories, explained",Sean Seddon,2022-05-21 07:00:00,"Hello and best wishes to everyone except that couple who won the lottery. It is our heavy burden to inform you that, while you weren’t looking, events stubbornly continued to unfold this week. Most of those events went unnoticed and filed themselves into the cosmic categories of ‘stuff’, ‘things’ and ‘s**t happens’. Others, however, demanded attention and were documented by high-functioning alcoholics known as ‘journalists’ and then relayed to a wider audience, rendering them ‘news’. You wouldn’t know this, of course, because you were on your phone. But that’s fine, Metro was keeping its weather eye across all things, grimly noting the most important in our tear-stained ledger, all in preparation for the execution of this most sombre of duties: the pre-pub round-up. Every weekend, we perform the pub-lic duty (geddit?) of getting you all sped up on the week’s news before you hit the Babycham, a five minute read which will stop you looking thick in front of your mates. Here it is, in all it shabby, sad glory. Have fun out there and we will – regrettably – see you next week.  It’s been a big, big week for fans of the grotesque gap between society’s richest and poorest. The Bank of England , the type of figure that would have looked like an economic meltdown 12 months ago but is now considered sort of normal. As basic goods like food and energy get more expensive, incomes are being squeezed, leaving millions poorer in real terms. But never mind that,   AND WE’RE ALL VERY HAPPY FOR THEM. WOOOOOOOOOOOO! The war in Ukraine is further pushing up the price of staple goods, with wheat exports grinding to a halt due to the blockade of the Black Sea, plus the impact of sanctions on the Russian fertiliser market. UN bosses are   again in a bid to save developing countries from starvation. The Bank of England has warned the price of goods on supermarket shelves  .

Downing Street has   to address the dire economic situation, despite Rishi Sunak admitting a ‘perfect storm’ of factors means ‘tough’ times lie ahead for the country. But forget all that, THE ! ARGHHHHHHHHH It’s been more than two years since Covid-19 turned us all into stockpiling, agoraphobic hermits, tunelessly whistling happy birthday (twice) while we scrubbed the recently healed layer of skin off our knuckles. Now there’s a new virus on the block to be absolutely terrified of: monkeypox. It’s endemic in parts of Africa but several  have put global health authorities on red alert. There’s no need to panic just yet, disease experts tell us. There have been a small number of cases so far, it doesn’t appear to spread very easily and it isn’t airborne, meaning you need to come into close physical contact with an infected person to catch it. But the news that  – along with outbreaks in the US, Canada, Spain, Germany, Italy and more – is enough to make the more hypochondriacal among us start cleaning our post with bleach wipes again. Gay and bi males in the UK are being asked to be on the lookout for symptoms, with evidence pointing to transmission taking place through sex (or at least the close contact associated with a roll in the hay) and a disproportionate number of cases showing up among men who have sex with other men. The government is dusting off smallpox vaccines to use on health workers who may have been exposed and are buying more just in case. Honestly though, don’t worry too much, it’s probably all fine!

Since  , where we reported that pretty much nothing had changed on the ground, we must inform you once more than pretty much nothing has changed on the ground.

But the PM, a man with a toddler-like ability to face plant at full speed and then get up and keep running, seems to have gotten away with it. Of course, he still broke his own law, that much is beyond dispute – but his measly single fine will unlikely be enough to convince the bastions of moral purity on the Tory backbenches to unseat him, meaning he is seemingly safe in Number 10.

Monekypox ‘spreading in community’ after two more cases found in UK,Faye Brown,2022-05-18 20:07:00,"Two more cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK – bringing the total to nine, according to the UK Health Security Agency (HSA). One case was reported in   while another was found in south-east England.  Experts said it is possible the new cases were caused by community transmission because the individuals affected have no travel links to a country where monkeypox is endemic. The latest ones do not have known links with previous confirmed cases announced on 7, 14 and 16 May.  The HSA said the virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population remains low. Recent cases are predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (MSM). People in these groups are being advised to look out for any usual rashes or lesions on their bodies, particularly their genitals, and to contact a sexual health service if they are concerned. Monkeypox can be passed on by direct contact though sex, but is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: ‘These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities. ‘UKHSA has quickly identified cases so far and we continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. ‘We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay if they have concerns.

The health agency also said that initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

UK monkeypox cases ‘set to double today’ with fears infections are spiralling,Sam Corbishley,2022-05-20 08:42:00,"The UK’s monkeypox outbreak has more than doubled, health officials will reportedly announce today. Two additional cases were identified on Wednesday, bringing the total to nine, but a further 11 are set to be announced on Friday, according to  . Britain has around 5,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine, which is around 85% effective, but ministers are said to have ordered another 20,000 vials to cope with an expected surge in infections. It is believed the two recently confirmed cases, one in   and the other in southeast England, were infected in the UK as neither had travel links to a country where the virus is endemic. The monkeypox virus causes only mild illness but the outbreak is causing concern in government due to the similar spread in some European countries. In recent cases, patients have self-identified as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men (MSM). The UK Health Security Agency is advising gay, bisexual and MSM men to check for any usual rashes or lesions on their bodies, particularly their genitals, and to contact a sexual health service if they are concerned. Monkeypox can be passed on by direct contact though sex, but is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection. Dr Susan Hopkins, UKHSA’s chief medical adviser, said: ‘We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay if they have concerns.’ Monkeypox cases are usually found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere. That is why outbreaks reported in Britain, Portugal, Spain and the United States have cased alarm among public health experts. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off. The incubation period of monkeypox is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days. – To date, there are nine cases in the UK, with the initial case having returned from travel to Nigeria. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that, based on currently available information, some people are catching the infection in the UK. As of May 15, two confirmed cases were in the same family (these were unconnected to the initial case). Separately, six other cases have been confirmed in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men who have attended sexual health services. Two of these cases have known contacts in common. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, and through the coughs and sneezes of somebody with the infection. The virus spreads through close contact and the UKHSA is advising people, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or who have sex with men, to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body. Anyone who is worried is advised to contact sexual health services and to call ahead for an appointment, or to call 111. Londonâs Public Health Director   explains why we are asking everyone, but particularly gay and bisexual men, to be on the lookout for any unusual rashes or blister-like lesions after the recent discovery of several   cases in England.  — UK Health Security Agency (@UKHSA)  
 The UKHSA said the virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population overall remains low. London’s public health director, Professor Kevin Fenton, has said plans are in place to stock up on treatments in case infections rise in the capital. These include vaccines and antiviral medicines, with household contacts of those infected possibly offered jabs. The UKHSA is carrying out contact tracing of people who have been in close contact with the affected. The health agency said the virus does not spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population remains low. Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health clinic, although they are urged to notify the clinic before attending. The rash, which can develop as part of the virus, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The health agency also said that initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. The first case was a person who had recently travelled to Nigeria, which is where they were believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to the UK. . Not convinced?

First US monkeypox case confirmed in Massachusetts,Jessica Kwong,2022-05-18 22:22:00,"The first human case of monkeypox in the US this year was confirmed in Massachusetts on Wednesday.  It was found in an adult male who recently visited Canada, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which finished initial testing on Tuesday. The case has been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  ‘The case poses no risk to the public, and the individual is hospitalized and in good condition,’ stated the state health department. ‘DPH is working closely with the CDC, relevant local boards of health, and the patient’s health care providers to identify individuals who may have been in contact with the patient while he was infectious.’ It comes the same day that  , bringing the country’s total to nine, according to the UK Health Security Agency (HSA). The outbreak of the rare disease has  , with 15 and eight cases confirmed, respectively, Iberian health officials said.  Also on Wednesday, CDC officials said that they are monitoring up to six possible monkeypox cases in people who traveled into the US on a plane carrying an infected passenger. Monkeypox, caused by a virus of the same name, was first detected in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it spread to central and western African countries. It can be transmitted when an infected animal such as a rodent or primate bites or scratches a human.  The disease travels in large airborne respiratory droplets that cannot move more than a few feet, meaning it is only passed along with prolonged close contact.  Symptoms include lesions and rashes on the face or genitals, muscle aches, fever, headache, fatigue and chills. Individuals who contracted the virus in Europe reportedly have skin lesions and are in stable condition. Monkeypox does not naturally occur in the US and most infections have been found in people coming back from countries where it is more common, according to the CDC. Recent cases include a Maryland resident in November 2021 who returned from Nigeria and a Texas resident in July 2021 who also went there.  . Not convinced?

Four more people infected with monkeypox in ‘rare and unusual’ spread,Faye Brown,2022-05-16 17:49:00,"Four more people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, bringing the total number to seven.  All of the new cases self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, the Health Security Agency (HSA) said.  They were thought to be infected in London and have no apparent travel links to Africa, where the virus is endemic. Investigations are now underway to establish any links between the new cases and how exactly they were infected.  The four new cases are not connected to the previous  and the case  .  However, two of the new cases are known to each other.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser of UKHSA, said: ‘This is rare and unusual.  ‘UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.  ‘We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. ‘We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.’ Three of the new cases are in London and one linked case is in the North East of England. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980.  Although monkeypox is much milder than smallpox, with most infected people recovering within a few weeks, it can in rare cases be fatal. Monkeypox is often mistaken for more common rash illnesses like chickenpox, measles, scabies and syphilis, which makes it difficult to diagnose early. All seven UK cases have tested positive for the West African strain of the virus, which is believed to be milder than the other version.  HSA said those patients needing medical care are all in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hosptial, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and Guys’ and St Thomas Exactly how the new patients acquired the infection ‘remains under urgent investigation’, the HSA said Officials said the virus does not spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population is low. However, the most recent cases are in  gay and bisexual men.  The health body is therefore asking these groups ‘to be alert’ to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. The latest cases mean that there are currently seven confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, diagnosed between 6th and 15th May.  The first case was connected to travel to Nigeria but none of the other cases appear to be linked to that case or any country where monkeypox is endemic.  Investigations are underway to establish any more cases in the UK and if there have been similar rises in other countries.  Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off.        Not convinced?

Monkeypox outbreak spreads to Spain and Portugal,Sean Seddon,2022-05-18 16:54:00,"An outbreak of monkeypox which has already been identified in the UK appears to have spread to Portugal and Spain. Iberian health authorities confirmed 15 and eight suspected cases of the smallpox-like disease respectively.  The viral illness is endemic in parts of Central and West Africa but infections outside the continent are rare. Seven  , all in men who identify as ‘gay, bisexual or men who have sex with other men’, according to the Health Security Agency. Of the four new infections announced this week, three are in London and a third linked case was confirmed in the North East. Health authorities are racing to understand how the disease is passing from person to person, especially where travel to a known hotspot has been ruled out. The disease belongs to the family of viruses that includes chickenpox and smallpox, with most infected people making a full recovery within weeks. It typically causes fever, chills, a rash and lesions on the face or genitals. Treatments and vaccines developed to tackle smallpox appear to be effective in fighting monkeypox. Portugal’s General Directorate for Health said its cases were identified around Lisbon and all involved young men, but did not say if they have travel links to Africa or the UK. Those infected are said to have skin lesions but are reported to be in stable conditions. The World Health Organisation said the spread of monkeypox in the UK needed to be investigated to understand how the disease was being transmitted. UK experts say there appears to be a possibility it is passing from person to person via sex, described by Neil Mabbott, a disease expert at the University of Edinburgh, as a ‘novel means of spread’ Keith Neal, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Nottingham, said the transmission might not have occurred through sexual activity but just ‘the close contact associated with sexual intercourse’. Doctor Susan Hopkins, the UK HSA’s chief medical adviser, said this week: ‘This is rare and unusual.  ‘UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. ‘We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. ‘We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.’ .

Why is chickenpox called chickenpox? All the theories,Zoe Adams,2022-05-08 15:51:00,"A highly contagious disease that causes red, itchy spots all over the body is an illness many of us have dealt with – but why is it called that? And where did it come from? Chickenpox –   – is a common disease, more popular in children than adults, that leaves us feeling itchy, run-down, and generally unwell. Very easily spread from one person to the next, you can catch the infection simply by being in the same room as someone with it. But while we all commonly know the  , there’s a lot of interest as to how exactly it got its unusual name. Also, where did the infectious disease come from? Here are all the facts and theories around the name ‘chickenpox’. The official name for chickenpox is Varicella but unfortunately, there is no definitive answer on how it came to the name we commonly know it by today. However, there are plenty of theories. Firstly, many assume the name chickenpox came from the common symptom of large blisters on the body that look like chickpeas. And the ‘pox’ part is derived from the fact it’s in the smallpox family. Another theory comes from the idea the chickenpox rash looks like a chicken itself has pecked you all over the body. A different idea comes from way back in the 18th century when a doctor named it chickenpox because it was a milder form of smallpox, and was therefore more ‘chicken’ (cowardly). Chickenpox has been around for centuries, in fact there’s evidence of it dating back to ancient times. Historians believe the disease was first brought to America in the 15th century from Europe. A lot of people connect chickenpox with smallpox, however, they are two entirely separate infections with smallpox being much more severe. While they both cause a rash and blisters and have ‘pox’ in the name, they are quite different, with smallpox practically being extinct thanks to the creation of a vaccine 65 years ago.

Contact tracing under way after rare case of monkeypox identified in UK,Sean Seddon,2022-05-07 15:13:00,"Health officials are racing to trace people who may have come into contact with a person infected with monkeypox. A rare case of the infection has been identified in a patient in England, health chiefs have confirmed. The UK Health Security Agency said the potentially serious infection was detected in an individual who fell ill after visiting Nigeria. They are now receiving care at the infectious disease unit at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust,  . Monkeypox produces a similar to disease to smallpox but has a lower death rate. It is able to pass from animals to humans and is known to be present in primate populations, especially in central and western Africa. The first case in the UK was recorded in 2018 and was again linked to travel to Nigeria. Scientists have confirmed the disease can pass from human to human via close contact with an infected person. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off. Health officials have stressed most people recover from the illness and it does not spread easily.

A major outbreak, the first in the Western hemisphere, occurred in the United States in 2003. Cases were identified in several states but none were fatal and all could be traced back to the sale of prairie dogs, with human to human transmission not a factor. . Not convinced?

Second person struck down with deadly monkeypox virus just days after first case recorded in UK,Tanveer Mann,2018-09-12 08:33:00,"The patient, who had travelled to Nigeria, arrived at Blackpool Victoria Hospital with symptoms of the disease, Public Health England (PHE) said. They are now being treated at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, a specialist centre. Health officials say the virus is often spread through handling monkeys and proves fatal in 10% of cases. The first case of the disease was recorded on Friday in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall. The patient was transferred to the expert infectious disease unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London on Saturday morning. Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of PHE’s National Infection Service, said the two cases are not related but added that it was ‘unusual’ to see two cases in such a short space of time. He said: ‘We know that in September 2017 Nigeria experienced a large sustained outbreak of monkeypox and since then sporadic cases have continued to be reported.’ ‘It is likely monkeypox continues to circulate in Nigeria and could therefore affect travellers who are returning from this part of the world. ‘However, it is very unusual to see two cases in such a relatively short space of time.’ Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to smallpox though not as deadly, that was first discovered in monkeys in 1958. The first case of it in humans was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970, and since cases have been reported in central and west African countries. Symptoms include fever, headache and chills and, as the illness develops, large welts can appear over the face and body. Humans can catch monkeypox through direct contact with animals, such as handling monkeys, or eating inadequately cooked meat. It can pass between humans via droplets in the air, and by touching the skin of an infected individual, or touching objects contaminated by them.

What is monkeypox? Signs and symptoms of the virus,Jessica Lindsay,2018-09-26 17:04:00,"Three cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in England, as a healthcare worker from Blackpool was reported to have contracted the disease. It’s an extremely rare disease, and is zoonotic, so is normally seen in animals. It can, however, be transferred to humans, as we’ve seen from the recent news. Find out everything you need to know about the disease here. Monkeypox is a orthopoxvirus. Although it’s not a descendent or ancestor of smallpox, it has similar symptoms (although they’re milder and there’s a lower death rate). It’s most commonly seen in monkeys and rodents, but has been known to be passed to humans. There was an outbreak in the US in 2003, which was as a result of a giant Gambian rats. The most recent major outbreak was in Nigeria in 2017, and the first UK patient to be found with monkeypox had just returned from Nigeria. The disease is not highly contagious, and is relatively mild. It’s unlikely you’ll come into contact with monkeypox, and if you do the chance of getting seriously ill are very low,. The early stages of monkeypox can be characterised by a high fever, intense headache, swelling of lymph nodes and aching muscles, say the WHO. Those infected are also likely to have a lack of energy in the first five days after contracting the disease. A rash will appear one to three days after the fever, often beginning on the face before spreading elsewhere on the body. This rash is then likely to evolve into lesions with flat bases, blisters or pustules, followed by crusts, in approximately 10 days. The symptoms can be known to last two to three weeks as the virus is a self-limited disease, meaning it is restricted in its duration. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said: ‘Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. ‘Most people recover within several weeks.’

"Deadly flu outbreak could spread in 36 hours and kill 80,000,000 people, experts warn",Lucy Middleton,2019-09-18 10:10:00,"It could take just 36 hours for an airborne illness to travel around the world and kill 80,000,000 people, experts have warned. Current efforts to prepare for a deadly outbreak are ‘grossly insufficient’, a new report by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) has revealed. Instead, a future pandemic similar to the Spanish flu could spread faster than ever before due to modern advances in international travel, the document said. Entitled ‘A World At Risk’, the report states: ‘The threat of a pandemic spreading around the globe is a real one. ‘A quick-moving pathogen has the potential to kill tens of millions of people, disrupt economies and destabilise national security.’ The report said some governments and agencies had made efforts to prepare for deadly diseases after the devastating Ebola outbreak left over 10,000 people dead between 2014 and 2016. However, it said those efforts were ‘grossly insufficient’, adding that world leaders had ignored many of the recommendations made in an earlier report. It said: ‘Many of the recommendations reviewed were poorly implemented, or not implemented at all, and serious gaps persist. ‘For too long, we have allowed a cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: we ramp up efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them when the threat subsides. It is well past time to act.’ The report added that the threat of a ‘rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen’ is ‘very real’. This could kill between 50,000,000 to 80,000,000 people and wipe out nearly five per cent of the world’s economy, it said. It continued: ‘A global pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic, creating widespread havoc, instability and insecurity. The world is not prepared.’ Many national health systems, particularly in poorer countries, would collapse as a a result, the research said. A global map showing a list of possible illnesses that could spark an outbreak included Ebola, Zika and Nipah viruses, which were all described as ‘newly emerging’. It also listed measles, yellow fever, Dengue, the plague and human monkeypox as ‘re-emerging and re-surging’ diseases. An outbreak of these viruses could be worse than in history due to how often people now travel, the report said. The GPMB is led by former World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general and past Norwegian prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and Alhadj As Sy, the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The experts ended their report by recommending that governments put money aside in preparation for a potential pandemic and called on G7, G20 and G77 states to lead by example. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, current director-general of the WHO, urged world leaders to invest in strengthening health systems and boost funding into technology. He said they need to ‘heed the lessons these outbreaks are teaching us’ and ‘fix the roof before the rain comes’. Earlier this year, the WHO warned that another pandemic of flu is ‘inevitable’, and urged governments to begin their preparation. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at  .

Monkeypox diagnosed in healthcare worker at Blackpool hospital,Richard Hartley-Parkinson,2018-09-26 10:43:00,"A healthcare worker has become the third person to be diagnosed with monkeypox in England. The individual was involved in the care of a patient at Blackpool Victoria Hospital earlier this month, before they were known to be carrying the infection, Public Health England (PHE) said. The patient – who was only the second case of the rare infection recorded in the UK – is believed to have contracted the virus after travelling to Nigeria. The first case was diagnosed just days earlier, after a resident of Nigeria staying at a naval base in Cornwall presented with symptoms. PHE previously said there was ‘no UK link’ between the first two patients. Monkeypox does not spread easily between people and most who contract the infection recover within a few weeks, although severe illness can occur in some people. However, Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said the third case is ‘not wholly unexpected’. The third individual is being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Dr Phin said: ‘This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made. ‘We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly. It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified. ‘This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced.’ There was a large outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and sporadic cases have been reported since. According to the World Health Organisation monkeypox is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. The disease is zoonotic, which means it normally exists in animals but can also be transferred to humans. In the case of monkeypox, the disease is mostly transmitted to people from animals such as rodents and primates. The infection primarily occurs in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rainforests. In a case found in Cornwall, the person is believed to have contracted the infection in Nigeria before travelling to the UK. The early stages of monkeypox can be characterised by a high fever, intense headache, swelling of lymph nodes and aching muscles, say the WHO. Those infected are also likely to have a lack of energy in the first five days after contracting the disease. A rash will appear one to three days after the fever, often beginning on the face before spreading elsewhere on the body. This rash is then likely to evolve into lesions with flat bases, blisters or pustules, followed by crusts, in approximately 10 days. The symptoms can be known to last two to three weeks as the virus is a self-limited disease, meaning it is restricted in its duration. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said: ‘Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. ‘Most people recover within several weeks.’ Public Health England states that while monkeypox can be passed on, the disease does not spread easily. They have contacted 50 people who were in close proximity to the man diagnosed with the disease in Cornwall this week – but say that the risk of infection to the general population is ‘very low’. The virus can be passed on but does not spread easily (Picture: Getty)‘People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution,’ PHE said in a statement. ‘Those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.’ While there are no specific treatments for monkeypox, vaccination against smallpox has proven to be very effective.

Monkeypox healthcare worker thinks she caught virus changing patient’s bedsheets,Zoe Drewett,2018-09-27 10:04:00,"The healthcare worker who is the third person to be diagnosed with monkeypox in England reportedly blames the NHS-provided gloves she wore while changing another monkeypox patient’s bedsheets. She also believes she may have passed the virus onto her husband after he woke up with spots covering his entire face. The mother-of-two, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, it thought to have caught monkeypox while treating a patient at Blackpool Victoria Hospital earlier this month, before they were known to be carrying the infection, Public Health England (PHE) said. According to   the 40-year-old woman – who has not been named – blamed ‘pathetically small’ hospital-provided gloves that did not cover her arms as she changed the patient’s bedding. The healthcare assistant developed flu-like symptoms after working at the hospital. She believes her 50-year-old husband is also a victim after he developed spots on his face – one of the symptoms of the virus. ‘The gloves were too short to cover my arms and left my skin exposed while changing the bed. I think that’s how I got infected,’ she told The Sun. ‘They told us we weren’t at risk — but that’s obviously nonsense. I’m terrified about what may happen to me and my family.’ Symptoms of monkeypox — which is similar to smallpox in humans — include scabbing, fever, headache, muscle aches and chills. There was a large outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and sporadic cases have been reported since. Although the hospital worker is the third person to be diagnosed with the virus in the UK, she is believed to be the first to be infected in the country. The first person – a resident of Nigeria staying at a naval base in Cornwall – was diagnosed recently. The second case of the rare infection recorded in the UK – the woman’s patient – is believed to have contracted the virus after travelling to Nigeria. On Wednesday night, the heathcare worker was believed to have been placed in a specialist unit at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, where she was taken by emergency staff wearing biohazard gear a day before. Officials at Public Health England had insisted the risk of infection was low and that there was ‘no risk to other staff, patients or visitors’. Monkeypox does not spread easily between people and most who contract the infection recover within a few weeks, although severe illness can occur in some people. First infection results from direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals. In Africa human infections have been documented through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels, with rodents being the most likely carriers of the virus. Eating inadequately cooked meat of infected animals is also a possible risk factor. Secondary, or human-to-human, transmission can result from close contact with infected respiratory tract secretions, skin lesions of an infected person or objects recently contaminated by patient fluids or lesion materials. Transmission occurs primarily via droplet respiratory particles usually requiring prolonged face-to-face contact, which puts household members of active cases at greater risk of infection. Transmission can also occur by inoculation or via the placenta (congenital monkeypox). There is no evidence, to date, that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox infections in the human population. 
 PHE previously said there was ‘no UK link’ between the first two patients. But Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said the third case is ‘not wholly unexpected’. Dr Phin said: ‘This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made. ‘We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly. ‘It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified. ‘This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced.’ If you have a story for our news team, email us at  .

"What is monkeypox, what are the symptoms and should we be worried?",Lucy Middleton,2018-09-09 10:46:00,"The first ever UK case of monkeypox was recorded on Friday at a naval base in Cornwall. But just what is the viral infection and how dangerous is it? , monkeypox is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. The disease is zoonotic, which means it normally exists in animals but can also be transferred to humans. In the case of monkeypox, the disease is mostly transmitted to people from animals such as rodents and primates. But British people should not be too concerned – the infection primarily occurs in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rainforests. In the case found in Cornwall, the person is believed to have contracted the infection in Nigeria before travelling to the UK. The early stages of monkeypox can be characterised by a high fever, intense headache, swelling of lymph nodes and aching muscles, say the WHO. Those infected are also likely to have a lack of energy in the first five days after contracting the disease. A rash will appear one to three days after the fever, often beginning on the face before spreading elsewhere on the body. This rash is then likely to evolve into lesions with flat bases, blisters or pustules, followed by crusts, in approximately 10 days. The symptoms can be known to last two to three weeks as the virus is a self-limited disease, meaning it is restricted in its duration. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said: ‘Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. ‘Most people recover within several weeks.’ Public Health England states that while monkeypox can be passed on, the disease does not spread easily. They have contacted 50 people who were in close proximity to the man diagnosed with the disease in Cornwall this week – but say that the risk of infection to the general population is ‘very low’. The virus can be passed on but does not spread easily (Picture: Getty)‘People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution,’ PHE said in a statement. ‘Those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.’ While there are no specific treatments for monkeypox, vaccination against smallpox has proven to be very effective. In short, it would look like the answer is no. The disease is a mild condition which should disappear of its own accord and is unlikely to spread to a wider pool of people. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, confirmed: ‘Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. ‘Most people recover within several weeks. It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. ‘It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. ‘We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.’ If you have a story for our news team, email us at  .

First ever UK case of deadly Monkeypox discovered in Cornwall,Kate Buck,2018-09-08 22:10:00,"The rare viral infection was found on Friday in a Nigerian national staying at a naval base in Cornwall, Public Health England (PHE) said. The patient was transferred to the expert infectious disease unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London on Saturday morning. The person is believed to have contracted the infection in Nigeria before travelling to the UK. , Monkeypox is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980, and is transferred from animals to humans. Although it is milder than smallpox, it can be fatal and children are most at risk of dying from the disease. PHE said monkeypox does not spread easily and most patients recover within a few weeks, but it can cause severe illness in some people. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off. PHE said that as a precautionary measure, it is working with experts in the NHS to contact a number of people who were on the same flight as the patient. It has not been revealed whether the patient is a member of the military, or what gender they are. PHE said in a statement: ‘People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.’ The organisation said passengers that are not contacted should not worry. Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said: ‘Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. ‘Most people recover within several weeks. ‘It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. ‘It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. ‘We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.’ Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: ‘PHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported and infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.’ Monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo when a nine-year-old boy was diagnosed.

New monkeypox symptoms identified - pseudo-pustules that lead to ulcers,Malvika Padin,2022-08-03 12:49:00," Cases of monkeypox are continuing to rise globally, with  two new deaths being recorded in Europe .   While  typical signs of the disease  include a rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, the most recent review of 185 cases - published in the British Journal Dermatology - has identified a new skin symptom related to the illness.  Dr Ignacio García Doval, coordinator of the research from the Spanish Academy of Dermatology, said: "" Our research shows that the symptoms of the current outbreak are unusual and there is evidence that this is due to skin-to-skin contact during sex."" He added: ""Rather than the typical widespread rash seen in past cases, recent cases tend to have far fewer skin lesions, often in one location.""  Here's what you need to know about pseudo-pustules, the new  monkeypox  skin symptom identified by experts.  Monkeypox, which comes from the same family of viruses causing smallpox, is often described as causing pustules, which are pus-filled lesions. However, medics have spotted a new sign appearing on the skin in the most recent monkeypox outbreak: pseudo-pustules. Pseudo-pustules are similar in appearance to pustules, except they are white and solid and don't actually contain any pus. While the top layer of typical pustules can be scraped off to get to the pus inside, that's not possible with the pseudo-pustules. This means that lesions from pseudo-pustules can lead to ulcers. This symptom is important to note, with experts warning that there are very few diseases that produce this type of reaction.  People who have been infected with monkeypox typically develop symptoms such as fever, sore muscles, swollen lymph nodes,  headaches  and sweating.  A distinct rash breaks out between one to four days of infections, with lesions developing mostly over the face as well as over the palms, soles and mucosa (the moist, inner lining of the nose and mouth). These lesions generally scab over and fall off, and the infections resolve within two to four weeks. There might be secondary scarring from the rashes as pustules can get very itchy. However, complications may occur in some people including encephalitis, pneumonia, secondary bacterial skin infection, as well as visual loss. Infants, children and those with weakened immune system are at greater risk for developing complications from monkeypox.

3 monkeypox symptoms found on the face - 'pimples' to lesions in mouth and throat,Jessica Knibbs,2022-08-08 10:59:00,"Monkeypox was first discovered at the end of the 1950s , but since then there are signs it has undergone recent changes that have enabled it to pass between humans more easily.  Since May 2022 there have a spate of outbreaks reported in the US, UK, Australia, mainland Europe and Canada.  Health officials say that people should avoid close personal contact with someone who has an illness presenting with a distinctive  rash .   This  monkeypox  rash is known to first appear on the face has been described to resemble pimples with other face symptoms to be aware of.   According to recent  NHS  updates, the UK has had 2,432 cases, up 224 since July 21.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is encouraging anyone who develops ""a new, unexplained skin rash"" on any part of the body to seek medical care immediately and avoid contact with others.  Monkeypox symptoms are similar to those of smallpox, including fever,  headaches , muscle aches, chills exhaustion and a rash similar to pimples.  “The rash typically started on the face and spread to many areas of the body,” says the American Academy of Dermatology Association The health site continued: “People usually had between 10 and 150 pox-like bumps on their skin. “Some people developed more than 200 bumps.” According to Rosamund Lewis, World Health Organisation’s (WHO) head smallpox secretariat, a rash appearing starts as red discolouration in the skin. It usually starts on the face and then progresses to the arms and legs, then hands and feet, and then the rest of the body. This phase also lasts one to two days. Next comes what are referred to as papules, when the rash becomes raised on the skin, instead of flat, also lasting one to two days. One study published in BMJ looked at 197 participants, all of whom had tested positive for monkeypox. All participants had lesions on the skin or mucus membranes as their only symptom. These lesions were found to be located to the genital and anal areas as well as in and around the mouth and throat. These rashes around the anus and genitals had not always spread to other parts of the body, and often appeared before symptoms like fever, noted the researchers. The NHS  added: “You should contact your sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters, anal pain or bleeding from your bottom and have either:  The national health body added: “Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people, including sharing towels or bedding, until you've been told what to do.”   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/3-monkeypox-symptoms-found-face-27645221,The Mirror
Two painful Monkeypox symptoms you should never ignore - including swollen penis,Jack Abela,2022-07-29 11:28:00," As  monkeypox  cases continue to surge, the  World Health Organisation  has declared the virus a '  global health emergency  ', the highest alert possible.  More than 16,000 cases have now been reported from 75 countries, said WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. According to the latest data available, there have been five deaths. So far, there have been over 2,000 confirmed cases reported in the UK. Monkeypox in humans was first discovered in the early 1970s in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Ghebreyesus said: ""This is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups."" But what are the symptoms of monkeypox and are the reports of penis swelling and pain linked to the virus?  According to the  NHS , monkeypox is a rare infection most commonly found in west or central Africa. There has recently been an increase in cases in the UK, but the risk of catching it is low.  The first symptoms of monkeypox include: These symptoms usually occur one to five days before a rash appears. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body. This can include the genitals and anus.  In a study conducted between May and July 2022, by Julia Bilinska and her colleagues at Guy’s and St Thomas’  NHS Foundation  Trust in London, 31 men out of 197 who had contracted monkeypox complained of penis swelling.  However, as of July 29, the NHS, WHO and US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention do not recognise penis swelling as a symptom of the virus. But all the participants involved in the research did have some form of lesion on their skin or mucous membranes. According to the NHS, monkeypox is usually mild and most people recover within a few weeks without treatment.  Because of the similarity to smallpox, the  smallpox vaccine is believed to offer protection to monkeypox  as well.  The NHS is currently offering the smallpox vaccination (MVA) to those who are most at risk of being exposed to it. This includes: Please call 111 or get in touch with your GP if you are showing symptoms or concerned you have contracted the virus.

"UK Monkeypox cases hit 2,859 as doctor urges vigilance despite signs outbreak has slowed",Kieren Williams,2022-08-05 22:28:00," The number of  monkeypox  cases in the UK has hit 2,859 as doctors have urged vigilance despite signs the outbreak is “plateauing”.  The latest figures released by the government suggest that the ongoing outbreak has begun to slow down. It comes as the second death from monkeypox in Europe was confirmed last week. Since the last update, there have been an additional 100 confirmed or highly probable cases.  So far, the majority of people who have been affected are men who are  gay , bisexual or men who have sex with other men.  London remains the epicentre of the UK’s outbreak accounting for 73 per cent of cases. The past few weeks have seen a small number of women confirmed to have monkeypox but, so far, the government said there was no evidence to suggest transmission existed outside of “interconnected sexual networks”. Whilst 22 cases in women have been identified, 99 per cent of all UK cases are men. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said: “While the most recent data suggests the growth of the outbreak has slowed, we cannot be complacent. Be vigilant of and check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. “The smallpox vaccine is being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox in order to offer them protection and to reduce the spread of disease.” England has seen an additional 92 cases reported, with one in Northern Ireland, two in Scotland and five in Wales. London: 1954 (+48) South East: 237 (+4) North West: 150 (+6) East of England: 103 (+1) West Midlands: 85 (+9) South West: 65 (+11) Yorkshire and Humber: 55 (+6) East Midlands: 39 (+6) North East: 29 (0) As things stand the outbreak in England is classified as ‘Level 2’ which is defined as being within a set ‘sub-population’, as in men who are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with other men. The primary method of transmission of monkeypox continues to be through close or sexual contact. Whilst the virus has been detected in air and environmental samples in the hospital room of infected patients, there are no confirmed instances of airborne transmission. A vaccine for monkeypox is currently being offered to those most at risk.   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-monkeypox-cases-hit-2859-27671110,The Mirror
Monkeypox: Expert reveals all you need to know as virus declared global health emergency,Alice Peacock,2022-07-29 18:28:00," An epidemiologist is urging the nation to take  monkeypox  seriously and tackle stigma around the disease as it expands to a level that will cause a “significant burden on services”.   The disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, was declared a    global health emergency    two weeks ago by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  More than 19,000 monkeypox cases have been reported worldwide in 76 countries since the global outbreak began at the beginning of Spring. According to figures from the UK Health Agency, there were 2,469 confirmed and 77 highly probable monkeypox cases in the UK as of 28 July 2022 - 2,546 in total. The virus was predominantly being passed on in interconnected sexual networks.  Brits are now being urged to check for rashes or blisters before mingling with others, while a    vaccination programme    against monkeypox is being stepped up by the  NHS .   As health services around the UK fight to get the spread of the disease under control, epidemiologist  Kevin Fenton, t he  Public Health Director for London for London and President of the Faculty of Public Health has answered your questions about how to handle the disruption monkeypox may have on our lives.  “As a newly emerged and infectious disease here in the UK, we should all be concerned, because what we really don’t want to happen is for monkeypox to become established here in the UK and to become endemic,"" Professor Fenton said. While anyone can get monkeypox, the majority of cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Professor Fenton said: “We know that the vast majority of cases that we’re seeing are currently been seen among gay, bisexual, and other men having sex with men, so we’re also keen that that community is very much aware of the signs and symptoms, that they’re getting the vaccines that are now available and that they’re taking care to reduce transmissions. However, the professor said that all of us need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of monkeypox, what to do if we have symptoms we are concerned about and how to manage the disease. “The fact that it’s connected to other outbreaks which are occurring globally, means that it’s a public health priority for us and our members. Public health practitioners across the country are involved in partnership with the NHS in helping to control the outbreak,"" he said.  Professor Fenton said young children, fell into an older age category or were more vulnerable  immunologically, could have more severe presentations of the disease. ""Thankfully we have seen very, very few cases in those age groups at this point, both in the UK and internationally,"" he said. The epidemiologist said health bodies in the UK were keeping a close eye out to see if there were any cases that fell into these brackets. Professor Fenton said it monkeypox was ""not likely"" to become as widespread as Covid, as it was not as easily transmissible. Monkeypox spreads through “very close physical contact between an infected person and an uninfected person” either directly or through infected clothing or bedlinen. “What is more likely if that we will continue to spread within these interconnected networks of men-on-men interconnected networks and their partners,"" Professor Fenton said. ""Therefore it really is important that we work with the most affected networks now, to take them through vaccination, raise awareness and make sure we have good services in place to contain the outbreak,"" Professor Fenton said. Stigma around monkeypox, which was disproportionately affecting particular subgroups within the population, was one of Professor Fenton's main concerns around the UK's response to the outbreak. ""What we’ve learnt from other infectious diseases is that where there is stigma, it will prevent other people from coming forward and being identified,"" he said. ""It may prevent them from getting the treatment that they need, and they often have a worse outcome."" Professor Fenton said that tackling stigma was ""important"" and was being done by working with the community to ensure transparent messaging and that communication that is going out on monkeypox was culturally competent and relevant to that group. “A lot of the messaging from the UK Health Security Agency has been developed in partnership with with the gay, bisexual and men having sex with men community,"" he said. ""We ensure that we develop services that are relevant to the lives of men - convenient, accessible, friendly and open, but also confidential."" Monkeypox commonly starts off as a flu-like illness before the infected person develops lesions, blisters, bumps or pustules on the skin, often around the mouth and genital area. “When it is severe, you can have those blisters bumps and the pustules developing around the mouth and the genital area. It can be exceedingly painful and for some people it can prevent them from going to the bathroom, using the toilet effectively,"" Professor Fenton said. “Because of where it is located some people can get bacterial infections and they require admission to hospital for antibiotics and also very strong painkillers. "" While a majority of sufferers in the UK seemed to have ""very mild"" presentations, Professor Fenton said they were now seeing ""significant numbers"" that had a severe infection requiring hospital admission and in some cases, intensive care. ""We have more than 2,000 people who have been diagnosed in the UK; that’s going to be a significant burden on services,"" he said. Professor Fenton said the UK has been at the forefront of not only applying testing for monkeypox but looking at new diagnostic tests for it. ""We do have a variety of tests being done - they have been done in specialist centres but now the test kits and diagnostic kits are available in a variety of healthcare settings, so we’re better able to diagnose monkeypox earlier,"" he said. NHS staff across the country have started vaccinating eligible gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM), and frontline staff at risk of exposure, as well as those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case. The public is being asked to wait to be contacted - with the head of the NHS vaccination programme urging those who are invited to come forward at the earliest possible opportunity. While more severe cases of monkeypox required hospital treatment, Professor Fenton said mild cases of monkeypox could be managed at home. ""The most important thing once people had a diagnosis is that they stay at home and they isolate themselves, so they reduce the risk of spreading it to others. We are asking people now, to help control the outbreak, that once you have a sign of a lump or a pustule around your mouth or your genital area, to not have sex with anyone. Don’t go out and mix, to help reduce the risk of spreading it to others."" For less severe cases, Professor Fenton said there were clinics which offered check-in services from home where a medical professional would check in on a daily basis to ensure a patient's symptoms weren't getting any worse. “The people who are having more blisters or significant pain, whose blisters are becoming infected, will be advised to come into hospital where they can be isolated and managed as an inpatient. Then they have a range of both antibiotics that may be necessary and antiviral treatments which are given to help reduce the severity of the disease,"" he said. “The thing about monkeypox is that it takes a long time to go through the various phases of the illness,"" Professor Fenton said. ""It starts off with a flu-like illness, it may also be associated with the initial blisters or pustules around the mouth or genital area. The blisters then spread across the body and then they dry, scab and fall off."" The whole process could take three to four weeks, the epidemiologist said, and those with the disease were urged to stay at home and remain isolated until the last scab has dried up and fallen off.

Second death from monkeypox confirmed in Europe as outbreak continues to spread,Douglas Patient,2022-07-30 12:16:00,"The second death in Europe from the  monkeypox  virus has been confirmed in Spain as cases climb worldwide. Spain had  reported its first death  as recently as Friday, shortly after Brazil reported the first monkeypox-related death outside the African continent in the current wave of the disease.  The Brazilian victim was a 41-year-old man who, according to the country's health ministry, also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from July 22, only five deaths had been reported, all in the African region.  The WHO last Saturday declared the rapidly spreading outbreak a global health emergency, its highest level of alert.  In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country.  Of the 3,750 patients on which it had information, 120 or 3.2 per cent had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said without providing further details.  The first death occurred in the northeastern Valencia region and the cause was encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain associated with the infection. Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes,  headaches  and muscle aches.  The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus.  Health bosses have also stressed it's important to check for symptoms of proctitis, anal or rectal pain or bleeding - especially if the individual has had a new sexual partner recently. New York in the US has declared a state disaster emergency to tackle the outbreak with more than 1,383 cases in the state. Brazil, along with the United States and Canada, is among the countries most affected by monkeypox in the Americas, where more than 5,000 cases have been reported to date, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).  The South American country reported 1,066 confirmed cases and 513 suspected cases of the disease, the vast majority (744) in Sao Paulo state, the Health Ministry said.  More than 98 per cent of the confirmed cases in the country are men who have sex with men, with an average age of 33 years, according to ministry data.  PAHO said in a press briefing this week that almost all cases had been reported among men who have sex with men between the ages of 25 and 45, but warned that anyone can get the disease regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.

First person in Europe dies after catching monkeypox since start of current outbreak,,2022-07-29 20:14:00,"Spain has reported its first  monkeypox -related death, the Spanish Health Ministry said. It is understood to be Europe's first known death and the second outside of Africa in the current outbreak. The five previous reported deaths were all in African nations. Spain’s Ministry of Health confirmed the fatality today as it revealed 4,298 cases have so far been notified. It gave no details about the person who had died and when it had happened. Only 64 of the  confirmed cases  in Spain have been women. Earlier this month when the number of confirmed cases stood at just over 3,000 in Spain, it was identified as the monkeypox world leader. The earliest cases in May were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria. Brazil also reported its first monkeypox death earlier on Friday. The man who died was described as a 41-year-old who also suffered from lymphoma and a weakened immune system. Last week the World Health Organisation declared monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. The organisation’s Director General Dr Tedros Adhanmon Ghebreyesus said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was ""high"". Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes,  headaches  and muscle aches. The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet. However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. Health bosses have also stressed it's important to check for symptoms of proctitis, anal or rectal pain or bleeding - especially if the individual has had a new sexual partner recently. These additional symptoms will help both individuals and clinical professionals identify monkeypox symptoms. However, the majority of people with monkeypox can safely manage their symptoms at home as there have been no deaths in the UK. Most people experience mild disease but it can cause a significant illness in some requiring hospitalisation for symptoms such as severe pain. Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at UKHSA, said: ""We continue to see new diagnoses of monkeypox, passed on primarily through close or sexual contact.

Monkeypox infections on the rise as Brits warned to check for rashes and blisters,Milica Cosic,2022-07-26 17:50:00,"British health officials say there are now 2,432 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, according to recent data. As of Monday July 25, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says of these, 65 infections have been classified as highly probable cases. The increase comes after there were only 2,208 confirmed cases in the UK as of Sunday 24 July. The UKHSA has published the latest epidemiological overview for the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.  The document states that in order to expand the UK’s capability to detect monkeypox cases, some  NHS  laboratories are now testing suspected monkeypox samples with an orthopox polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.  And since 25 July 2022, the monkeypox case definition recognises those who are orthopox-positive as highly probable cases. And those who test positive on a monkeypox PCR test have been classed as confirmed cases. Dr Sophia Makki, National Incident Director at UKHSA, has warned people to make sure they are aware of all symptoms, adding: ""Monkeypox cases continue to rise, with the virus being passed on predominantly in interconnected sexual networks. ""Before you have sex, go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician."" Speaking about the fact that the NHS is scaling up its monkeypox vaccination programme in London, Dr Makki said: ""Vaccination will further strengthen our monkeypox response and so we urge all those who are eligible for the vaccine to take it up when offered. ""It will help protect yourself and others you have had close contact with. While the infection is mild for many, it can cause severe symptoms and hospitalisation in some. ""Please remember that the vaccine may not provide complete protection against monkeypox, so it is still important to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and call 111 or a sexual health clinic if you develop any."" She continued: ""The NHS will provide the vaccine to those eligible, so please wait until you are contacted."" It is important to note that monkeypox can spread from person to person in different ways. The virus can spread though direct contact with the infectious rash and scabs, and through body fluids, including:  • Touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash   • Touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs (including during sex)   • The coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash  Monkeypox can occasionally be deadly, especially in places with inadequate health care. Although, over 99% of people who contract the disease are likely to survive. Though infections are generally mild - with illness from the virus typically lasting two to four weeks - the virus can be dangerous to certain people. Even if not fatal, symptoms of monkeypox can be quite painful. Some people have reported to be experiencing permanent scarring from the rash.

New monkeypox study warns virus has 'no borders’ as more symptoms detailed,Tim Hanlon,2022-07-22 06:02:00," New  monkeypox  symptoms have been revealed in a latest study while a lead scientist of the report has warned that the virus has ""no borders"".   A vaccination programme against monkeypox is being stepped up by the  NHS  as more supplies of a jab come on stream.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine as monkeypox cases continue to rise. As of July 18, there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. While anyone can get monkeypox, the majority of cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  Global outbreaks of monkeypox were noted in May and now  The New England Journal of Medicine  has published its findings after the largest review so far of the virus covering 16 countries.  It is known to cause flu-like symptoms and rashes with small spots which blister before scabbing over. But now other new symptoms have also been discovered. “These symptoms include single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. Statistically one in ten people had a single skin lesion in the genital area and 15% had anal or rectal pain said Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London. While Professor Chloe Orkin, of the same London university and Director of the SHARE collaborative warned about the spread of the virus. She said: “Viruses know no borders and monkeypox infections have now been described in 70 countries and in more than 13,000 people.” Vaccination experts have recommended that gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. While the vaccine is available across England, London will receive additional doses of the existing supply in an effort to break chains of transmission as quickly as possible. NHS England said thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted about getting their jab as plans are scaled up and more supply becomes available. The public should wait to be contacted about a vaccine. In London, there are more than 18 clinics offering vaccinations including Dean Street sexual health clinic in Soho, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Guy's Hospital in Southwark, Mortimer Market Centre in Camden and Barking Hospital Outpatient Centre East. Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: ""While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. ""On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible. ""The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice. ""Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful Covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected.

Monkeypox common questions answered - links to STIs and fatality rates,Malvika Padin,2022-08-06 09:00:00,"Monkeypox  is a viral infection coming from the same family as the smallpox virus, and has been spreading rapidly around the globe.  With two  deaths being confirmed in Europe , monkeypox  symptoms  tend to cause extreme pain and discomfort across many parts of the body, sometimes being severe enough to cause permanent scars on the skin as well as damage to the brain, eyes and lungs. The disease is also thought to pose more serious risk to vulnerable populations, such as children and the immunocompromised.  Monkeypox is a viral infection that was first discovered in monkeys in 1959 and in humans in the early 1970s.  The disease is typically self-limiting and should resolve itself with time.  Though it's quite similar to smallpox in terms of symptoms, monkeypox tends to be milder and less likely to cause death.  Common monkeypox symptoms include: The rashes often begin as flat lesions that become raised, looking similar to blisters or pimples.  These pustules are typically filled with fluid or pus. But there may be some  pseudo-pustules that don't have pus  but lead to ulcers. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection(STI), with Toronto-based infection control practitioner Erica Susky explaining that people are mislabelling the disease.  She said: ""The misconception is that it is a sexually transmitted infection, but close contacts of a non-sexual nature may also be a source of transmission. For example, close skin-to-skin contact, hugging, kissing, and close face-to-face contact.  ""All of these contacts may not be sexual in nature, though sexual contact is also an opportunity for viral transmission."" So, while monkeypox can spread sexually, it is not actually the primary mode of transmission. Instead, skin-to-skin contact is.  This contact may include: The West African type of monkeypox that is now spreading is rarely fatal, according to Dr Douglas Chiriboga of Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center. However, it can be deadly for certain sections of populations, including unvaccinated children and immunocompromised populations.  Research is currently being conducted to learn more about how to treat the disease and prevent serious complications.  There is currently no known cure for monkeypox, however some treatment may work. Some people who have obtained the drug Tecovirimat (brand name TPOXX) from the CDC have reported that it helped clear their rash faster and reduce their pain, according to Dr Jay Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response. Generally, even without any treatment or cure, monkeypox goes away on its own after two to four week.s  According to Dr Jay Varma, people receiving one of two available vaccines for smallpox seem to have effective protection against monkeypox.  This includes:  The vaccine is estimated to be around 85% effective at monkeypox prevention, however research on this is limited for now.  The vaccines are recommended for those who may have been exposed to monkeypox in the past four to 14 days, as well as those in occupations like laboratory work.  If someone has been infected with monkeypox, they are contagious until their rash has completely disappeared. This means that your blister or lesion from infection has scabbed over and fallen off, with new skin is now covering the area where the blister and scab were before.

Monkeypox 'set to be declared health emergency' as cases rise at alarming rate,Tim Hanlon,2022-07-28 01:56:00,"Monkeypox is set to be called a public health emergency in the coming days by the United States, it is reported.  It comes as the  World Health Organization  has said that there have been more than 18,000 cases of monkeypox reported globally from 78 countries, and with the majority in Europe.  The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency last Saturday.  Scientists advising the WHO on  monkeypox  say the window is closing to stop its spread, with cases currently doubling every two weeks, raising concerns that it will take several months for the outbreak to peak.  And the Department of Health and Human Services in the US is expected to also declare an emergency that would allow it to then receive more money and personnel to tackle the outbreak.  A decision could come by the end of the week, reported  Politico , citing two insiders with knowledge of the situation.  “I do think it deserves to be one,” reportedly said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We’re having a lot of challenges around the country with their rate of rise in terms of new cases. It isn’t an emergency posing a … high threat to the general population. But it’s still moving … and has the potential to spread to additional vulnerable communities.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did say on Wednesday it plans to make the rapidly spreading monkeypox disease a nationally notifiable condition. The designation, which is set to take effect on August 1 updates criteria for reporting of data on cases by states to the agency and would allow the agency to monitor and respond to monkeypox even after the current outbreak recedes, the CDC said. Over 3,500 monkeypox cases were reported in the United States as of Tuesday, according to the CDC. States will be required to report confirmed or probable monkeypox cases within 24 hours. The CDC asked for data to be shared even before the investigation of a case was completed. State health departments are currently not required to provide the federal government with standardized data on monkeypox. The disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, was declared a global health emergency by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in an unprecedented move after a majority of members of an expert committee voted against it. WHO Europe has forecast just over 27,000 monkeypox cases in 88 countries by August 2.

Holiday Brits warned over monkeypox outbreak as 100 cases confirmed in Canary Islands,Milica Cosic,2022-07-21 20:49:00," One hundred cases of  monkeypox  have been confirmed in the  Canary Islands  - which includes Gran Canaria,  Tenerife  and Fuerteventura.  The Ministry of Health  of the Government of the Canary Islands declared a health alert that there have been 96 confirmed cases, of which 65 were detected in Gran Canaria, 29 in Tenerife and two in Fuerteventura.   It has been reported by  El Dia  that all active cases are experiencing mild symptoms but are remaining in home isolation and receiving follow-up care.  Authorities are now trying to halt the outbreak that has exploded across the Islands, which are a tourist hotspot that attracts millions of visitors every year.  Meanwhile, the  World Health Organization  's emergency committee convened today to consider - for the second time within weeks - whether to declare monkeypox a global crisis.  Dr. Hugh Adler, who treats monkeypox patients in Britain said: “If reclassifying monkeypox as a global emergency will make (vaccines available), then maybe that’s what needs to be done. “But in an ideal world, we should be able to make the necessary interventions without the emergency declaration.” There are now more than 15,000 monkeypox cases worldwide, with United States, Britain, Canada and other countries buying vaccines against it. In the UK, the NHS is stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab come on stream. And in the US, officials have announced that more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses were being sent to states in the next few days. There are also plans of ordering several million more for the months ahead. Active cases have so far been detected in: Israel, Norway, Thailand, Australia, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.  Symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever and chickenpox-like blisters, which the  NHS  say the disease is often confused for.  One to five days after a person's symptoms appear, they may break out with a rash - often beginning on face before spreading to different parts of the patient's body. However, according to the health service, symptoms tend to clear between two to four weeks.

How does monkeypox spread and is it dangerous as virus declared global health emergency,Malvika Padin,2022-07-25 11:51:00,"Monkeypox  is not a new disease, having first been detected in humans in 1970.  However cases of the virus have been increasing throughout this year.  With more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox now being recorded in 75 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the expanding  outbreak of the virus as a global health emergency .  Symptoms of the monkeypox virus , which is part of the same family of viruses that causes smallpox, consists mainly of rashes or lesions appearing on different parts of the body.   Other symptoms include high fever,  headaches , muscle pain, chills, swollen lymph nodes and exhaustion.  But is dangerous and why has it been declared a global health emergency? Here’s what you need to know. Monkeypox can spread from person to person in different ways. The virus can spread though direct contact with the infectious rash and scabs, and through body fluids. It can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact, or during intimate physical contact like kissing, cuddling or sex. Among pregnant people, the virus can potentially spread to the foetus through the placenta. People can even catch monkeypox by touching items like clothing or bedding used by an infected person. It's possible for the disease to spread not just from person to person, but from infected animals as well. This can happen if you're scratched or bitten by an infected animal, or if you eat the meat or use products from an infected animal. Monkeypox can spread from the time symptoms start till the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed over the lesions. If a person doesn't have any symptoms of monkeypox, they cannot spread the virus to others. Monkeypox can occasionally be deadly, especially in places with inadequate health care. However, over 99% of people who contract the disease are likely to survive. Though infections are generally mild with illness from the virus typically lasting two to four weeks, the virus can be dangerous to certain people.  Those with weakened immune systems, those with a history of  eczema , people who are pregnant or breastfeeding as well as children under eight years of age are more likely to get seriously ill or die from the monkeypox virus.  Even if not fatal, symptoms of monkeypox can be quite painful, with people even experiencing permanent scarring from the rash. The WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared monkeypox a global health emergency. The classification is the highest alert that the WHO can issue and means the monkeypox outbreak is an ""extraordinary event"" that could spill over into more countries and requires a coordinated global response. The emergency declaration serves as a plea to get more global resources and attention to an outbreak. Mr Tedros said: ""In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulation.""  WHO has previously declared emergencies for public health crises like the  COVID-19  pandemic, West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak in Latin America.

Monkeypox and Chickenpox key differences – main symptoms and how to tell them apart,Ariane Sohrabi-Shiraz,2022-07-25 11:07:00," A  global health emergency has been declared  by the World Health Organisation (WHO) due to the spread of the monkeypox virus.  More than 70 countries are now experiencing an ""extraordinary situation"" due to the spread of the virus.  As the number of  monkeypox  cases in the UK continues to climb, it's important to be aware of the symptoms of it to avoid it spreading further.   According to the  NHS  the rash caused by monkeypox is sometimes consumed with  chickenpox , which is a common illness in young children.  It's important to know that there are several key differences between the two, so you know what steps should be taken further. It usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of monkeypox to appear. The first symptoms, according to the NHS, are: A rash will also usually appear after one to five days of the first symptom. This will often start on the face, before spreading to other parts of the body, including genitals and anus. The main symptom of chickenpox is an itchy, spotty rash which can appear anywhere on the body. This usually happens in three stages – first small spots appear, then the spots become blisters and then they become scabs. Other symptoms include a high temperature, aches and pains, generally feeling unwell and loss of appetite. The most important difference is that they are caused by difference viruses. Monkeypox comes from the orthopox virus, while chickenpox comes from the varicella zoster virus, which also causes shingles. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness which causes an itchy, spotty rash. It mostly affects children but you can get it at any age. As the monkeypox virus also causes a rash, it can sometimes be confused with chickenpox. According to the NHS, monkeypox rashes start as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These usually form scabs and then fall off. Both can be spread through direct contact with skin lesions and recently contaminated objects, or close contact due to respiratory droplets. GP and TV Personality Dr Nighat Arif has said that it is possible to tell the difference between the symptoms. For example, you might find your child's ""temperature will be higher with monkeypox, and they may complain of backache, lower leg aches, chills, and very tender glands around their neck”. She added that the “blisters are bigger [with monkeypox]. The chances of them having it are very slim if they haven’t travelled or been in close contact with someone who has."" You should call a GP if your child has a rash with blisters and has been in contact with someone who has or might have monkeypox, or has been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks. They should stay at home and avoid close contact with other people, including sharing towels or bedding. You should also call the GP surgery before going to visit. If you have, or suspect your child has chickenpox, the infected person needs to stay away from school, nursery or work until the spots have formed a scab. For chickenpox this is usually five days after the spots first appeared. You should always speak to your GP if you're not sure it's chickenpox, or if the skin around the blisters is hot, painful or red.

Man describes monkeypox battle as 'like someone is taking a potato peeler to your skin',Liam Buckler,2022-07-20 11:12:00," A man has described his 'traumatic' battle with  monkeypox  which 'literally feels like someone is taking a potato peeler to your skin'.   Luke Shannahan, from Texas, US, revealed he only knew he had been exposed to the virus when he was informed by the  Dallas Health Department  through a track and trace call.  Prior to being told he had monkeypox Luke had been attending pool parties, socialising with friends, and going to music gigs - with all close contacts now testing positive. This has meant Luke has been forced to isolate for the last three weeks and he has described the symptoms as “complete hell”. He told Houston’s KHOU 11: ""You have these blisters that are inflamed and anytime it grazes something or touches something. ""It literally feels like someone is taking a potato peeler to your skin. The entire pain was just constant.""  Luke believes the monkeypox symptoms are ""100 times worse” than  Covid  symptoms, which he contacted last summer.  Although Luke's had a monkeypox vaccination he has warned of the horrendous whole body rashes which blistered and caused him immense pain - along with swollen lymph nodes. He admitted: “It’s the most traumatic experience I’ve ever had. It’s the worst sick I’ve ever been.” The virus, which can spread through bodily fluids and through socialising with close contacts, has largely been spread among gay men up until now. However, it's been reported Texas just identified its first case in a woman. And Luke wants to raise awareness of the virus as it can affect everybody - not just gay men. “It definitely is something that we need to be paying attention to,"" he said. ""This is not just a gay illness, this is not something that just affects gay men that have sex with men. ""This is definitely something that can affect everybody.""

Monkeypox declared global health emergency by WHO after surge in cases,Dave Burke,2022-07-23 15:22:00,"The World Health Organisation has declared monkeypox a global health emergency. In a statement this afternoon WHO said the outbreak in more than 70 countries is an ""extraordinary"" situation that now qualifies as a global emergency. The UN health agency's declaration could spur further investment in treating the once-rare disease - and also worsen the scramble for scarce vaccines. Although monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere. The UK had detected just seven cases prior to 2022, but earlier this week there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. Declaring a global emergency means the monkeypox outbreak is an ""extraordinary event"" that could spill over into more countries and requires a coordinated global response. The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the  Covid-19  pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. The emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak.  Yesterday  The New England Journal of Medicine  published its findings after the largest review so far of the virus covering 16 countries.  It is known to cause flu-like symptoms and rashes with small spots which blister before scabbing over. But now other new symptoms have also been discovered. “These symptoms include single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said.

School sends children home over fear of outbreak following confirmed monkeypox case,Katie Weston,2022-07-15 07:51:00," A school has sent students home after a confirmed  monkeypox  case led to fears of an outbreak before the summer holidays.   Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School in Surbiton, South West  London , took advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to ask some pupils to leave the premises while contact tracing was underway.   The  school , for children aged 3 to 11, remains open but parents have been told to contact  NHS  111 if they notice any unusual blisters or rashes on their kid's body, reports  MyLondon .  A UKHSA spokesperson said: “We’re working with Kingston Council to provide public health advice to Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School following a confirmed case of monkeypox in the school community. “When cases of monkeypox are identified we rapidly investigate and carry out detailed contact tracing to assess who may have come into contact with them and what their contact was. “Following our risk assessment, the appropriate health information and advice is provided to the contacts so that they know symptoms to look out for and what action to take e.g. vaccination. “Any parents concerned about unusual rashes or blisters on any part of their child’s body should contact NHS 111, whilst adults can contact NHS111 or their local sexual health service. Both adults and children should avoid contact with others until they receive advice.” The health agency added that it was an ever-evolving situation and advice is under constant review.  It follows the World Health Organisation (WHO)  revealing last month  that two children in the UK have been infected with monkeypox.  The agency said it was investigating reports of infected children in Britain, as well as following up reports in Spain and France. None of the cases in children had been severe, the health authority said at the time. Between May 6 and July 11 this year, there have been 1,735 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, and 1,229 of these were Londoners, according to UKHSA figures. This compares with only seven cases recorded in the UK between 2018 and 2021.  London Mayor  Sadiq Khan  has said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the spread, and has written to the recently appointed Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, urging him to act.  This follows calls by health charities including the National Aids Trust and the Terrence Higgins Trust for the NHS and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) to combat the outbreak as soon as possible. On Thursday evening, Mr Khan said: ""Today, I have written to the Health Secretary over the growing number of monkeypox cases in London and the UK. ""London is currently seeing the highest rate of infection and I'm deeply concerned that reported monkeypox cases have doubled in less than a week.  ""If we have learned anything from the  Covid-19  pandemic, it's that early action and coordination is vital to get ahead of the curve. The Government must rapidly ensure that there's a coordinated and resourced approach to tackle the threat faced by monkeypox now.  ""I have let the Secretary of State know that City Hall will do everything it can to ensure Londoners have the information and support they need."" Most people affected by the virus during this year's outbreak have been men, at 99.4%, according to the UKHSA. For confirmed cases where gender information was available, 1,633 were men and only 10 women. Sexual health charities have warned that the increased burden to their services caused by monkeypox also risks jeopardising the Government's target of ending new HIV cases in the UK by 2030. Monkeypox is related to smallpox and cases are usually found in West and Central Africa, with the virus not often spreading elsewhere. The disease, which was first discovered in monkeys, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Most patients experience a fever, body aches, chills and fatigue, but some may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.

Monkeypox UK - can you get a PCR test for symptoms and where do you go?,Harry Thompson,2022-06-30 10:23:00,"Monkeypox  has fully arrived in the UK, with  1,076  cases having now been reported in the  British Isles  as of June 26 - 79% of which are in London.  Now, a new rapid 90-minute PCR test has been developed by a South Korean firm called Seegene, which will help with the detection and monitoring of the condition. However, at the time of writing, such rapid tests are yet to be rolled out, and longer, lab-based testing is required.  The disease, which is  mainly caught from infected rodents such as mice and rats , can according to the  NHS  be spread from person to person through “touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash"".  The NHS also warns against “touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs (including during sex)"" and avoiding the ""coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash"". Risk in the UK remains low, and people are only encouraged to encourage a clinic if “you've been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they've not been tested yet) in the past three weeks”, or “you've been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks”. PCR tests do now exist for the condition, but a series of steps need to be taken before you are able to take one.  Unlike with  Covid-19 , which adopted an increasingly informal approach to testing that saw countless results never even reported, the relatively smaller scale of monkeypox means that tests are carried out through far more clinical and official processes.  A PCR for monkeypox in the UK will only be taken when certain criteria have been met and particular experts consulted. Initially, cases must be brought to local infection clinicians such as infectious diseases, microbiology, virology or genitourinary medicine. After said consultations have been had, samples will be taken from patients “who clearly meet the possible or probable case definition”. In other cases, there may be a degree of uncertainty or urgency to the process. In this case these people will be seen by the local infection clinician, who in turn will discuss with the monkeypox clinical support line. This is a 24-hour-a-day helpline and is for emergencies only. From here decisions about testing and next steps will be made. According to the government website, the following steps are taken when sampling for monkeypox. Unlike how Covid tests swabs are taken, this time they are taken from an open sore suspected to be caused by monkeypox. The gov website says: “Ensure that the sample is definitely taken from a vesicle, an ulcer or a crusted vesicle. Rub the swab over the lesion and place the swab in the viral culture tube or viral transport medium.” The tests, which are done by medical professionals and not by the person who suspects they may have the condition, are then sent off. For high-risk patients who have come into contact with confirmed cases but do not themselves have any symptoms, a throat swab is taken.

Sexual health worker reveals horrific battle with monkeypox that left him in hospital,Sam Ormiston,2022-07-07 22:41:00," A man ended up in hospital for weeks with  monkeypox  after noticing horrific lesions on his face, days after mistaking his symptoms for long Covid.   Harun Tulunay first noticed that he was unwell when he was struck with a fever in the second week of June, after recently contracting  coronavirus .  But when his Covid test came back negative and his fever reached temperatures approaching 40C, the alarm bells started ringing.  Though most cases of the virus have been mild, the 35-year-old ended up needing urgent treatment in  hospital  - and was isolated in a room on his own.   Harun, who lives in Shoreditch, North London, was forced to cover himself in four blankets to keep his body warm while he was feeling chills - despite the rest of the capital being in the middle of a heatwave,  MyLondon reports .  With most of his friends still in Turkey, where he was born, Harun was battling high fevers, chills and painful swollen glands under his ears alone without his friends and family. He began to develop a red and white rash, which he passed off as a side effect of the high fever he was suffering. It wasn't until he checked a mirror after two days of being incredibly ill that he spotted the small lesion on his nose. Harun, a public speaker and advocate at sexual health charity Positively UK, said: ""I was unable to sleep and I was burning up with fever 38 degrees Celsius. The rash started out as red and white, I didn't have any blisters or anything. ""A couple of days later when I checked myself in the mirror, I noticed a little lesion on my nose but I didn't give much thought to it and had no idea it could be monkeypox. ""I thought it was acne or something."" Working in sexual health, Harun was well-versed in monkeypox and its symptoms but as he had not seen the same kind of rash or lesions most commonly associated with the disease, it didn't occur to him that he could have caught it. Unsure what was happening to his body, it was a scary time for Harun who just wanted to know what could be done to help him begin to feel better again. He said: ""When my fever and pain hadn't changed for a whole week, my friends became really concerned and so I reached out to 111 for help. I called five or six times when my fever was high and each time I told them the symptoms I was experiencing. ""At this point my fever was so high I was passing out and couldn't move. I would get asked the same questions over and over again - the answers were always the same. ""They said 'if you get worse call us' and each time I got worse the next day and when I called them the response was the same. My diagnosis was delayed a lot because of this, but I don't blame them."" Harun was referred to his GP after his condition continued to worsen. He had been diagnosed with HIV back in 2016 and there was initial concern that his HIV medication, which means that he can live with the virus and not transmit HIV to anyone else, had stopped working. Harun was advised to get in touch with his sexual health clinic, and after explaining his symptoms as well as noticing the rash on his nose he was advised to be tested for monkeypox. He took an isolated route through the sexual health clinic as well as wearing a mask and covering up his lesions on his nose since it was still unclear what was making him unwell. When he was tested for monkeypox he said that ""they hadn't seen a case like his before"" and his ""symptoms were not the ones they had seen with other people."" Harun added: ""There are only one or two labs in London that can test for monkeypox and until you get a positive result there's nothing to be done. ""Because we know very little about this condition people are afraid of it. I went to the A&E and they didn't know what to do other than keep me isolated and gave me painkillers."" Harun was hospitalised after he became unable to swallow his own spit, eat food or drink liquids and as he was uncertain what was happening and living alone, it became overwhelming for him to deal with. He said: ""I just wanted to know what is happening to me and what action can we take, I didn't want to die from a high fever - my concern was not knowing what I had. ""After having been in A&E I was waiting on results from Homerton and I began to get worried about my fever. I'm completely alone in the UK, I don't have anyone with me. ""I was unable to swallow my spit, drink or eat and I cried to a nurse on the phone saying that I'm alone, even 999 doesn't listen to me, where can I get any help. A nurse then arranged for him to be sent to Royal London Hospital on June 24, where he received treatment. He added: ""I had the worst experience ever in the last few weeks, it was worse than Covid and I've had that twice. I wanted to share my story to educate people and normalise the conversation around monkeypox. My case is really rare - the person who transmitted this to me had it really mild - he had some legions but he wasn't as ill as I was. ""The lesion was so big and scary I was crying thinking it was going to leave a scar, it is scary waking up in the night alone shivering and being alone in an isolated room not knowing if the drugs they are giving you will work or when your lesion will disappear. ""I don't have anyone in London really, it was really upsetting and you feel lonely, they are asking you questions like 'do you have a will' - ask everyone If I'm going to die I don't have anyone right now and that played games with my mind."" Harun moved to London alone in 2015 to escape discrimination and the hostile environment he faced back home as a gay man in Turkey. He delivers public speeches and shares his life experiences to tackle stigma and raise awareness of HIV and mental health. He added: ""People out there still think that this is a gay disease and it absolutely isn't an illness that exclusively affects gay people. It's annoying that people are saying this is a gay disease - people commented on my tweets saying that 'oh you're gay, next time use a condom' and all sorts of ridiculous statements that just aren't true.  ""I want to make one thing clear, I've not shared my story to to tell people that they'll become like me if they catch monkeypox, my case is really rare - I want to tell people to watch out for the symptoms and be sensible. If you have a fever, swollen gland or  sore throat , stay at home, if you have blisters call your sexual health clinic.  My mental health has been messed up, all this uncertainty felt like the first days of Covid. ""People were really agitated and anxious then and that's how I felt. I've been in a room that no one can come in or out unless it's urgent. Only four walls and a TV channel with five or six channels. I just want to be in my own bed, my own home.""  When he arrives back home after being discharged from hospital, he is most looking forward to a shower, a catch up on the  Netflix  shows I've missed watching and get on the PlayStation because I love gaming.""

"UK Monkeypox cases pass 1,000 mark after 18% rise in last four days",Sam Elliott-Gibbs,2022-06-28 15:36:00,"Monkeypox  cases have hit hit 1,076 in the UK as the worrying increase continues. Cases are up from 910 on Friday, it has been confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency. Latest figures show 1,035 cases in England, five in Northern Ireland, 27 in Scotland and nine in Wales. Almost 90 per cent, 659, cases reported a home address in London. The South East and North West have the next highest figures. The Agency, which will be publishing updates twice weekly, said it expects to confirm more cases in the coming days. Dr Sophia Makki, Incident director at UKHSA, said: “The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.  ""We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. ""If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on. ""Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.  ""We are grateful to all the people who have come forward so far for testing and to assist us with our contact tracing.” The virus, which was first found in humans back in 1970, has been detected in 35 countries where it is not endemic in the past month. Monkeypox  has been linked to 66 deaths in Central and West Africa , where it is classified as endemic, since the start of the year. Scientists say it mainly spreads between people through direct, skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. Guidance issued by the UKHSA urges people to try and eat and sleep in a different room from those they live with if possible.

Health chiefs warn monkeypox now infecting children - 8 symptoms to look out for,Kelly-Ann Mills,2022-06-30 15:13:00," Two children in the UK have been infected with  monkeypox , the World Health Organisation has revealed, as Brits are warned about what to look out for in their youngsters.   ""Sustained transmission"" of the virus across the world could see it begin to move into high-risk groups, such as pregnant   women, immunocompromised people and children.   The  WHO  said on Wednesday it was investigating reports of infected children in Britain, as well as following up reports in Spain and France.  None of the cases in children have been severe, the health authority said. The virus has now been identified in more than 50 new countries outside the countries in Africa where it is endemic. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters: ""I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest that the virus (is) establishing itself and it could move into high risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women.""  There have been more than 3,400 cases of monkeypox, and one death, since the outbreak began in May, largely in Europe among   men who have sex with men, according to a WHO figures.  There have also been more than 1,500 cases and 66 deaths in countries this year where it more usually spreads. Last week, the WHO ruled that the outbreak did not yet represent a public health emergency, its highest level of alert. However, Mr Ghebreyesus said the WHO was tracking the outbreak closely and would reconvene the committee ""as soon as possible"" to assess whether this was still the case. The agency said it was also working on a mechanism to distribute vaccines more equitably, after countries including Britain and the United States suggested they were willing to share their stockpiled smallpox vaccines, which also protect against monkeypox. Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This ""incubation period"" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss.

British Airways crew in isolation after one tests positive for monkeypox,Adam May,2022-06-22 09:33:00," A British Airways crew has been put in isolation after one of them is understood to have caught  monkeypox .  Two pilots and nine stewards and stewardesses have all been placed in quarantine for 21 days in Singapore, it has been reported.  The flight is understood to be on  British Airways'  London to Sydney route, which goes via Singapore, and it's thought the positive test came when the crew were returning to the UK.  Health officials reportedly detected the infection in a steward once staff were tested after landing on Sunday evening.  It comes as  793 cases of monkeypox cases have now been confirmed in the UK. Authorities on Tuesday disclosed the case, saying the 42-year-old man had flown in and out of the city state in mid-June. The infection is the first recorded case of monkeypox in South-East Asia linked to the recent global outbreak. A total of more than 2,100 cases have thus far been detected across 42 countries since May. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 80 per cent of cases have been found in Europe, but the disease has also spread to North America, South America and Australia. The WHO has recorded one death in this outbreak.  A British Airways insider told the  MailOnline  : ""One of them had it, so they impounded the whole crew. Now they have got to spend 21 days in quarantine.  ""Everyone has been told not to talk about it – but it's all everyone is talking about."" A BA spokesperson told The Mirror: ""We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require. ""We’re in contact with our crew and providing the necessary support."" They added that the safety and security of its customers and crew is always its top priority and the risk to others on board is very low.  Meanwhile,  some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine Imvanex,  the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.  Smallpox is in the same virus “family” as monkeypox. There is currently no vaccine licensed in the UK or Europe for immunisation against monkeypox. As monkeypox is related to the virus which causes smallpox, vaccines developed for smallpox are considered to provide “cross-protection” against monkeypox. The UKHSA said the smallpox vaccine “is shown to be effective against monkeypox"" but shouldn't be offered out to everyone. It will only be offered to certain gay and bisexual men. Eligibility criteria is likely to depend on a person’s sexual activity. The UKHSA guidance states that a medic may advise vaccination for someone who “has multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends ‘sex on premises’ venues”.  Between May 6 and June 20,  793 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK. Of these, 18 were in Scotland, three were in Northern Ireland, six were in Wales and 766 were in England. Just five cases have been confirmed among women.  The majority of cases are among people in  London - but cases have been found in other regions too.  Symptoms include new and unusual spots, ulcers or blisters anywhere on the body, fever,  headaches , muscle aches, chills, fatigue and swollen glands.  Most people have a mild illness, with recovery within three weeks. But in some cases, severe illness can occur and sometimes results in death. The virus is not currently defined as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close and intimate contact that occurs during sex. Spread of monkeypox can occur when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal or an infected human. It may also occur when a person comes into close contact with material contaminated with the virus such as bedding. Anyone can get monkeypox but the latest cases have been mainly linked to “sexual networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men”, the UKHSA said.

Monkeypox could infect children by the end of the year - with vaccines set to roll out,Antony Thrower,2022-07-17 13:46:00," Experts say children could be infected with  monkeypox  by the end of the year, with fears the virus could be deadly to the youngsters.   Earlier this week  a class of schoolchildren were sent home , ending their lessons for the year early, when they came into contact with someone with the condition.  The close call has raised concerns monkeypox could spread to youngsters by 2023 to whom it could prove fatal. Grand Avenue Primary and Nursery School in Surbiton south London told parents in a letter as a precautionary measure they were closing reception two weeks early. My London  reported the school saying: “The whole of the Reception team and the School leadership are devastated that the end of this academic year is having to finish this way for the children.”  Parents were advised to avoid close contact with their children and to look for symptoms until the end of the month. Latest figures by the UK Health Safety Authority on Thursday confirmed on July 14 there were 1,856 confirmed cases in the UK with 1,778 in England. The vast majority (1,313) were residents in London, with 99.4% males. It comes amid calls for an increase in the number of vaccinations to protect against the threat. The Mail on Sunday  reported 50,000 doses are on order, but more will be needed.  Dr Deborah Birx, the former head of the US Covid task force, told the publication all gay men under 50 in London need to be protected. She added: “If you're at a gay bar and you're dancing, then there is a risk of infection.” Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, earlier said: “While anyone can catch monkeypox, the majority of monkeypox cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), with the infection being passed on mainly through close contact between people in interconnected sexual networks. “Before you go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. “If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician. “It can take up to three weeks for symptoms to appear after being in contact with someone with monkeypox, so stay alert for symptoms after you have skin to skin or sexual contact with someone new.” No deaths from monkeypox have been reported in the UK since the outbreak began earlier this year.

Man turned into 'walking zombie' after catching monkeypox following sauna visit,Katie Weston,2022-07-21 07:57:00," A man has told how he felt like a ""walking zombie"" after catching  monkeypox  and nearly collapsing at work.   Wesley Williams, 34,  became unwell  one day after visiting a sauna on a trip to London but initially thought it was just tiredness.   He broke out in spots 30 minutes into his shift as a waiter at Cheshire Oaks shopping centre and struggled to stand up while serving customers, reports the  Liverpool Echo .  Wesley said: ""I was completely shattered. I was so knackered I couldn’t stand up properly. I was a walking zombie and I really could not move. I had to sit down to take food orders."" He was sent home to get tested immediately after jokingly suggesting to his manager that he had monkeypox. Wesley continued: ""I thought I was just tired from London so I didn’t say anything straight away. It was my first day back from the trip and within the first hour, I literally nearly collapsed outside. ""The day after I wasn’t tired at all. I was feeling fine but I had started to see some spots appearing around my body. ""I didn’t think anything of it. I joked in work and said ‘maybe I’ve got monkeypox' but my manager sent me home to get tested straight away."" He tested positive for monkeypox, which he believes he caught at the sauna, after having swabs taken of his spots in Chester. For one week, Wesley's body was covered in small lumps and could only eat soup because he had strep throat. The lumps turned into rashes with blisters by the second week, spreading across his chest and thighs before starting to heal after 16 days. Wesley self-isolated for three weeks and was not provided any medication. He said: ""Monkeypox drained me more than Covid. When I had Covid it felt like the sniffly flu to me."" His comments come after figures by the UK Health Safety Authority confirmed there were 1,856 confirmed cases in the UK with 1,778 in England, as of July 14.

Monkeypox symptoms other than rash as study finds links to other STIs,Jessica Knibbs,2022-07-12 15:24:00," The global  monkeypox  outbreak has risen to 7,600 cases in more than 50 countries.  As of July 8, the UK reported 1,552 confirmed cases, including 1,482 in England, 41 in Scotland, 11 in Northern Ireland and 18 in Wales. The current strain of the monkepox virus  circulating around the world is mutating at a pace faster than expected.  Scientists warn it may have been circulating since 2018 and has mutated 12 times as much as it should have since then. Monkeypox cases numbers are also expected to rise this summer as populations mix at festivals and nightclubs around Europe and the UK. With this in mind, being aware of the early warning signs of the virus is integral. Historically, human monkeypox virus cases in the UK have been limited to imported infections from west Africa. Currently, the UK and several other countries are reporting a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics. In a study  published in the Lancet, symptoms and clinical characteristics of monkeypox virus cases in individuals attending a sexual health centre in London were further investigated.  In the study, patients with confirmed monkeypox virus infection via PCR detection attending open-access sexual health clinics in London between May 14 and May 25 2022 were analysed. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed in 54 individuals, all identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM), with a median age of 41 years. The study found that 38 (70%) of 54 individuals were white, 26 (48%) were born in the UK, and 13 (24%) were living with HIV. One in four patients had a concurrent STI. According to the study, unusual symptoms of monkeypox may include:  According to the  NHS , it takes about five to 21 days for the first monkeypox signs to appear.  When it comes to the characteristic rash, it usually crops up between one to five days after the initial symptoms. The rash might often begin on your face, spreading to other parts of the body as well as your genitals. Being similar to chickenpox, the rash starts with raised spots which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually fall off. Monkeypox usually does not require intervention or treatment, with most people remaining in isolation during their illness. The disease spreads via bodily fluids, including liquid from ruptured pox, blood and mucus. Mild infections should subside after a few weeks without treatment, but severe cases may warrant intervention like hospitalisation.

'The Undeclared War might be to much after Covid but it's bingeable for the die-hards',Sara Wallis,2022-07-02 17:50:00," If you needed something else to worry about because Covid,  Monkeypox  and the rising cost of your supermarket shop wasn’t enough – then there’s good news.   A  cyber attack  is imminent.  Peter Kosminsky’s latest series The Undeclared War, which started on C4 on Thursday, is set in an all-too-plausible 2024. A near future where more bad stuff happens, such as the entire country being brought to its knees by a terrorist hacker. I’ll just add this to my long list of anxieties, above “buy gifts for school teachers” and below “death of the planet”. The six-part thriller is set deep inside Government Communications Headquarters, where many, many tech nerds secretly analyse code to block cyber attacks. Super-bright graduate Saara Parvin (Hannah Khalique-Brown) begins her work experience at GCHQ, on the same day that a routine stress test suddenly takes down half of the UK’s infrastructure. It’s not clear what’s happening but boss Danny (Simon Pegg being unnaturally serious) looks extremely frazzled. Online banking is down, online shopping is down, no Zoom, no Teams but, strangely, social media is unaffected and it just so happens to be in the run-up to an election. Cyber attack. It’s Russia, right? No one seems sure. The Prime Minister Andrew Makinde (Adrian Lester), who has recently ousted Boris Johnson from leadership, is mostly worried about his unpopularity. Which is mostly because he’s deeply unpleasant. Now the analysts have to crack the code, fast. And Kosminsky has a clever trick so that we don’t spend six hours watching analysts stare at screens. Slick sequences go all Mission Impossible as we visualise what Saara is thinking. Suddenly she’s climbing an imaginary ladder, bouncing an imaginary ball against an imaginary brick wall, opening imaginary locks, a tool belt ready around her waist. It’s clever and engaging, because code otherwise would be boring. Much to the annoyance of all the middle-aged white men in the room, Saara, young, female and Muslim, is the one to spot the virus within the virus. She even gets a round of applause at a COBRA meeting (in the real world, someone else would take the credit), before bigwigs realise she’s just made everyone look incompetent. There is more work to be done to avoid complete disaster. Side plots, including Saara’s father’s suicide and a frisson of a lesbian love ­interest, lend some emotion to this ­otherwise robotic workplace.

Monkeypox vaccine will be offered to gay and bisexual men in the UK,Alice Peacock,2022-06-21 17:13:00," Gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to  monkeypox  will be offered a vaccine to help control the recent outbreak of the virus.   It comes as the number of monkeypox cases in the UK has  risen by 219 , with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) having confirmed on Tuesday that the total number of confirmed cases now stands at 793.  Now, a new vaccination strategy published by the agency recommends offering the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, to men considered to be at higher risk of exposure. Imvanex has been shown to be effective against monkeypox. While anyone can contract monkeypox, data from the latest outbreak shows higher levels of transmission within, but not exclusive to, the sexual networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Though the virus is not currently defined as a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed on by close and intimate contact that occurs during sex. The UKHSA strategy has been endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which was consulted on the eligibility criteria for the vaccine. The eligibility criteria would be similar to that used to assess those eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - however would be applied regardless of HIV status. A clinician may advise vaccination for someone who, for example, has multiple partners or attends ‘sex on premises’ venues.  Details on how eligible people can get vaccinated would be set out by the  NHS  in due course, with the health body advising people not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted.  Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: “Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. “Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. “In the meantime, everyone should continue to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they’ve had close contact with a new partner. If you think you have these symptoms, avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre, though please phone ahead before attending.” Robbie de Santos, Director of Communications and External Affairs at Stonewall said while anyone can watch the virus, the group welcomed the vaccine being offered to those gay and bi men who were currently at a higher risk. “It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others,"" he added. ""Let’s help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season.” London remains the epicentre of England's monkeypox outbreak, latest figures show, with 498 infections linked to the capital. The South East and North West have the next highest figures. So far 99 per cent of those diagnosed with the virus are male, with just five confirmed female cases, the UKHSA said in its latest daily update. The number of confirmed cases by region are: The agency said the location of 142 cases is still under investigation. In this afternoon's update the UKHSA said: ""Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. ""The outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries."" The virus, which was first found in humans back in 1970, has been detected in 35 countries where it is not endemic in the past month.  Monkeypox  has been linked to 66 deaths in Central and West Africa , where it is classified as endemic, since the start of the year.  Scientists say it mainly spreads between people through direct, skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. It can also be spread via contaminated objects such as linen and soft furnishings. Guidance issued by the UKHSA urges people to try and eat and sleep in a different room from those they live with if possible. It says: ""Where the use of a separate room isn’t possible, cases should avoid physical contact and keep at least 3 steps (1 metre) away from all household members. ""It is particularly important that they avoid close contact with young children, pregnant women and immunosuppressed people as they may be at higher risk of serious illness.""

Why is it called monkeypox as scientists set to rename virus over racist connotations,Malvika Padin,2022-06-15 12:35:00," As  monkeypox  cases continue to rise, with around confirmed 1,600 cases recorded globally in the last two months, scientists are looking for a new name for the virus.   Caused by the monkeypox virus, which is a less severe member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, monkeypox causes a rash that looks similar to  chickenpox.  It's thought it spreads when someone is in close contact with an infected person, with warnings issued  against having sex while suffering monkeypox symptoms. Previously confined to parts of Africa where rodents - not monkeys - were the main animal host, the virus has been spreading around the world.  Here's why the virus was named monkeypox in the first place and why experts want to change the name.  According to the CDC, monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when there were two outbreaks of the pox-like disease among colonies of monkeys kept for research, which is where the name ""monkeypox"" came from.  Though it was first discovered in monkeys, the natural host of the virus remains unknown. However, African rodents and non-human primates - like monkeys - are the most common hosts that carry the virus and infect people. The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), during a time when efforts were being made to eliminate smallpox. Since then, the disease has been reported in several other central and western African countries, though it has now spread to other countries around the world. Experts have expressed the urgent need to find another name for monkeypox virus, to prevent stigma and discrimination towards the disease and its causes. This is because continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, according to more than 30 scientists who are calling for the name change. The current name also doesn't fit the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines that recommend avoiding geographic regions and animal names. According to a WHO representative, discussions between the health agency and scientists over the new name are ongoing, with the aim to find a name that doesn't offend ""any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic group"". One name that's been suggested by scientists is hMPXV, however WHO has not yet confirmed their thoughts on this name. Monkeypox infections have mostly been found to be mild with risk to the general population being low. However, the virus has now spread to 32 countries, with 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and four in Wales, as of Sunday June 12. Though there haven't been any deaths in any of the newly affected countries, including the UK, there have been 72 deaths in countries where monkeypox is already an endemic. The WHO is set to hold an emergency meeting in the next week to discuss whether to classify the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, which is the highest alarm they can sound on a disease. Previous diseases that have been classed this way are swine flu, polio, ebola, zika and Covid. World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning. For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.""

Monkeypox cases soar past 500 in UK as Brits warned to check for rash,Katie Weston,2022-06-15 12:42:00,"Monkeypox  cases have soared past 500 in the UK with Britons being warned to check for a rash. The UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA) today said it has detected 52 additional cases of monkeypox in England, one additional case in Scotland and one in Wales. This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 524 as of June 14. There are currently 504 confirmed cases in England, 13 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and five in Wales. Last week health chiefs issued new isolation guidance including social distancing - urging those with the virus to sleep in separate beds and stay at least one metre apart from those they live with. The UKHSA said: ""Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.""  Anyone who has a rash with blisters is advised to contact a sexual health clinic if they have also had close contact with someone who has or might have had monkeypox in the past three weeks, or if they have travelled to West or Central Africa within that timeframe. Scientists say monkeypox mainly spreads between people through direct, skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. It can also be spread via contaminated objects such as linen and soft furnishings. Guidance issued by the UKHSA urges people to try and eat and sleep in a different room from those they live with if possible.

""It is particularly important that they avoid close contact with young children, pregnant women and immunosuppressed people as they may be at higher risk of serious illness."" Those diagnosed with monkeypox and highest-risk contacts should isolate at home,  the guidance  adds. The latest figures come as World Health Organisation's Europe director Dr Hans Kluge says the magnitude of the outbreak ""poses a real risk"". He told the briefing: ""The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach and the stronger the disease's foothold will get in non-endemic countries. ""Governments, health partners and civil society need to act with urgency... to control this outbreak."" According to WHO, monkeypox transmission is being driven by skin-to-skin contact and skin-to-mouth contact, and there is no evidence of a change in the virus. WHO said some 1,160 confirmed cases have been reported in 22 countries in the European Economic Area.  Most cases are mild but WHO said it had seen some complications, and some admissions to hospital.

"Monkeypox should be 'urgently' renamed over racist links, health bosses say",Dave Burke,2022-06-14 13:59:00," Global health chiefs are considering renaming  monkeypox  amid concerns over stigma and racism.   Officials at the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) are weighing up new names after a respected group of scientists called for it to be ""urgently"" changed.  The virus has swept across the world in the past month, having previously been classified as endemic in parts of central and west Africa. But experts have raised doubts about how widely it had been in circulation around the world, due to lack of testing. There have been 470 confirmed infections in the UK this year - compared to just seven prior to 2022.  In an  open letter  last week 30 international scientists said branding the virus 'monkeypox' is both discriminatory and inaccurate.  They objected to the labelling of the virus having originated in Africa, stating: ""Like many previous geographic labels of infectious diseases based on locations of first detection, it is misleading and inaccurate because very limited surveillance and limited diagnostic capacity means that the full range of the pathogen is not known. ""This is crucially demonstrated by the discovery in May 2022 that MPXV has been circulating in over 44 countries without detection and is likely to be present in many more."" The letter said identifying monkeypox as an African virus is both ""discriminatory and stigmatizing"" - and said a new way of referring to the disease in widespread circulation is needed. Calling for a new name, they wrote: ""Since viruses in this clade have been transmitting from person to person in dozens of countries and potentially over multiple years, we propose that this represents transmission route distinct from that of previous MPXV cases in humans and should be afforded a distinct name.... ""Whilst the formal naming of virus species is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we believe this is an opportunity for a break with the name monkeypox and the historical associations attached to that name. ""However, we believe that a distinct and convenient name for the virus causing this epidemic would facilitate communication without further negative connotations.""

Monkeypox: The areas in the UK with reported cases as infections edge closer to 600,Alice Peacock,2022-06-20 16:43:00," As the UK’s number of confirmed  monkeypox  cases soar well past 500, suspected cases of the disease have been reported in places as far apart as Maidstone, Bromley and Leicester.  As of Friday June 17, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had detected 46 additional cases of monkeypox in England, 3 additional cases in Scotland and 1 in Wales. This brought the total number confirmed in the UK to 574. Updated figures are not expected until Tuesday afternoon.  Since June 8, GPs and other doctors have been required to report any suspected cases of monkeypox they see, and laboratories must also report if the virus is identified in a laboratory sample,  Devon Live reports. This is because monkeypox was added to the list of notifiable diseases by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). These are infectious diseases, such as measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough, which have to be reported to local authorities or local Health Protection Teams. The figures for suspected cases reported locally are much lower than the number of cases confirmed by the UKHSA - meaning there may be more cases in these areas. Numbers may be lower because confirmed cases have not also been reported as suspected cases. In the week ending June 12, 12 cases were reported in England. That was on top of three cases the week before, two cases the week before that, and one case in the week ending May 22.   Week ending May 22   Maidstone   Week ending May 29   Northampton Tamworth   Week ending June 5   Leicester Newham Wycombe   Week ending June 12   Bromley Croydon Epping Forest Hammersmith and Fulham Middlesbrough Reigate and Banstead Sheffield South Tyneside Sutton Thurrock UA Wellingborough Wigan As of June 14, the UKHSA had confirmed 524 cases of monkeypox across the UK. There were 504 confirmed cases in England, 13 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and five in Wales. Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. People are advised to contact a sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and has been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks, or if they've been to West or Central Africa in the past three weeks.  The UKHSA is working with the  NHS  and the public health agencies of across the four nations to investigate the monkeypox outbreak in the past few weeks. As part of this it carried out analysis of the cases up to June 8, as well as anonymised detailed interviews with patients to try to understand transmission and to determine how to target interventions.  Of the cases interviewed, 81% were known to be London residents and 99% were male. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. Of the 152 cases that participated in more detailed questionnaires. In this data, 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same sex contact. Recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within Europe. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: ""We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments. We use the new data rapidly to inform the public health response and we continue to work to reduce transmission.

Monkeypox warning: Brits heading to Glastonbury urged to watch out for symptoms,Kieren Williams,2022-06-17 14:24:00," Health chiefs have issued a  monkeypox  warning for Brits heading to  Glastonbury  and other festivals to keep a wary eye out for symptoms as they enjoy themselves.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today reminded people heading to festivals and summer events to watch out for the virus. This came as they announced another 46 cases had been detected in England, along with three more in Scotland and another in Wales. As of yesterday, this brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 574. The body's warning comes ahead of next week's festival, one of the highlights of the music calendar. Health chiefs cautioned festival-goers to keep an eye out for the symptoms particularly if they have had multiple or new sexual partners. They said that anyone can catch monkeypox but it was particularly prevalent amongst men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men. The most prominent symptoms of the virus include a rash or blisters. Dr William Welfare, Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “As case numbers of monkeypox continue to rise and with many summer events and festivals ahead, we’re reminding people to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, particularly if you’ve recently had new or multiple sexual partners, to help prevent further spread and protect others. “If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. “Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. ""Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been seen by a clinician. “UKHSA is working closely with partners across the country, including event organisers and venues, to raise public awareness of monkeypox symptoms so everyone has a safe, happy and healthy summer.” England leads the way with the vast majority of the UK’s cases with 550 confirmed cases, Scotland has only 16 with six in Wales and two in Northern Ireland. The UKHSA advised the following people to contact a sexual health clinic: The virus is not a new one and has existed in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the 1970s but in recent months it made the leap to Europe and the west, causing alarm. So far, there have been no reported fatalities from the virus.

Blue Cross advice on monkeypox after patients warned to 'stay away from pets',Tim Hanlon,2022-06-08 15:13:00,"As monkeypox cases continue to rise in the UK, experts have been urging patients to stay away from their pets after testing positive.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned various species - including prairie  dogs , rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice and non-human primates - are susceptible to the  monkeypox  virus.  They have not yet ruled out whether domestic animals - such as cats and dogs - can contract the disease from humans or transmit it to them after picking it up from another animal. However, Blue Cross has confirmed there is currently no evidence of infections in dogs - but has issued guidance to pet owners as more research is undertaken.  According to the latest figures, The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 18 new cases of  monkeypox  in England, and one additional case in Scotland.     Sign up to our  TeamDogs newsletter  for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.    This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 321, as of June 7, with 305 in England, 11 in Scotland, three in Wales and two in Northern Ireland. Caroline Reay, Head of Veterinary Services at national pet charity Blue Cross, said: “Though there is no current evidence of infection in dogs, the situation is still evolving. “Until we know more, we would recommend that you wash your hands with soap and water before and after contact with your pet or any animal.” Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, backed the advice of people taking care with their pets.  ""It would be a sensible decision to keep your distance from a pet while in quarantine,’ she told the  Daily Mail. ""If I was diagnosed with monkeypox I would do whatever I could to limit contact, such as asking a friend or relative to take care of it."" She added: ‘There is currently no evidence of transmission between humans and cats and dogs but we know rabbits and rodents are susceptible.  The ECDC said it is important to: ""manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife"", reported the  Daily Record .  They warned that rodents could be effective hosts for the disease, and could spread the virus more effectively than humans. The announcement said: ""If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. ""Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. ""Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low."" Monkeypox is typically spread between people through physical contact, although it can also spread through contaminated foods, coughing or sneezing, and also contaminated animals.

Doctor's chickenpox advice to parents as cases rise - from symptoms to isolation,Sara Odeen-Isbister,2022-06-10 22:18:00," With parents concerned about a rise in  chickenpox , a doctor has offered some simple advice on how to deal with the common ailment.   Chicken pox affects almost all of us at some point in our lives. Though it is widely considered to be a relatively minor ailment,  Yorkshire Live  has reported that some parents in Yorkshire are worrying after hearing talk of an outbreak in the county.  Fears surrounding chicken pox are believed to have grown after a rise in the number of monkey pox infections, with some mistakenly thinking the two are linked. Data from Well Pharmacy last month showed the number of people vaccinated against chicken pox had risen 146 per cent in six weeks before. However, doctors have reassured parents that this chicken pox is nothing to worry about and can be safely handled at home. Now is the time to turn to your parents or grandparents' trusted tonic: calamine lotion. Retired GP, Dr Stuart Oliver, has offered some simple advice to help parents - and their suffering children - through this uncomfortable period. He said: ""If they've got a temperature, then it's Calpol, or just something to bring the temperature down. If it's particularly itchy, then tend to put calamine lotion on it, that's about it. ""Traditionally it's just about bringing down the high temperature with liquid paracetamol, Calpol is the best thing for children, and if it's particularly itchy then calamine lotion, otherwise just leave it."" This is advice that has been handed down through generations, but still holds true today: don't let them scratch! It can be so hard to stop your little ones from scratching, particularly when it seems to be the only way to get some relief from the agonising itch. But do try to employ the 'cruel to be kind' approach and stop them in their tracks. Many adults still have one or two scars that they can point to as the result of their childhood chickenpox, and the likelihood of the little spots scarring is greatly increased if a sufferer is permitted to scratch. So, make sure that you are on hand with the calamine lotion to help your kids feel more comfortable. Chickenpox, however, can be more harmful to adults or vulnerable people. Vulnerable people include people with autoimmune diseases, pregnant women and newborn babies. Anyone in these groups should seek medical attention if they suspect they have chickenpox.  However,  NHS  inform said: ""Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they've had it before.""

Monkeypox cases soar to 302 in UK as public told to look out for symptoms,Kelly-Ann Mills,2022-06-06 14:23:00,"Another 77 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed across the UK, with 73 in England, two in Scotland and two in Wales.  The UK Health Security Agency has said the total number of cases confirmed in the UK now stands at 302. There are currently 287 confirmed cases in England, 10 in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and three in Wales. The UKHSA said: ""Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms.  ""People who are gay or bisexual and men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected. ""Contact a sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters and you’ve been either: in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks to West or Central Africa in the past 3 weeks."" Last week the UKHSA released new guidance that advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately. They should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before partaking once more. The guidance comes because the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact, meaning sex could pose as a hotbed for spreading it. Last month Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  warned of rising cases but maintained that the vast majority were mild. He added that the UK was stocking up on further doses of vaccines that are effective against the virus. So far, there have been no reported fatalities from the virus. Speaking prior to the World Health Assembly in Geneva last Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event.

Monkeypox: Which countries have the most cases as virus linked to 66 deaths in Africa,Dave Burke,2022-06-08 14:28:00," The UK has the highest number of confirmed  monkeypox  cases among non-endemic countries, new data shows.   With 321 cases since last month, it has nearly a third of the 1,107 known infections outside Central and West Africa,  data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows .  Spain has the next highest with 198 lab-confirmed cases, while Portugal is the only other country to have had more than 100.  In countries where the virus has been most prevalent in the past, there have been 66 deaths thought to be linked to monkeypox since the start of the year,  the World Health Organisation (WHO) said .  In the past month 29 countries outside of Central and West Africa have reported at least one case of the virus, which was first discovered in humans in 1970. The vast majority of these cases are in Europe, while Canada, the USA, the United Arab Emirates and Australia have also reported outbreaks. In its most recent recent update, the WHO said the virus may have been spreading for some time without detection. The WHO said monkeypox is currently assessed as a ""moderate"" threat to global health. The virus has been endemic - meaning it is regularly found - in ten countries in Central and West Africa. Between January 1 and June 1 this year, there have been 1,408 suspected and 44 confirmed cases - including 66 deaths - in these countries, the WHO said. These countries are Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (identified in animals only), Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone. Scientists are scrambling to explain the reason for the worldwide outbreak. So far the majority of people found to have the virus have symptoms including genital and peri-anal lesions, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and pain when swallowing. The WHO says: ""This initial presentation of a genital or peri-anal rash in many cases suggests close physical contact as the likely route of transmission during sexual contact."" The number of cases in non-endemic countries since last month are:  The UK Health Security Agency,  which yesterday confirmed an additional 18 cases , has said that gay and bisexual men are ""disproportionately affected"".  It said: ""Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms."" There are currently 305 confirmed cases in England, 11 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 3 in Wales. Before 2022, there were just seven confirmed cases in the UK since the virus was first discovered. The WHO has said it is likely the true number of monkeypox cases is higher than official figures show. It said in its latest update: ""As epidemiological and laboratory information are still limited, the actual number of cases is likely an underestimate. ""This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection previously known to occur mostly in West and Central Africa, limited surveillance, and a lack of widely available diagnostics in some countries. ""Given the number of countries across several WHO regions reporting cases of monkeypox, it is highly likely that other countries will identify cases and there will be further spread of the virus.""

Monkeypox cases in each region as London records 70% of England's infections,Dave Burke,2022-06-02 05:50:00,"London is the epicentre of the UK's monkeypox outbreak, with nearly 70 per cent of cases reported in the capital so far, health chiefs have revealed. Yesterday the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed an additional six cases of the virus, which appears to be spreading from person to person. So far there been 188 monkeypox cases in England, of which 132 are in London. There are also five confirmed cases in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales, taking the UK total to 196. The UKHSA said 111 cases are known to be in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Only two cases are in women. It said: ""The current outbreak is the first time that the virus has been passed from person to person in England where travel links to an endemic country have not been identified."" Recent foreign travel to a number of European countries in the past three weeks has been reported by 34 confirmed cases - around 18 per cent of those affected up to this point. So far, the UKHSA has identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in Britain and abroad. ""Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified,"" the agency said. Kevin Fenton, London's regional director for public health, said: ""As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great."" The UKHSA is working with groups including the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV and the dating App Grindr to communicate with sexual health services and the GBMSM community. It is also encouraging the LGBT Consortium and Pride event organisers to help with messaging in the coming weeks. Monkeypox typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions that usually resolve on their own within weeks, but can kill a small fraction of those infected. UK health authorities are offering Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, Imvanex, to contacts of confirmed or suspected cases. Cases of monkeypox continue to rise outside Africa, mostly in Europe, and scientists are trying to pin down the reasons behind the spread. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said it had so far received reports of more than 550 confirmed cases of the viral disease from 30 countries outside of Africa.

'I've dodged Covid for years but caught monkeypox at superspreading Spanish sauna',Alahna Kindred,2022-06-08 12:07:00," One man who has managed to dodge testing positive for  Covid-19  has told of his experience contracting  monkeypox.  George, who is not using his real name, said he first noticed a black, scabby lesion and tried to  Google  his symptoms.  The 29-year-old said he feared it was a sexually transmitted infection as doctors were baffled when he went to a sexual health clinic. He says he wasn't getting any answers, despite his growing list of symptoms. George says he was fatigued, had horrible back pain and a ""nasty-looking"" black lesion had developed in his groin. He says he also had a spot-like sore break out over his right elbow, stomach and back. The healthcare worker says it was only caught when he went into a hopsital for a secondary throat infection.  He told  The Daily Telegraph  : ""[When I was in hospital] I got a call from the sexual health doctor who said, ‘I think this might be monkeypox’"".  “Suddenly everyone was in PPE and taking it incredibly seriously.”  George is on the first to speak publicly about contracting the virus after  James McFadzean came forward the UK's first patient. George tested positive for monkeypox on May 19 and stayed at the Royal Free Hospital in the infectious disease ward. He said: ""I feel like I managed to dodge Covid, but then suddenly I had monkeypox – at this point, there were, like, less than 10 people confirmed in the UK."" Describing his time during isolation, George said: ""It felt very much like a Covid situation. One flatmate had gloves, a mask, everything, and asked me to wear that too. It was stressing me out… I felt a lot of pressure to leave, unfortunately, and isolate somewhere else.” After three weeks, he was finally allowed to leave and said he had ""really missed the wind"" on his face. More than 300 Brits have so far been infected with monkeypox in what is the largest outbreak in any country outside of Africa. Monkeypox has now become a 'notifiable disease' in the UK, meaning doctors must tell local health authorities about suspected cases. Last week the UK Health Security Agency released new guidance that advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately. They should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before partaking once more. The guidance comes because the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact, meaning sex could pose as a hotbed for spreading it - but it is not an STI. Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This ""incubation period"" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss. George, who identifies as gay, says he believes he knows where he contracted monkeypox.  He said he and his friend went to Madrid at the beginning of May and went to a sauna that was later described as a  monkeypox superspreader event. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: ""Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox. ""This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. ""It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.""

Monkeypox cases hit 190 as infection spreads across UK - public asked to stay alert,Kieren Williams,2022-05-31 15:20:00,"The number of  monkeypox  cases in England has risen by 11 it was announced today, bringing the total amount of infections in the UK to 190. Just over three weeks since the first UK case was confirmed, the number has steadily increased since with  yesterday seeing the biggest increase in case numbers . The number of cases in England stands at 183, with four confirmed cases in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical advisor at UKHSA, said: ""The risk to the general public from monkeypox is still low, but it’s important that we work to limit the virus being passed on. We remind people that they should be alert to new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  ""If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person. ""UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days."" The first new monkeypox case was confirmed in the UK on May 7.  The virus has been considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo since it first appeared in the 1970s. In recent weeks, over 300 cases have been detected in Europe and the west, causing alarm in these countries. This comes after yesterday  health chiefs told monkeypox patients to stop having sex  to avoid spreading the virus. They said current evidence indicates it does not spread through genital fluids but physical contact. The UKHSA advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately and said sufferers should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before becoming sexually active again. They also recommend using a condom for eight weeks. Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation warned that the current case numbers could just represent the ""peak of the iceberg"". Speaking last week at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event.

UK's first monkeypox patient to go public slams 'farcical' contract tracers,Matthew Dresch,2022-06-07 22:31:00,"The UK's first  monkeypox  patient to go public claims it took almost two weeks for contact tracers to reach out to him.  James McFadzean, from London, said he suffered a fever, exhaustion and back pain after catching the rapidly-spreading infection. The 35-year-old added that the UK Health Security Agency only contacted him today - nearly two weeks after he was first diagnosed with monkeypox. The HR manager, who is gay, said he tested positive after calling up a sexual health clinic to discuss his symptoms. He told Mail Online he had slept with around 10 new partners in the run-up to falling ill. When he called the clinic, he was advised to take a monkeypox test, which came back positive, he told TalkTV.  More than 300 Brits have so far been infected with monkeypox in what is the largest outbreak in any country outside of Africa. James told Mail Online: ""It’s no wonder now we’re getting so many more infections if no contact tracing or awareness about you not needing the spots to have the virus being told to people ""No-one’s asked me who I’ve been in contact with. I was told that within 24 hours of my diagnosis someone from UKHSA would call me. ""I've called the clinic every day, asking 'why aren’t they calling me, I’m not allowed outside and not allowed to go work. The UKHSA is not calling me, someone needs to document this'.” James told TalkTV that the UKHSA only reached out to him after he went public with his story. He still does not know who he caught the infection from, although he thinks he caught it after returning to Britain from Dubai. Offering an update on his health, James told TalkTV: ""I actually feel much, much better now. It was very rough for the first week. But now I feel fit and well back to normal health. ""I really didn't think I had it. So, everything you hear everything you read talks about this tell-tale rash or lumps or pimples which I never had at any point of the illness. ""I fell ill much like a flu, fever, very exhausted back pain and on the calling local clinic they advised that I should go for a monkeypox test, which I was surprised by but I went along with it and get tested and I got that positive diagnosis.’"" Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.

That kind of seems farcical because every day I've been calling my clinic, the  NHS  Trust trying to get someone to get people to call me so we can do contract tracing so we can identify other people at risk. ""Because I was before the numbers started getting big so if they had trouble containing 50, 60, 70 cases, now they're getting into the hundreds. I can only imagine how long it's taking them to contact those people."" James added: ""It's not like we haven't just gone through a pandemic which is contagious and we've needed to contact people.  ""If you think, okay, the virus is different, but surely the infrastructure is there. As I said 50/ 60 people at the time I felt unwell. ""How many people just to take to call that many people, two people in a call centre.  ""So yeah, it's frustrating and the response they did to an article 'Oh, we've been trying to contact him non-stop' turned out to be untrue.  ""So just own the mistake.

Five deadly rash symptoms and how to tell them apart from harmless skin issues,,2022-06-06 14:07:00,"Our skin is the largest organ in the human body and it often works as an important early warning sign for a myriad of different conditions.  These dangerous illnesses cause imbalances in our  normal biological functions  which manifest as abnormal spots and rashes on our bodies.   Most rashes are completely harmless and can be treated with creams or antibiotics, but if they develop into certain pustules or swellings it could be essential that you seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms like this can signal often deadly illnesses such as  meningitis , leukaemia, and lymphoma.   With the UK seeing 207 identifiable cases of  monkeypox , a pox virus that causes a rash with pus-filled spots and lesions, paying attention to our skin's health is important. Being able to tell a harmless rash from a worrying rash can save you a lot of worry, as well as an unnecessary trip to your busy GP. This is how you can spot them.    Want to get the latest health news direct to your inbox? Sign up for the Mirror Health newsletter       HERE       Monkeypox is a viral infection originating in west Africa that has seen a resurgence in recent months, with the UK seeing the biggest global rise in identified cases of the disease. While initially contracted from poorly cooked wild meat, the pox virus can also be spread by physical contact with others. Symptomatic infections usually start with a fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. This then progresses into a rash that frequently appears on the face and spreads to other parts of the body.  Ifti Khan, Well Pharmacy superintendent explained to  The Sun  : ""There are several stages to monkeypox. The first developing into papules and fluid filled pustules before forming a scab and falling off. Monkeypox lesions appear and develop at the same time.""  Papules and pustules  - Papules are raised skin bumps, usually smaller than one centimetre. Pustules look similar, but with a white or yellow pus-filled tip.  Lesions  - As these ""fluid-filled pustiles"" pop, they leave behind damaged skin that will mark the body.   While Monkeypox poses little risk to healthy adults, pregnant women, children and the immunocompromised have been warned to be vigilant for the virus by the World Health Organisation. Those at risk from the illness are likely to be given a monkeypox vaccine by the  NHS .  Meningitis  is a dangerous infection that infects the tissue around the brain and spinal cord that can cause lifelong health issues and even death. While it is most common in children, the infection can also affect adults - especially the unvaccinated.  The most common variant of the disease in the UK is meningitis B, which is mostly spread through droplets when coughing, sneezing, or kissing. Sufferers are likely to first experience a high fever, a stiff neck and drowsiness - with many not developing a rash until the illness develops. The NHS says that this rash will have red or purple blotches, small pinprick spots and will not fade when a glass is rolled over it. If you or your child has a rash that does not disappear, call 999 immediately. Purpuric rash  - As the meningitis bacteria reproduce in the bloodstream, they release toxins which damage blood vessels and organs. The red and purple blotches that appear are areas where blood has begun to pool from this damaged tissue.  Petechial rash  - In contrast, the tiny red pinpricks characteristic of a meningitis infection are known as a petechial rash. They typically occur in areas where the body comes under pressure from items of clothing, such as at the waist or even the soles of the feet.  A positive diagnosis of the disease will result in a hospital stay and, if caught early, the disease has a high survival rate and can be treated with antibiotics. However, those infected can face blindness, deafness and the loss of limbs if the infection develops. Lymphatic cancer is when cancerous cells develop in the network of lymph cells and vessels in our bodies that help our body fight off bacteria and other infections. One of the most common forms of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is 'cutaneous T-cell lymphoma' - or skin lymphoma.  This is where infection-fighting lymphocytes in the skin become cancerous, rather than the skin cells themselves. The symptoms of this are known to resemble shaving rashes, with patches of red irritated skin affecting your limbs and neck, which will start to develop a white scale of skin and resemble  eczema .  Without treatment, lymphatic cancers can be deadly. Catching the early warning signs of a shaving-like rash and scaly skin. T-cell  - These ""white blood cells"" are part of the system of lymph nodes throughout the body that help fight disease.  Cutaneous  - Lymphatic cancers mostly affect the body's internal organs, with ""cutaneous"" indicating that this is cancer occurring in the body's largest organ - the skin.  Leukaemia is a cancer of the blood that originates in bone marrow and spreads into the bloodstream. As the cancer develops, the body's infection-fighting white blood cells and oxygen-carrying red blood cells become crowded out by abnormal leukaemia cells - with fever, fatigue, weight loss, rashes, and bruising the most common early signs of the disease.  As leukaemia damages blood vessels, a  purpuric rash  can develop, as blood pools under the skin resembling bruising. This happens as there are not enough platelets to block and clot damaged blood capillaries.  Inflamed blood vessels can also cause a petechial rash, with widespread tiny red and purple spots developing on the skin - alongside blotchy purple spots. Leukaemia can be both acute, meaning fast-developing, and chronic, meaning slow-developing. Spotting signs such as these rashes can be the only early indicator of the cancer, which is otherwise only picked up by routine blood tests or when the cancer has progressed further. Necrotising fasciitis is a bacterial infection that causes flesh to begin to rot and die off. Though infections are relatively rare, they can be caused by any minor cut that allows the necrotising bacteria into the body. The onset of symptoms are quick, with the affected area swelling and developing a dark purple rash. This then blackens and develops pus-filled blisters as the tissue begins to die.  Cases of necrotising fasciitis are frequently fatal, with 20 per cent of infections resulting in death. Within five days of infection, many of those afflicted will experience dangerously low  blood pressure  and a high fever.  Identifying the swelling and dark purple rash early are essential to getting the appropriate medical treatment, which can include surgery to remove the necrotic flesh before it spreads further. Our skin can be the canary in the coal mine when it comes to serious medical ailments in our own bodies. While most rashes are harmless, being able to spot an abnormal rash can make all the difference when it comes to early treatment of some serious illnesses. If you notice small red spots developing underneath the top layer of skin, it can be a sign that your blood is struggling to clot - meaning that your body is producing an abnormal amount of platelets. This could be an indicator for Hepatitis or HIV infections, as well as some genetic conditions. If your skin appears darker or thicker in some areas than others, it could be an indicator of cancer or diabetes. Known as acanthosis nigricans, these patches will be dry and with a different texture to the surrounding skin. Specifically for diabetes, this can occur on the neck, armpit, or groin and indicates that you have too much insulin in your blood. Some rashes can be as a result of a drug reaction. A rash that covers a widespread area is a typical reaction to many drugs, and can persist for weeks after taking them. It is important to inform your doctor if you experience a rash after taking new medication.

Monkeypox cases triple around the world with Europe at epicentre of outbreak,Will Maule,2022-06-06 00:46:00,"Cases of the monkeypox virus have tripled around the world - but the World Health Organisation (WHO) is confident that the spread does not merit a label of ""endemic"".  The WHO has said there were at least 780 cases of  monkeypox  discovered from May 13 to June 2 and currently assesses the global risk level as ""moderate"".  Globally, the UK has the highest number of new cases with 207 outside an endemic area, followed by Spain with 156 and Portugal with 138. Overall, most of the new cases are in Europe and North America as well as a handful in Mexico, Argentina, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Health experts have said the risk to the general public ""remains low,"" however, there is the chance that this risk could be heightened if the virus continues to spread in new countries.  The  WHO  warned that Europe remains ""at the epicentre of the largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported outside of endemic areas in western and central Africa"".    Get the news you want straight to your inbox.           Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here       The organisation said that the rapid transmission had been aided by the lifting of travel restrictions and warned that large in-person events over the summer could threaten to aid the spread of the virus. ""Rapid, amplified transmission has occurred in the context of the recent lifting of pandemic restrictions on international travel and events,"" the WHO explained. ""The potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is high. Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the Region. ""Over the coming months, many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur. ""But they also provide powerful opportunities to engage with young, sexually active and globally mobile persons to raise awareness and strengthen individual and community protection."" People who closely interact with someone who is infectious are at greater risk for infection, and this includes household members, sexual partners, and healthcare workers. There is speculation from health officials that the virus has been in circulation for longer than originally thought. Dr. Rosamund Lewis, the WHO's technical lead for monkeypox said: ""There may have been undetected transmission for a while. ""What we don't know is how long that may have been. We don't know if it's weeks, months, or possibly a couple of years."" The virus is spread through close contact, including contact with the skin rash of someone infected with the virus. It begins with symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion, before progressing to a rash which often appears on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. The distinguishing feature of monkeypox compared to smallpox is the swelling of lymph nodes. The illness typically lasts from two weeks to a month. The incubation period of the virus is between five and 21 days, at which points symptoms are likely to appear. The virus rarely kills healthy adults, according to the WHO. However, it can be dangerous to children, pregnant women and those who are immunocompromised.

Following on from the first UK case recorded earlier this month, on May 7, the number has since risen with hundreds of cases now known worldwide. Four of the UK's confirmed cases are in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland, one in Wales and the rest in England. The large jump in cases is due to no figures being reported over the weekend.  In light of the new cases announced by the UK  Health  Security Agency, they said: ""The risk to the UK population remains low, but we are asking people to be alert to any new rashes or lesions, which would appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body.   ""Although this advice applies to everyone, the majority of the cases identified to date have been among men who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these people in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner.   ""You should call  NHS  111 or a sexual health centre immediately if you have a rash with blisters and either:  ""You have been in close contact with someone who has or might have Monkeypox (even if they have not been tested yet) in the past 3 week. ""You have been to west or central Africa in the past 3 weeks, or you are a man who has sex with men."" The new cases come amid fresh guidance from UK health chiefs which advise anyone with monkeypox to abstain from sex. The UK Health Security Agency released new guidance today that advised any Brits with the virus to stop having sex immediately. They should wait until their lesions have healed and scabs have dried off, before partaking once more.. The guidance comes because the highest risk of transmission of the virus is through direct physical contact, meaning sex could pose as a hotbed for spreading it. May so far as seen over 300 suspected and confirmed cases of monkeypox in Europe. It comes amid warnings from the World health Organisation that the current number of cases could just be the “peak of the iceberg”.  Earlier this month, Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  warned of rising cases but maintained that the vast majority were mild.  Alongside that he said that the UK was stocking up on further doses of vaccines that are effective against the virus. Ahead of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, the UK's top health watchdog warned the public to take caution when taking part in celebration. Health bosses also issued a covid reminder to those heading to parties and using public transport. Monkeypox is not a new virus, and has long been found in central and western Africa. It has been considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo since it first appeared in the 1970s. So far, there have been no reported fatalities from the virus. Speaking prior to the weekend at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said. However, the expert added it is ""not a disease the general public should be worried about"". ""It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast."" In recent weeks, the virus has been identified in several countries across Britain and the west, including Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. The UKHSA says: “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals. ""The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.”  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: ""We anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with  NHS  services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals.  “We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. “Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. ""We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. “We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.""

UK monkeypox cases hit 106 as NHS 111 overloaded with calls from concerned Brits,Katie Weston,2022-05-27 15:20:00,"There have been 16 more monkeypox cases confirmed in England today bringing the total across the UK to 106. The new cases, as of May 26, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 101. There are also three confirmed cases in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as ""significant and concerning"". The body has issued symptoms to look out for and says the risk to the wider population remains low. On Thursday, the number of monkeypox cases rose by seven, while seven were reported the previous day.  The latest figures come as a health expert warns that  NHS  111 is being overloaded with calls from people with rashes who are worried they have the disease.  Mateo Prochazka, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), encouraged people to contact sexual health clinics instead to ease pressure on the non-emergency service, reports  The Telegraph .  The agency had earlier advised those with symptoms of the disease, such as a rash or swollen lymph nodes, to phone 111 or visit a nearby sexual health clinic. Mr Prochazka said during a webinar advertised on Grindr: “Anyone can be seen in a sexual health clinic regardless of gender, sexual orientation or identity. Everyone is welcome. “There are other potential routes of trying to get yourself into the system, maybe calling NHS 111, but this resource has been really overloaded with everyone calling who had a rash. ""We are trying to point people towards sexual health clinics.” UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days. UKHSA has also purchased over 20,000 additional doses of a safe smallpox vaccine called Imvanex (supplied by Bavarian Nordic) and this is being offered to identified close contacts of those diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at the UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body. If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” The virus is usually found in west and central Africa. Symptoms are generally mild and the illness is spread through close contact with someone already infected, and most people recover within a few weeks. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Meanwhile, a study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared. The research looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.”   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-monkeypox-cases-hit-27084679,The Mirror

Platinum Jubilee monkeypox warning - health chiefs issue advice 'stay vigilant',,2022-05-28 07:00:00," The UK's top health watchdog has issued a note of caution to people taking part in the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, as the number of monkeypox  cases hit 106  in less than three weeks. Health bosses also issued a  coronavirus  reminder for those planning to use public transport over the long weekend. The first national case of  monkeypox  was discovered May 7, with the following rapid increase in cases causing the UK Health Security Agency to issue a warning that the spread was "" significant and concerning "", with a particular note of caution for gay and bisexual men. Men who have sex with men have been identified by doctors as one of the ""notable"" groups among which the disease has spread. This growing infectious illness has  chickenpox-like symptoms , with painful red rashes as well as similar symptoms to flu or fever. While infections can last up to a month, the illness is usually mild and will pass without further treatment. Anyone who has pox symptoms like a rash or lesion is advised to contact 111 before heading into a GP's office or sexual health clinic. Want to get the latest health news direct to your inbox? Sign up for the Mirror Health newsletter  HERE Dr Charlotte Bigland, Consultant in Health Protection at UKHSA South West said: “While fewer people are wearing masks, it’s still advisable to wear one if you are indoors or if you are mixing with lots of people or on public transport.  ""Washing your hands frequently and ensuring you cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing can prevent the spread of  COVID-19 , as well as lots of other common infections. The best protection against COVID-19 is to get fully vaccinated.  “Monkeypox is also circulating nationally and internationally, so it’s important to for people to stay vigilant. There has been a notable number of cases identified among people who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact 111 or their local sexual health service for advice. If you think you might have Monkeypox, please phone ahead before attending a healthcare setting in person so we can ensure a good clinical experience.” Monkeypox is normally found in remote parts of central and west Africa near tropical rainforests. Monkeypox has eight symptoms which do not usually show up for at least five days. This ""incubation period"" could last up to 13 or 21 days before it is clear that the person has the monkeypox. The rash usually appears within the initial five days according to the NHS. In 95% of cases the rash affects the face, and in 75% it affects hands, according to the World Health Organisation. You can catch the monkeypox by touching the spots or scabs of someone infected or their clothes or bedding, and it can be passed on from sneezing and coughing. However, it is considered unlikely that the virus would be spread from one human to another. It is more likely that the virus would come from direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The disease usually lasts two to four weeks and people can get better without treatment. It can be dangerous if people develop secondary infections such as  sepsis , encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss.

Monkeypox patients warned to stop having sex and use condoms for eight weeks after virus,Kieren Williams,2022-05-30 18:29:00," Health chiefs have warned  monkeypox  patients to stop having sex amid concerns it could help spread the virus.  In fresh guidance released today, the UK’s top public health agencies called for new measures to manage transmission of the disease. This included telling anyone who has monkeypox to stop having sex whilst they have the virus. However, the health chiefs didn’t stop there and wanted Brits to continue to keep an eye on their sex life for up to eight weeks after, advising any patients to wear a condom over that period during any sexual activities.  The fresh guidance was agreed by the UK’s four public health agencies: the UK  Health  Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW) and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland (PHA).  They said: “Cases should abstain from sex during the period of early symptom onset and avoid contact with any lesions. “Whilst there is currently no available evidence of monkeypox in genital excretions, as a precaution, cases are advised to use condoms for 8 weeks after infection and this guidance will be updated as evidence emerges.” Prior to this, they stressed that monkeypox was spread through physical contact, especially through the sufferers lesions and scabs. They added: “People with monkeypox should avoid contact with other people until their lesions have healed and the scabs have dried off. “Cases can reduce the risk of transmission by following standard cleaning and disinfection methods and washing their own clothing and bed linen with standard detergents in a washing machine.” Alongside this, the health bosses said that as well as avoiding sex, people with monkeypox should isolate at home if they are well enough. This week, the UKHSA announced it has bought more than 20,000 doses of a smallpox vaccine that works against monkeypox. Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor and monkeypox Strategic Response Director, at UKHSA said: “This new monkeypox guidance sets out important measures for healthcare professionals and the public for managing the disease including how to safely isolate at home and reduce the risk to others.  “The highest risk of transmission is through direct contact with someone with monkeypox. The risk to the UK population remains low and anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service.”  This all comes after the World Health Organisation warned current case rates might only be the “peak of the iceberg”. Speaking prior to the weekend at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event.

"Monkeypox warning: Outbreak could be 'peak of the iceberg’, says WHO as cases hit 257",Ryan Merrifield,2022-05-30 09:28:00," The  monkeypox  outbreak could be the ""peak of the iceberg"" as 257 cases have been recorded worldwide, a  World Health Organisation  boss has warned.  Pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said there could be ""many more cases"" that have gone undetected in certain communities. The first UK cases were flagged up on May 7. WHO has now received reports of 257 confirmed cases and around 120 suspected ones across 23 countries, it said in an update on Sunday. There has been no reported fatalities so far. Speaking at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Friday, Ms Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities.   Have you contracted monkeypox? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk   “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event."" “We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said. However, the expert added it is ""not a disease the general public should worried about"". ""It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast."" As part of its update yesterday, WHO said the virus constitutes a ""moderate risk"" to overall public health, despite cases being reported in nations the disease is not typically found. It said: ""The public health risk could become high if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a human pathogen and spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease such as young children and immunosuppressed persons."" WHO also said that the sudden appearance of monkeypox at once in several non-endemic countries suggests undetected transmission for some time and recent amplifying events. The agency added that it expects more cases to be reported as surveillance in endemic and non-endemic countries expands. Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through measures such as self-isolation and hygiene. Most of the cases reported so far have been detected in the UK, Spain and Portugal. ""The vast majority of reported cases so far have no established travel links to an endemic area and have presented through primary care or sexual health services,"" the U.N. agency said.

Monkeypox 'won't lead to pandemic' but medics unsure how it's spreading,Graeme Murray,2022-05-30 17:27:00,"Medics from the World Health Organisation do not believe the monkeypox outbreak will lead to a pandemic - but are weighing up whether it should be classed as an emergency. The sudden rise in cases has baffled experts, who are unsure if infected people who are not displaying symptoms can transmit the disease. Monkeypox is usually mild illness that spreads through close contact and can cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions. More than 300 suspected and confirmed cases of the disease have been reported in May, mostly in Europe. The WHO is considering whether the outbreak, should be assessed as a ""potential public health emergency of international concern"" or PHEIC.  Such a declaration, as was done for  COVID-19  and Ebola, would help accelerate research and funding to contain the disease.  Rosamund Lewis, technical lead for monkeypox from the WHO Health Emergencies Programme was asked if it had the potential grow into pandemic. She said: ""We don't know but we don't think so. ""At the moment, we are not concerned of a global pandemic."" Once the disease has been contracted, the time between a rash emerging and scabs falling off is recognised as the infectious period. But there is limited information on whether there is any spread of the virus by people who are not symptomatic, Ms Lewis added. ""We really don't actually yet know whether there's a symptomatic transmission of monkeypox - the indications in the past have been that this is not a major feature - but this remains to be determined"", she said. The strain of virus implicated in the outbreak is understood to kill a small fraction of those infected, but no deaths have been reported so far. Most cases have cropped up in Europe rather than in the Central and West African countries where the virus is endemic and are predominantly not linked to travel. Scientists are therefore looking into what might explain this unusual surge of cases, while public health authorities suspect there is some degree of community transmission. Some countries have begun to offer vaccines to close contacts of confirmed cases.

UK monkeypox cases rise to 90 as doctors issue warning over skin symptoms,Katie Weston,2022-05-26 17:06:00,"There have been 10 more monkeypox cases confirmed across the UK today bringing the total to 90. The latest cases, as of May 25, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 85. There are three confirmed cases in Scotland - two of which involve people who recently travelled abroad, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as ""significant and concerning"". The body has issued symptoms to look out for and says the risk to the wider population remains low. On Wednesday, the number of monkeypox cases rose by seven, while 14 were reported the previous day. The latest figures come as the virus spreads to two new areas of the UK, with the first case being confirmed in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland reported to be hospitalised with the disease. Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. “Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks.  “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact  NHS  111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.”  UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days.

"Monkeypox patients' pet hamsters and guinea pigs may have to be culled, experts warn",,2022-05-27 03:35:00,"Monkeypox  patients should give their pets a wide berth, according to the latest guidance released by European health authorities.  They have even gone so far as to recommending that household rodents – as these are the most susceptible to the disease – such as mice, guinea pigs, hamsters and gerbils should be isolated in government laboratories or even culled. Culling has been deemed a last-resort measure, where monitored isolation and regular testing is impractical, although it has been mooted as a way of halting the disease’s progress in regions affected. “Rodent pets should ideally be isolated in monitored facilities, complying with respiratory isolation (eg. a laboratory) and animal welfare conditions (e.g. government facilities, kennels or animal welfare organisations), and tested (by PCR) for exposure before quarantine ends,” said the European Centre for Disease Control. “Euthanasia should only be a last resort reserved to situations where testing and/or isolation are not feasible.” There have been 90 reported cases of monkeypox in the UK, 85 of which are in England, while 344 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in more than 20 countries worldwide. While rodents are particularly at risk, other domesticated pets such as dogs and cats should also be kept indoors, although they are less vulnerable to the double-stranded DNA disease which is said to have originated from rodents in west and central Africa, although it was first identified in 1958 by Danish virologist Preben von Magnus in crab-eating macaques monkeys which were being used as lab animals. Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, told the Telegraph: “No cases of monkeypox have ever been suspected or reported in pets in the UK and the risk remains low. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with veterinary and public health colleagues, both in the UK and across the world, to manage the animal health associated risks with monkeypox.” The UK Government is set to publish advice in the coming days, urging monkeypox patients to keep their distance from animals and avoid close contact with them. Professor David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, revealed in the Telegraph that although the threat of monkeypox jumping from humans to pets to wildlife is low, it is a “valid concern”. “Rabbits and mice would be ones to watch, as they’re likely to be kept as pets,” he said. “This virus does have quite a wide host range which is always worrying in terms of potential to establish in a new host species… it would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with.”   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/monkeypox-patients-pet-hamsters-guinea-27078470,The Mirror
Monkeypox: How YOU can stay safe and protect yourself as UK cases soar,Kieren Williams,2022-05-27 13:46:00,"Monkeypox cases continue to rise in the UK , with 90 confirmed cases since the outbreak was first reported on May 7.   The re-emerged virus appears as a chickenpox-like rash but other  symptoms  can prove similar to everyday colds and flus.  The rash usually appears across the face, hands and arms but can spread to the genital area. Monkeypox  is a mild illness that has yet to take a life in the UK in the recent outbreak. The virus is not new, having been endemic in parts of Africa for decades.  Here the Mirror runs through how Brits can stay safe from the virus as cases continue to rise. The World Health Organisation (WHO) first advises people to limit contact with anyone who has suspected or confirmed monkeypox. If contact is unavoidable, any skin rashes or lesions should be covered up and medical masks worn. Skin-to-skin contact should be avoided, especially with the affected areas where there are rashes.  They also recommended people should regularly clean their hands with soap or an alcohol-based rub, something Brits will be used to after the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Alongside that, any clothes, towels, or bedsheets that have been touched by any person with the virus or suspected of having it should immediately be washed and surfaces decontaminated. If any Brits have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with monkeypox, they should isolate themselves and seek help by calling 111.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant  NHS  services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms.  “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” The WHO said there is not thought to be much of a risk of monkeypox spreading like Covid did, because it requires close physical contact with someone who is infectious. A vaccine for the re-emerging virus does exist and health chiefs in the country recently snapped up 20,000 doses. A smallpox vaccine called Imvanex has been supplied by Bavarian Nordic to help contain any spread. However, it isn’t freely available for anyone, and will only be selectively distributed to those in more immediate need of it. As things stand, anyone who has been in contact with someone with monkeypox will be given a dose. And anyone who does have the bug has been advised to isolate. The UKHSA compiled a list of monkeypox symptoms that Brits should keep an eye on and be aware of to make sure they stay safe. The signs may include: Fever Headache Muscle aches Backache Chills Exhaustion Night sweats Cold-like symptoms, such as congestion and runny nose Swollen lymph nodes Swollen groin Rash Complications of the illness were documented as: Low mood Severe pain Conjunctivitis However, monkeypox is usually a very mild illness and people tend to recover in two to four weeks. In some rare cases if a person becomes seriously unwell they may require hospital treatment.

Monkeypox cases up by seven as study warns virus remains infectious after scabs heal,Kelly-Ann Mills,2022-05-25 16:06:00,"There have been seven more monkeypox cases confirmed in England and Scotland today bringing the total to 78. The UK Health Security Agency, who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as ""significant and concerning"". The body said the risk to the wider population at this stage remains low and have issued symptoms to look out for. On Tuesday the number of monkeypox cases rose by 14.  The news comes as a study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared.  The Lancet report looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission.

It does not usually spread easily between people, but can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. The illness has spread across the UK with a first case recorded in Scotland on May 23.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet.  The virus is usually mild but can be more serious in children under 5 and the vulnerable.  Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, is being urged to immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service.  A notable number of cases have been gay and bisexual men, so UKHSA have warned this community to be particularly alert to the symptoms. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said:“We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.”   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-monkeypox-cases-up-seven-27059178,The Mirror
Monkeypox expert reveals how outbreak could become endemic as cases soar in UK,Ryan Fahey,2022-05-27 13:37:00,"Monkeypox  could become a serious issue in the  UK  if it spreads to  pets  and other wildlife, an expert on global health threats has warned.   Dr Anthony Renshaw - who has overseen projects across the world as Regional Medical Director of the EMEA region at  International SOS  - says the virus is ""behaving in a slightly unusual way"" compared to  outbreaks  seen in countries where the disease originated like the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC].  Since May 13, an unprecedented number of cases have been recorded outside of origin countries - with the World Health Organisation now asking world leaders to observe the disease watch how it develops. Cases of monkeypox in the UK were very rare up until this recent outbreak - but the virus could pose a serious threat if it takes hold and spreads through the animal population. The infection is currently thought to be transmitted through ""respiratory droplets"" that people spread when engaging in face-to-face contact, touching or even by sharing bedding. Dr Renshaw told the Mirror: ""If it were to become established in animals here, because then it would become an endemic virus and we'd periodically have outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. ""If it becomes transmitted in a different way, that could potentially change things."" On Wednesday, pet owners with monkeypox were warned to avoid close contact with animals over fears the virus could spread to them cause irreparable damage to wildlife. The disease - which causes a mild illness, fever and a facial rash that can spread across the body if left untreated - was first detected in a colony of monkeys in the modern-day DRC in 1958, with the first human case recorded in 1970. The WHO has now logged at least 237 confirmed monkeypox cases across the world in countries including the UK, Spain, Portugal and Canada. Dr Renshaw said the disease is ""behaving in a slightly unusual way"" due to spreading between humans with greater ease than it ever has before and because it has emerged in ""countries where it's not normally found"". The doctor said this outbreak has been ""really distinguished"" by ""human to human spread"". ""And human to human spread is thought to be through large respiratory droplets when someone coughs and laughs or sneezes,"" he added. While Dr Renshaw urged caution, he said the disease is not like Covid which is transmitted rapidly from human to human. There is a still a lot of research to be done to learn why the current monkeypox outbreak is spreading so easily among people, he added - but the virus isn't thought to be sexually transmitted. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. Dr Renshaw explained: ""People who identify as being men who have sex with men or bisexual men it’s important that they in particular are mindful of the symptoms and how to prevent being infected - but really everybody should be aware because it doesn’t just affect that group."" The doctor added the ""very old disease"" was not seen in those communities in earlier outbreaks. He said: ""It's not confined to this group, it's being seen in other groups. ""And with the monkeypox outbreaks we've seen in Nigeria and the DRC and other countries, it's not been spread in that way."" It comes as health authorities confirmed another eight people have been infected in England, lifting the total number of cases in the UK to 90. The first case of the virus was confirmed yesterday in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland is reported to be in hospital with monkeypox. People with unusual rashes or lesions, particularly if they have had a new sexual partner, have been urged to limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health clinic. Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population ""remains low"". Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately. ""To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed. “Everyone is being asked to be aware of the monkeypox symptoms, but it is important that gay and bisexual men are alert as it’s believed to be spreading in sexual networks.  “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact  NHS  111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.  Outside of Africa there are now 237 confirmed cases with the World Health Organisation asking health authorities worldwide to ""increase the surveillance"" of the disease to ""understand where it's going"".

How contagious is monkeypox? Expert says patients can spread for up to 4 weeks,Benjamin Lynch,2022-05-26 14:19:00,"Cases of monkeypox  can be  infectious for a long time,  according to scientists working on controlling the disease.  The virus is still spreading with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reporting that there were 79 cases reported as of May 24 this week.  The first  cases of the virus in Northern Ireland and Wales have also now been identified , while Scotland already confirmed one case on Monday.   It's important to be aware of the virus in order to limit the spread, though symptoms are usually mild and the  smallpox vaccine  is already reported to be 85% effective against it.   The UKHSA said: ""Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service""   Some are wondering  how contagious the virus  is as scientists have now said the virus can spread for up to four weeks.  Reports suggest that monkeypox can be spread for up to four weeks after infection in some cases thanks to the skin lesions that come with the disease. One study suggested some patients could be infectious for up to 10 weeks. The chickenpox-like blisters are reportedly contagious until they have gone according to one expert. Gay and bisexual men appear to have been disproportionately affected and people are being warned about sexual contact and ""close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox"". This includes things like bedding and clothes. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explained that people are not contagious during the virus' incubation period which can last from five to 21 days, but averages between seven and 14 days. Health expert at Southampton University Dr Michael Head told the Mail: ""Based on previous monkeypox outbreaks and guidance from [UK health authorities] and WHO, the infectious period (i.e. when the virus can be transmitted to another person) can be comparable to the time period where the rash and blisters are present. This may be for two weeks, and may be longer. ""Specifically here in this outbreak, we’re learning more about the cases and their presentations, and so many basic questions about their epidemiology are still to be clarified."" High-risk contacts of people with confirmed cases are being advised to isolate for up to 21 days. It is not yet known fully why the virus is spreading much more than it normally does - it is usually found in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo - and if it will soon be more easily spread. Scientists are working hard to try and make sure they keep on top of the virus. Dr Head said: ""If onward transmission can indeed take place over a longer period of time, early identification of any possible cases is going to be vital in efforts to break those chains of transmission and contain the outbreak."" UKHSA warned anyone who suspects they may have the virus should take appropriate action. The health body's Chief Medical Adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said: ""We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and NHS services. ""If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible – though please phone ahead before attending in person.

Can pets get monkeypox? Expert reveals risks to dogs and cats as UK cases rise,Jessica Knibbs,2022-05-25 16:48:00,"Monkeypox cases  are on the rise in the UK, with  78 confirmed infections  since the start of May 2022.  Virologist Dr Amr Bayoumy, spoke exclusively with the Mirror to discuss how the disease is transmitted, and whether we should be worried about it spreading to our dogs and cats.  Dr Bayoumy of Coventry University began by reassuring that  monkeypox is not another Covid .  “The spread of monkeypox from infected individuals to another person is through prolonged contact,"" he told us. “This is via mucous membranes, lesions, open cuts or wounds or certain materials such as bedding, towels or clothes.” Discussing the history of the disease, Dr Bayoumy revealed that the virus never began with monkeys, but rather in rodents. He explained it was later called monkeypox when it was isolated in a lab on monkeys, and that's how the name came about. In short, pet owners have little to worry about as it's unlikely you could pass on the monkeypox infection to your cats and dogs. “Since [monkeypox was first recorded], there have been periodic outbreaks of the disease in Africa and in USA in 2003,"" said the expert.  “In the case of the American outbreak, infected prairie  dogs  and squirrels were the cause with experts still unsure as to how the squirrels were originally infected.”   But infection among pet dogs and  cats  is unlikely.  “We need more monitoring but for now there have been no reported cases of dogs or cats being infected,” he added. “Big rodents can be susceptible to monkeypox, however.” When asked why some animals may be more susceptible to others, Dr Bayoumy said: “The disease requires specific receptors found in certain animals organisms making them either more or less susceptible.”  Dr Bayoumy warned those most at risk of monkeypox include children and younger people, healthcare workers or those with compromised immune systems, such as those   living with HIV .  “Fatality for monkeypox is around 3-6% and may be higher among children,"" the virologist explained. “Children’s immune system has not been exposed to viruses and they have a weaker immune system. “Also, people aged under 40 years may not have been vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine when younger, making them more at risk.” Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 after a vaccine programme run by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The vaccine was stopped after smallpox was declared extinct. Dr Bayoumy said: “From 0 to five days a person will experience fever, headache, muscle ache and swollen lymph nodes. “Skin eruption will occur within one to three days after the fever.” Dr Bayoumy stressed that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted virus and can be spread through prolonged contact, which doesn’t always mean sexual contact. For those concerned about any pet animals, PetMD.com recommends keeping kennels clean and hygienic at all times. The site also says to clean your dog regularly and to stop your dog coming into contact with faeces. Public Health England recommends keeping away from pets when self-isolating and to wash your hands in between any contact.

Monkeypox outbreak: Covid-like tracker being made to monitor spread as 90 cases hit UK,Liam Buckler,2022-05-26 18:24:00," A Covid-like tracker is being developed to help monitor the spread of  monkeypox  - as 90 cases have now been confirmed in the UK.   The  UK Health Security Agency  has already been releasing daily updates on the number of the cases through press releases.  However, UK Health officials are now reportedly working on a Covid-like dashboard in order to keep the public updated with new cases, according to The Express. It took health authorities several weeks to develop the Covid-dashboard which was launched in Spring 2020. The virus was already in circulation across the country when the dashboard was launched. However, the Covid dashboard has been an essential part of the UK's response to the pandemic as it can help monitor and track the virus across the country. A tracking dashboard for monkeypox was quickly set up by the UKHSA to help study the virus and inform the public of rising cases. Over the coming days health officials will offer official guidance on what to do if people develop symptoms of monkeypox and if they believe they have been exposed to the virus. Monkeypox is usually found in Central and Western Africa and can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets. People who are infected right now are sent to quarantine, either at home or in a specialist infectious disease ward in a hospital, after a PCR test confirms the infection. Health officials then track down close contacts and offer them shots of a vaccine that can prevent infection if administered a few days after being exposed. The UK currently has about 23,000 doses of the Bavarian Nordic Imvanex jab, which is specifically designed to combat smallpox, but has also shown to be effective against monkeypox. Each dose of the vaccine costs around £5, with a total of two doses required four weeks apart to ensure maximum protection. The vaccine needs to be given soon after being exposed to the virus in order to alter the infection. As monkeypox has a three-week incubation period, by the time a person is symptomatic, the vaccine is ineffective. Health officials believe the best way to treat the virus is to vaccinate the close contacts of the people who have detected positive for monkeypox.

Monkeypox cases rise by 25% as UKHSA warns outbreak is 'significant and concerning',Charlie Jones,2022-05-24 15:49:00,"The  monkeypox  outbreak has been dubbed ""significant and concerning"" as UK cases climbed by 24.6% since May 7. A further 14 additional cases were confirmed in England and Scotland bringing the total number of cases since May 7 to 71. The UK Health Security Agency, who are at the forefront of protecting the British public from infectious diseases and other health threats, has described the outbreak as ""significant and concerning"". The body said the risk to the wider population at this stage remains low.  Yesterday, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus.  It does not usually spread easily between people, but can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. The illness has spread across the UK with a first case recorded in Scotland on May 23.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet. It is spread by close contact.  The virus is usually mild but can be more serious in kids and the vulnerable.  Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, is being urged to immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service.  A notable number of cases have been gay and bisexual men, so UKHSA have warned this community to be particularly alert to the symptoms.

Warning to pet owners as Monkeypox 'could become endemic' if it spreads to animals,,2022-05-24 15:22:00," If pets begin catching  monkeypox  the virus could turn into an endemic and could become a permanent issue in the UK,  health  officials have warned.  According to Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), monkeypox is spreading in the UK with 57 cases now recorded. The agency announced on Monday that 36 new infections in England added to the 20 previously known patients, as well as one in Scotland. Ensuring pets are not infected is key to keeping control of the disease which can cause patients to suffer from fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion and chills. No pets are known to have been infected yet. However, the European Centre for Disease Control warned on Monday that it was important to ""manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife"". The update said: ""If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. ""Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. ""Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low."" The likes of rats, squirrels are likely to be susceptible to catching monkeypox but there are also fears that even dogs and cats could get it. Prof David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, told the Telegraph: ""It would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with."" Gay and bisexual men have been urged to regularly check for monkeypox-looking rashes or lesions on their body as they make up a ""notable proportion"" of the current cases.  Monkeypox symptoms include an unusual blemish, especially on genitalia which must be immediately reported to  NHS  111 or checked out at the patient's local sexual health clinic.  Once someone has caught monkeypox, they are considered infectious until all their scabs have dropped off - which can take several weeks. Anyone in the UK who has been in close contact with an infected person can receive a smallpox jab called Imvanex to protect them against the disease. The virus gets its name from crab-eating laboratory macaque monkeys in 1958, who were observed to have developed pox. Then 12 years later in 1970, the first human case of monkeypox was detected in Democratic Republic of Congo. Rather than monkeys spreading the disease, it is rodents as seen in the 2003 US outbreak, which was traced back to imported rodents from Ghana. According to the World Health Organisation, the case fatality rate of the milder strain that has spread globally, is around 3-6%. This is compared to the more serious strain known to have a fatality rate of 10%.

Monkeypox spreads to two new areas of UK as cases hit 80 and close contacts traced,Kelly-Ann Mills,2022-05-26 10:54:00,"Cases of monkeypox have spread to two new areas of the UK, as cases hit a total of 80, health authorities have confirmed. The first case of the virus has been confirmed in Wales and one person in Northern Ireland is reported to be in hospital with monkeypox. Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: “We are working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. “The case is being managed appropriately.

The UKHSA will update the totals later today. Their last update stated that 77 cases were in England and one in Scotland.  Now there are also one in Northern Ireland and one in Wales too. Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population “remains low”. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness. The news comes as a study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are  no longer contagious  once their lesions have disappeared.  The Lancet report looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.”  Earlier this week, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus.

Monkeypox patients must 'keep away from pets' amid fears virus could spread to animals,Tim Hanlon,2022-05-26 01:22:00," Pet owners with  monkeypox  will reportedly be advised to avoid close contact with their animals over fears that the virus could spread to them with terrible consequences for wildlife.  The advice will be issued by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs later this week with the warning of a potential risk of human-to-animal transmission laid out, reports the Daily Mail. It follows the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) having stated that the virus has the potential to spread to pets and then into nature. Seven more cases of monkeypox have been identified in England, in latest figures from health officials. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the new cases bring the UK total since May 7 to 78. Among these cases, 77 were identified in England and one case has been reported in Scotland. As of May 24, no cases had been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland.  People with unusual rashes or lesions, particularly if they have had a new sexual partner, have been urged to contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health clinic.  But health officials stressed people should phone ahead before attending in person. Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, backed the advice of people taking care with their pets.  ""It would be a sensible decision to keep your distance from a pet while in quarantine,’ she told the  Daily Mail. ""If I was diagnosed with monkeypox I would do whatever I could to limit contact, such as asking a friend or relative to take care of it."" She added: ‘There is currently no evidence of transmission between humans and cats and dogs but we know rabbits and rodents are susceptible.  The ECDC said it is important to: ""manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife"", reported the  Daily Record .  They warned that rodents could be effective hosts for the disease, and could spread the virus more effectively than humans. The announcement said: ""If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe.

"Severe monkeypox patients could be infectious for up to 10 WEEKS, scientists warn",Katie Weston,2022-05-25 15:14:00,"Severe monkeypox patients could be infectious for up to 10 weeks, according to scientists. A study released by the Lancet Infectious Diseases analysed seven cases of the virus in Britain between 2018 and 2021. The research showed one man in his 40s tested positive over 70 days after he first displayed symptoms of the disease. One of the study's authors, Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. ""We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease."" The patient in his 40s was hospitalised for 39 days before being released, only for the rash to return a month and a half later. He also suffered from swollen lymph nodes.

Countries where monkeypox confirmed as worldwide cases near 100 after outbreaks,Rachel Hagan,2022-05-24 14:16:00," Health authorities across the globe are on high alert as cases of  monkeypox  are on the rise across at least a dozen  countries .   This is the first time there has been an international  spread  on such a large scale.  The virus first originated in 1970 in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo and is endemic in parts of Africa.  As of May 21, there were nearly 100 confirmed cases across the world with the highest recorded by any country in the  UK , at 56.  Denmark yesterday became the latest country to confirm cases. There have been no deaths so far and while the spread is alarming as it is new and unknown, health officials have said not to worry.  Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable  disease control  and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, told The Mirror: ""This will be limited and generate a few clusters and then it will go away.  ""My expert and the considered view is that this is not something that will spread as it doesn't go down the aerosol route therefore it is much easier and entirely possible to contain it."" How is the situation across the rest of the globe? Europe At least 85 cases have been confirmed in eight European countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Spain has been the source of a large spread across Europe, with 30 cases on Sunday all traced to a single superspreader event at a sauna in its capital, Madrid. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and is investigating another 67.  There is also believed to be a case in Spain involving a British tourist. A spokesman for the  Canary Islands’  Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.”  Belgium became the first country to introduce compulsory quarantine, ordering any monkeypox patients to stay home for three weeks. ""The country so far has just four cases, with all but one linked to a festival in Antwerp. French health authorities discovered its first case in the Paris region last week and declared three more cases on Monday. Portugal's health authorities reported 14 new cases on Monday, bringing the total count to 37. Authorities are investigating a festival in Gran Canaria after it was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. The Netherlands declared that “a few cases” had been found on Saturday, while Denmark said on Monday it had its first case in a man who had just returned from Spain.  Brits feared to have  monkeypox  were quarantined in Greece as medics panicked over a rash. They later tested negative for monkeypox.  There are around four confirmed cases in Germany which have been linked to exposure at “party events” including in Berlin. Australia Australia has just two cases, one case in a traveller who had just returned from the United Kingdom, and another likely case in someone who had returned from Europe. USA and Canada On Sunday, authorities in the United States said they may have found a third case of the monkeypox virus and were running tests on a patient in South Florida. The first case was reported in Boston on May 18, followed by another in New York City on May 19. While Canadian public health officials confirmed 5 cases in Quebec and are investigating more elsewhere. West Africa The disease is endemic in a large number of West African countries, meaning it is regularly found in people there. Those countries are Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (animals only), Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan, according to the World Health Organisation. In those countries, there are unsurprisingly a number of cases including 46 in Nigeria, 25 in Cameroon and six in the Central African Republic.

Monkeypox fears hit Canary Islands as Brit tourist tested for virus on Fuerteventura,Antony Thrower,2022-05-24 07:24:00,"A British tourist visiting Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands  is feared to have monkeypox . Health chiefs in the  holiday isle  are currently looking into five suspected cases of the virus. If confirmed,  the Brit would be the first affected in Spain since the nation confirmed its first cases  last week.  A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service said in a short statement: “A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is unknown if is alone on the island or in a party also being tested.  Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and said another 67 people are being tested. Europe is in a heightened state of alert for the rare condition  which causes symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Last week Spain reported a number of infections, mainly in the Madrid region where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. A Gran Canaria pride festival attended by 80,000 people from Britain and other European countries is also being probed. Health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero added at the time: “The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis... to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible.” Most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment. Yesterday it was confirmed the number of monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 57, according to the UK Health Security Agency. On Friday, there were 20 cases in England and that figure was expected to climb, with a further 36 now confirmed. Scotland also recorded its first case , taking the total to 57. Dr Nick Phin, the medical and public health science director at Public Health Scotland, said the infected individual is ""being managed and treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance"". Monkeypox is rarely passed between people but can be via close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has the virus, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. A large proportion of cases identified in men who have sex with other men communities. It is not normally a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.

"Monkeypox remains infectious long after scabs have healed, worrying study suggests",,2022-05-25 01:47:00," As the number of  monkeypox  cases in the UK rose to 71 on Tuesday, a report has revealed that people afflicted by the viral disease may actually be infectious long after their scabs and rashes have healed.  A study published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal has poured cold water on the theory that monkeypox patients are no longer contagious once their lesions have disappeared. The Lancet report looked at seven people who had monkeypox – a close relative of the smallpox virus – in Britain between 2018 and 2021, with all cases linked to Africa. None of the patients died or needed intensive care treatment, but some were admitted to hospital as a precaution to prevent any onward transmission. Co-author Dr Hugh Adler, a research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We can see the virus remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved. “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.” Fellow co-author Dr Catherine Houlihan, of the UK Health Security Agency and University College London, added: “During previous outbreaks of monkeypox, patients were considered infectious until all lesions crusted over. “In these seven UK cases, viral shedding was observed for at least three weeks following infection. “However, data on infectivity remains limited, and is an important area for future study.” Experts have also allayed parents’ fears about children catching the disease.  Dr David Porter, a paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s  NHS  Foundation Trust, admitted that cases in the UK were rare.  He said: “As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don’t think parents should be worried about this being monkeypox at this stage, because we’re seeing a very low number of cases. “And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we’ve seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it’s been predominantly in adults.” The study also suggests that some antiviral medications might have the potential to shorten symptoms and reduce the amount of time a patient is contagious. The cases analysed represent the first instances of in-hospital transmission and household transmission outside of Africa, as well as reporting the patient response to the first off-label use of two different antiviral medications – brincidofovir and tecovirimat (drugs designed to target smallpox) – to treat the disease. The report found little evidence that brincidofovir was of clinical benefit, but did conclude that further research into the potential of tecovirimat would be warranted. The study did not look at the current outbreak in Britain, with the majority of the 71 cases catching it in the community, and a sizeable proportion in gay and bisexual men. Dr Nick Price, of Guy’s & St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, a senior author on the paper, added: “Until now, monkeypox has been a rare, imported condition in the UK and the NHS High Consequence Infectious Diseases Network has treated all seven of the UK’s confirmed cases until 2021. “Outbreaks outside of Africa are unusual but in recent days, significant outbreaks have been reported in several European countries, including the UK, and further afield globally. “Clinical trial data is lacking and we are pleased to share some of our collective experience in managing this previously rare and sporadic condition.”   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-remains-infectious-long-after-27057145,The Mirror
Monkeypox vs shingles - key symptoms and difference in rashes to look out for,Jessica Knibbs,2022-05-23 16:18:00," The first case associated with the current  outbreak of monkeypox  was reported in the UK on May 7 from a person who had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the disease.  Since then, there have been more than 80 cases in at least 12 countries. The disease causes a distinctive rash on the body that shares similarities with shingles.  As with monkeypox,  shingles symptoms  prior to a rash include weakness, chills and muscle aches.  Some people also develop pain, itching, tingling, and burning on the skin before the rash appears. There are some key similarities between monkeypox and shingles that may cause concern for many. Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic disease - meaning it’s caused by germs that spread between animals and people. The virus transmits via large droplets that can only travel a short distance, but it can also be spread through direct contact with skin lesions or, sometimes, contaminated bedsheets or clothes. A monkeypox rash usually appears one to five days after the first symptoms. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body. Monkeypox is synonymous with a rash which can appear on the:  Shingles is a painful condition caused by the same virus that causes  chickenpox .   According to the  NHS , anyone can get it, but it's most common in older people.  In fact, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) warns that ""one in three adults"" will go to develop shingles during their life. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, about 50% of people who live to age 85 will develop shingles at some point in their life. Shingles is a viral infection which as with monkeypox, causes a painful rash. The symptoms of shingles include:  “Shingles can sometimes be mistaken for another skin conditions, such as hives, psoriasis, or  eczema ,” says Medical News Today.  The health site added: “At first, the shingles rash appears as small, raised dots. “One difference between shingles and other rashes is the pattern that develops. The shingles rash often develops in a pattern along the nerves of the chest and belly.” The site added that the best way to know for sure if it is shingles or something more serious such as monkeypox is to speak with your GP. “In most cases, a doctor can make a diagnosis based on medical history, a physical exam, and symptoms,” it added.

Brits quarantined in Greece over monkeypox fears as first case found in Scotland,Antony Thrower,2022-05-23 14:22:00," Brits feared to have  monkeypox  were quarantined in Greece as the first case of the virus was detected in Scotland.  A 29-year-old man and another male were transferred from Attiko Hospital in Haidari to the island of Kefalonia over the weekend as medics panicked over a rash. They later tested negative for monkeypox which has now been found in several European countries - but positive for harmless chickenpox. It comes as Greece enters a heightened state of alert for the rare condition which causes symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. It is usually contained to countries in Africa. A statement from Norwegian firm EpiGuard- who are experts in medical isolation and transportation- confirmed its plane landed at Kefalonia airport to pick up two British tourists diagnosed with symptoms reminiscent of monkeypox. They said: “Shortly after 11pm Saturday, May 21, the Hellenic Air Force’s C-130 Hercules landed at Kefalonia airport to pick up two British tourists diagnosed with symptoms reminiscent of monkeypox. “On a day-to-day basis the EpiShuttle is used to transport patients with suspicion of covid, ebola, measles, tuberculosis, and now also monkeypox, across the globe. “The EpiShuttle can isolate any contagious patient, regardless of disease, and efficiently protect the staff and society at large.” Latest updates suggest monkeypox is spread via very close contact such as sex with most of the initial cases detected among homosexual men. Earlier today Public Health Scotland confirmed its first case in the country.  Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland's Director of Public Health Science, said: “We are working with  NHS  Boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.  “Close contacts of the case are being identified and provided with health information and advice.” There have now been 20 confirmed cases in the UK. Downing Street has moved to reassure the public the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is monitoring monkeypox ""extremely carefully"". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We have the UK Health Security Agency who are monitoring this extremely carefully. ""The facts we know is that monkeypox is not usually spread easily between people, and the risk to others remains low. ""A notable portion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men, so the UKHSA is urging this community in particular to be alert. ""It's true to say that most people recover within a few weeks.""  Over the weekend an expert warned the    monkeypox    outbreak has reached epidemic proportions.   The    World Health Organisation    (WHO) is holding daily meetings to keep up to date with the latest on the new health threat.

"Monkeypox is not a gay disease and should not be compare to HIV, top TV doctor says",Sam Elliott-Gibbs,2022-05-24 13:44:00,"Gay  and  bisexual  men are at risk of unfair stigma with  Monkeypox  being labelled a 'gay disease', a top TV doctor believes.  Dr Ranj Singh says '  hysteria' has been created and is growing concerned after it the outbreak was compared to  HIV  online.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have alerted men that monkeypox appears to be spreading in the  LGBT+  community globally.  The organisation's Dr John Brooks emphasised that anyone can contract Monkeypox, through close personal contact regardless of sexual orientation. But he went on to say many of the people affected across the world so far are men who identify as gay or bisexual. Britain has recorded 57 cases so far, the UK Health and Security Agency, with new infections are being found ""daily"". Dr Ranj Singh wants to stop discussion about Monkeypox being  'the gay disease’ and says it is simply inaccurate to liken it to HIV.   He wrote in gay bible  Attitude Magazine  : ""We know that it spreads through close contact - it’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of men who have sex with men, who may have multiple intimate contacts, has allowed more rapid spread.  ""We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean men who have sex with men are at fault at all. ""We definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’."" Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it can be transmitted through sexual and intimate contact. Dr Brooks said: “We want to help people make the best informed decisions to protect their health and the health of their community from monkeypox."" The rare virus - which causes a rash and a fever - has been seen around the world in recent weeks. Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee to discuss the issue. Dr Hilary Jones, meanwhile, has warned of an ""unprecedented"" outbreak in monkeypox as he warned of the five symptoms to look out amid the case rise.  He opened up about the rise in cases across the world during a health segment on ITV's  Good Morning Britain  with news correspondent Ranvir Singh.  ""We know it is not a serious infection, usually.

Child in intensive care with monkeypox as medics warn cases are on the rise,Amy-Clare Martin,2022-05-22 22:09:00," A child is reportedly in intensive care with  monkeypox  as new cases are being detected daily in Britain.  It was claimed the youngster is being treated in a London hospital. Chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said the virus is being spread by community transmission in Britain.  She added: “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis. I’d like to thank all those coming forward for testing   to sexual health clinics, to GPs and emergency departments.”  A total of 20 infections have been confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency ahead of an update today. About 145 cases have been identified outside of Central and West Africa where it is most common. That includes Europe, North America and Australia. The virus is usually mild but can be more serious in kids and the vulnerable.  Monkeypox causes a fever,  headaches  and a blistering rash on the face, hands and feet. It is spread by close contact.  Dr Hopkins added: “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual.” Asked to confirm reports someone is in intensive care with monkeypox, she said: “We don’t confirm individual reports and individual patients.” The UK is treating contacts of confirmed cases with a smallpox jab that is effective against the virus. Dr Hopkins said: “There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox. ""We’re using a form of smallpox vaccine in individuals at high risk of developing symptoms.” Belgium became the first country to impose a 21-day monkeypox quarantine yesterday after recording three cases linked to a festival in Antwerp. And high-risk contacts of patients in Britain could be required to isolate for three weeks, health chiefs said. The current strain has a fatality rate of about 1%.  It tends to spread only among those with symptoms, making it simpler to control than  coronavirus .  It comes as it was revealed British scientists warned of our vulnerability to monkeypox three years ago, saying it could fill the void left by smallpox.

UK monkeypox cases more than double again as outbreak continues to spread,Alahna Kindred,2022-05-23 16:52:00,"The number of  monkeypox  cases in the UK has risen to 57, the UK Health Security Agency said today. On Friday, there were 20 cases in England and that figure was expected to climb, with a further 36 now confirmed.  Scotland today also recorded its first case, taking the total to 57. Dr Nick Phin, the medical and public health science director at Public Health Scotland, said the infected individual is ""being managed and treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance"".  Yesterday, it was reported that a  child was said to be in intensive care  with the virus. It does not usually spread easily between people.  But can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils.  An expert said superspreader events are likely to be behind the rise in global cases, with 14 different countries identifying cases, according to Harvard University. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, said ""we have never seen anything like this before, with such a number of cases"" in so many countries. However, monkeypox is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. Are you suffering from monkeypox? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk The UKHSA has purchased supplies of a safe smallpox vaccine and this is being offered to identified close contacts of someone diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox or to impose any travel bans. Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact  NHS  111 or their local sexual health service. A notable proportion of cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men and so UKHSA continues to urge this community to be alert to monkeypox symptoms. People should notify clinics ahead of their visit and can be assured their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK.  ""Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact tracing efforts – you are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK."" Dr Phin went on to describe the risk to the public as low, but warned anyone with ""blister-like sores"" on their body to seek medical attention. PHS did not say where the person was being treated or where they were located but said close contacts were being traced and would be given support, including the possibility of vaccination.  High-risk contacts of  monkeypox  patients are required to isolate for three weeks, guidance from UK health chiefs states.  Others who had a lesser degree of exposure are advised to steer clear of children, people with conditions affecting their immune systems and pregnant women - but are not required to stay home.  Today, a UK Government Minister assured that monkeypox is not a ""repeat of""  Covid-19 .  Chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News: ""As with any new disease, and obviously after the Covid pandemic doubly so, we continue to monitor this very closely. ""I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. ""There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact. ""That being the case, the risk of community transmission is much lower, we have a working vaccine, if people present with symptoms or have very close contact, then we are advising that they quarantine for three weeks but the threshold for that is quite high - it really does have to be close physical or sexual contact."" Mr Clarke said he was not aware of reports of a baby being in intensive care with monkeypox, adding: ""What I would say is we are cautious but we are certainly not in a position where I would in any way worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness."" Initial symptoms of the virus include fever or high temperature; head, muscle and backache; swollen lymph nodes; chills and exhaustion. A blister-like rash or a small number of blister-like sores can also develop, starting on the face but spreading across the body. The rash changes throughout the infection, finally forming a scab which falls off within weeks. Those with the virus are infectious between the time that symptoms start and when the last scab falls off.

"Monkeypox outbreak is 'biggest ever in Europe' and an 'epidemic', says expert",Antony Thrower,2022-05-21 12:21:00," The  monkeypox  outbreak which has been found across Europe and north America has reached epidemic proportions, an expert has warned.   The  World Health Organisation  (WHO) is holding daily meetings to keep up to date with the latest on the new health threat.  So far 20 cases have been found in the UK, with further instances in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden as well as in the US, Canada and Australia.  German scientists say the  outbreak is the largest ever seen in Europe of the viral condition  which can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills.  It is rarely found outside of Africa, which is why health leaders are raising concerns. Fabian Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute, described the current outbreak as an epidemic. He reassured: “However, it is very unlikely this epidemic will last long. “The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary.” The WHO held an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the dangers of the rare viral infection. Latest updates suggest it is spread via very close contact such as sex with most of the initial cases detected among homosexual men. Spain reported 24 new cases on Friday, mainly in the Madrid region where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. Health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero added: “The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis... to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible.” A hospital in Israel has also treated a man displaying symptoms consistent with the disease after recently arriving from Western Europe. Most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment. Dr Hans Kluge added: “Anyone who is concerned about an unusual rash should consult their doctor or healthcare provider. “People with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated from the first appearance of symptoms. “The main way it can spread is through close physical contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has monkeypox.” There are fears the summer could create more problems thanks to parties and outdoor festivals. Meanwhile there are fears monkeypox could have a ""massive impact"" on access to sexual health services, a top doctor warned. Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said she is concerned about how the infection could affect services because staff who come in contact with sufferers are forced to isolate.  She told the  BBC  that clinic staff were ""already under significant pressure"" before monkeypox was identified, making the situation worse.  She added: ""It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who's infected. ""In terms of the infection and its consequences for individuals, I'm not that concerned. ""I am concerned about our ability to maintain good sexual health services and access for everyone while still managing this new infection.""

Monkeypox disease outbreak linked to suspected superspreader event at Spanish sauna,,2022-05-22 01:21:00," The  monkeypox  outbreak spreading across the UK and around the globe has been linked to a suspected superspreader event at a sauna in the Spanish capital of Madrid.  Twenty cases of the disease endemic to west Africa have been identified in the UK, with further instances in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. as well as in the US, Canada and Australia. In the Spanish capital, most of the country’s 30 cases have been traced back to a sauna there, according to officials. Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the region’s health chief, told reporters that health officials reported a “notable proportion” of the UK and European cases are in gay and bisexual men. Portugal's first 14 cases were in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. The country confirmed a further nine cases on Friday. Have you been affected by monkeypox? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk In Belgium, three cases have also been linked to a fetish festival in Antwerp, according to The Daily Telegraph. “There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries,” the festival said on its website. Darklands is a ticketed event that describes itself as a place where “various tribes in the gay fetish community (leather, rubber, army, skinhead, puppies...) come together to create a unique spectacle of fetish brotherhood”.

"Russia looked into using monkeypox as biological weapon, claims ex soviet scientist",,2022-05-21 00:37:00,"Russia looked into the possibility of using monkeypox as a biological weapon until at least the early 1990s, according to an expert on the subject. Former Soviet Union bioweapons expert Colonel Kanat Alibekov – otherwise known as Kenneth Alibek - claimed in recently discovered interviews that the country had a programme to work out what viruses could be weaponised. He was deputy head of the USSR’s biological weapons programme until its collapse in 1991.  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which can be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa, and spread between humans via both droplet respiration or an infected person's bodily fluids. It comes as Health Secretary  Sajid Javid  revealed yesterday (Friday) there are now 20 cases currently in the UK.  Dr Alibekov said: ""So we developed a special program to determine what 'model' viruses could be used instead of human smallpox. We tested vaccinia virus, mousepox virus, rabbitpox virus, and monkeypox virus as models for smallpox. ""The idea was that all research and development work would be conducted using these model viruses. Once we obtained a set of positive results, it would take just two weeks to conduct the same manipulations with smallpox virus and to stockpile the warfare agent. We would have in our arsenal a genetically altered smallpox virus that could replace the previous one.""  The eradication of smallpox through global vaccine programmes forced the Soviets to ditch the idea. Dr Alibekov said in a 1998 interview that stray cases caused by an accidental leak in  Russia  would now be ""difficult to explain to the international community"".   Russian  Ministry of Defence  decided to continue working with monkeypox to ""create future biological weapons"" after the end of the USSR, the doctor added.  He was previously brought before a United States Congress hearing, where he said he was ""convinced that Russia’s biological weapons program has not been completely dismantled"".

First monkeypox signs and will there be a lockdown as high-risk people advised to isolate,Benjamin Lynch,2022-05-23 12:08:00,"More cases of monkeypox  have been confirmed around the world and  health authorities are rapidly responding to the virus .   The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has advised  anyone who is at risk of catching the virus should isolate for 21 days , as part of a ramping up of test and trace efforts.  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), those considered high-risk are people who have had face-to-face contact without PPE with someone infected, direct physical or sexual contact, or contact with contaminated materials like clothing or bedding. Isolating people have been told not to travel, to provide UKHSA with their contact details and to avoid people with immune system problems, children under the age of 12 and pregnant women. Over 80 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in at least 12 countries so far, with 20 of them so far detected in England since the start of May.  The  first signs of a monkeypox infection  include a headache, fever and chills, as well as fatigue to the point of exhaustion.  Other reported initial symptoms included muscle aches, backache and swollen lymph nodes. The UKHSA explained the symptoms: ""A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. ""The rash changes and goes through different stages – it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off."" The health agency reports that the virus appears to be disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual young men. It added: ""The virus spreads through close contact and UKHSA is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or MSM [men who have sex with men], to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns."" Monkeypox infections tend to clear up slowly, between 14 to 21 days Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UKHSA, said: ""We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally.  ""Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact  NHS  111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns.""  There is currently absolutely no indication whatsoever there will be a lockdown as a result of monkeypox. A UK Covid lockdown was issued in March 2020 because the virus was easily spread and there was no vaccine at the time, meaning that though most people (except the vulnerable and elderly) did not get serious symptoms, people were forced to isolate in order to protect the NHS and its limited bed spaces. Scientists are now working to understand why monkeypox cases are spreading at an faster than usual rate.  The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Professor Jimmy Whitworth told the  BBC  : ""I don't think the general public need to be worried at this stage, but I don't think we've uncovered all of this and we are not in control of this.""  Smallpox vaccines are reported to be 85% effective against the virus. Monkeypox cases are very low and although it is not clear why it currently seems to be spreading in Western countries, there is little to no concern it will take hold. Fear around the prospect of a lockdown appears to be due to nervousness thanks to the experiences of people during the Covid pandemic during the last two years.

Belgium becomes the first country in the world to introduce monkeypox quarantine,Dave Burke,2022-05-22 19:30:00,"Belgium has become the world's first country to bring in a compulsory quarantine for people with monkeypox. The virus has swept through Europe in the past fortnight, with 20 cases confirmed in the UK and nine other countries confirming outbreaks. Authorities in Belgium have announced that those found to have the virus, which has many characteristics of smallpox, to isolate for 21 days. It follows meetings between the country's Risk Assessment Group and health authorities. The country has so far announced four cases of monkeypox - at least three linked to a gay fetish festival in Antwerp called Darklands. Festival organisers said in a statement: ""There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries."" Monkeypox is spreading through community transmission in the UK with more cases being detected daily, a senior doctor has warned. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed 20 cases of the disease in the UK with nine other countries outside of Central and West Africa also reporting outbreaks. The disease, which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact - including sexual intercourse - and is caused by the monkeypox virus. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for UKHSA, said updated figures for the weekend will be released on Monday as she warned of more cases ""on a daily basis"". She also warned that doctors are seeing community transmission with cases predominantly being identified in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual or men who have sex with other men.  Speaking to  BBC  One's Morning Show, Dr Hopkins said: ""We will be releasing updated numbers tomorrow - over-the-weekend figures.  ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I'd like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department."" Asked if there is community transmission in the UK, she said: ""Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country. ""The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men."" Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: ""That's because of the frequent close contacts they may have. ""We would recommend to anyone who's having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash."" Asked if people will need to get vaccinated for the infection, she said: ""There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox but we are using a form of smallpox vaccine - a third-generation, smallpox vaccine that's safe in individuals who are contacts of cases. ""So, we're not using it in the general population. ""We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ""For contacts, (this) reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point.""  It comes as US president  Joe Biden  said that recent cases of monkeypox which have been identified in Europe and the United States are something ""to be concerned about"".  In his first public comments on the disease, Mr Biden added: ""It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential.""

Monkeypox now in eight countries as WHO warns summer parties could accelerate spread,Antony Thrower,2022-05-20 16:42:00,"Infections of monkeypox have now spread  to eight different countries in Europe, with fears summer parties could worsen cases.  The infection has been found so far in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Outside of Europe doctors have found cases of the rare viral infection in Australia, Canada and the USA. Because of the geographically dispersed nature of cases, the World Health Organisation fears transmissions may have been spread around for some time. Monkeypox usually arises mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it was first discovered in the 1970s. Dr Hans Kluge said the situation may worsen in the summer months thanks to parties and outdoor festivals. He warned: “As we enter the summer season in the European Region, with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned transmissions could accelerate. “The cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the symptoms are unfamiliar to many. “Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which can be spread from person to person…to date, at least eight countries in the WHO European Region have reported cases in recent day. “These recent cases are atypical for several reasons, firstly because in this instance all but one of the recent cases have no relevant travel history to areas where monkeypox is endemic, in West Africa or Central Africa. “Secondly, because most of the initial cases found are being detected through sexual health services and are among men who have sex with men. “And thirdly, because of the geographically dispersed nature of the cases.” According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Reassuringly, most of the cases currently under investigation in Europe have so far been mild with most of those infected expected to recover within a few weeks without treatment However, the disease can be more severe, especially in young children, pregnant women, and individuals who are immunocompromised. Dr Kluge added: “Anyone who is concerned about an unusual rash should consult their doctor or healthcare provider. “People with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated from the first appearance of symptoms. “The main way it can spread is through close physical contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has monkeypox.” “That these cases are being detected and reported shows that our surveillance systems are working, and I would like to thank the countries concerned for their prompt action and transparent information sharing. “It is crucial that this collaboration continues as the situation evolves further.”  It comes  as the number of UK monkeypox cases doubled in a day  as fears of the disease spreading through communities grow.   Health Secretary    Sajid Javid    said the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had confirmed 11 more cases of monkeypox in the UK, with most being described as mild.  The new cases come on top of the nine previously identified, with the initial case having returned from travel to Nigeria.

Monkeypox symptoms in animals as the virus spreads across the world,Paige Freshwater,2022-05-20 15:36:00,"Monkeypox cases have been reported across the world including in the UK - here's what you need to know. While it is not a new infection, having originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, its sudden smattering of cases in several European countries has caused alarm. New cases have today been reported in France, Italy, Sweden and Australia - with them rising in the UK. It has prompted The World Health Organization (WHO) to gather a group of leading experts in an emergency meeting today to discuss the ongoing outbreak.  For pet owners, WHO has warned various species - including prairie  dogs , rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates and other animals yet to be determined - are susceptible to the  monkeypox  virus.     Sign up to our  TeamDogs newsletter  for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.    Following a study into monkeypox in 2013, an extract from the Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, reads: ""Monkeypox is a viral disease discovered in laboratory monkeys in 1958. ""The disease most commonly occurs in central and west Africa. Many animal species and humans can be infected. ""In 2003, monkeypox infected several people in the United States after they had contact with infected prairie dogs. ""The monkeypox virus is closely related to the viruses that cause smallpox and cowpox in humans. ""Old and New World monkeys and apes, a variety of rodents, including rats, mice, squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits, are susceptible to infection. ""The complete range of animal species that can be infected by the monkeypox virus is still not known; other wild and domestic animals may be susceptible.""  It comes after The Mirror spoke to Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable  disease control  and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, about whether people should be worried.  He told the Mirror: ""It's rare because these outbreaks are often sporadic and confined to West Africa or Central Africa — it happens there and finishes there."" ""While it is not likely to trigger another Covid-like pandemic, it is probable it will continue to spread. ""Monkeypox is one of those where the mode of transmission is dual, so it can pass between animals or humans,"" he continued. ""As a result of rapid international transport and travel, what happens in one place doesn't stay in one place, but it moves very quickly to another."" Matthew Ferrari, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University, told the Telegraph that while this may not manifest as a large-scale catastrophe, this is a ""stark reminder that emergence events are not black swans and we must plan accordingly"". Dr Pankhania said: ""We need international disease surveillance, disease management and disease resources because whatever happens in one part of the world, very quickly can become a problem in another part of the world."" The virus has likely been spreading undetected for some time. ""Someone has either gone on to or returned from West or Central Africa and then in their network of friends passed on the infection while they were incubating it,"" Dr Pankhania said. Some cases have been confirmed as links with travel to the region, but not all, meaning the others caught it domestically.  Bill Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Harvard University, said on  Twitter  : ""Folks don't expect to see monkeypox and so don't diagnose it.  ""On the bright side, this implies that the severity of the infections are not extremely high or we would have noticed sooner. On the gloomier, it means there are multiple transmission chains out there already."" Monkeypox is related to smallpox with similar symptoms, but with a more severe rash.  Patients usually start with a fever, sore muscles, swollen lymph nodes and  headaches .  Generally, after one to three days, a distinct bumpy rash begins to develop. ""These little boils are affecting not only your epidermis, which is the top layer of your skin, but it is affecting the second layer of your skin too and there is potential for scarring because these pustules can get very itchy,"" Dr Pankhania said.  He added that it's very rare for  smallpox  pustules to lead to secondary scarring, same with chickenpox.  Whereas with monkeypox, it is entirely possible that you could get secondary scarring. He continues: ""This will be limited and generate a few clusters and then it will go away. ""My expert and the considered view is that this is not something that will spread as it doesn't go down the aerosol route therefore it is much easier and entirely possible to contain it."" In primates, Monkeypox usually appears as a rash that lasts between four to six weeks. It can spread all over the body but is most common in the face, limbs and tail. Whereas rabbits, rodents, and prairie dogs, are more likely to experience a fever, reddened eyes, runny nose, cough, swollen glands, depression, and loss of appetite. The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, states: ""A rash with small swellings, containing pus (pocks), and patchy hair loss can develop. In some animals, pneumonia or death can occur.""   Read More   Read More",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monkeypox-symptoms-animals-virus-spreads-27020576,The Mirror
UK monkeypox isolation rules explained with 21 day quarantine for those at highest risk,Dave Burke,2022-05-22 21:43:00,"High risk contacts of  monkeypox  patients are required to isolate for three weeks, guidance from UK health chiefs states. Others who had a lesser degree of exposure are advised to steer clear of children, people with conditions affecting their immune systems and pregnant women - but are not required to stay home. Guidelines  introduced in 2018 state that everyone identified as a contact is assessed on a ""case by case"" basis in order to contain the disease. Those identified as being at risk are divided into three categories, with those in the highest level ordered to quarantine for 21 days. The rules were brought in following cases of monkeypox in 2018, and have not been changed in light of the latest outbreak. Scroll down to see the guidance for each category of contact The UK has confirmed 20 cases of monkeypox in the past fortnight - having previously recorded just seven cases since the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970. Yesterday the World Health Organisation said there were 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases in 12 countries where monkeypox is not endemic. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said that those who come into contact with a monkeypox case are given advice based on their level of exposure. A UKHSA spokesperson said: ""The maximum isolation period for the highest category of contact is 21 days from the point they interacted with someone with monkeypox.  ""However, isolation advice is given on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific exposure circumstances of that individual so will differ among different contacts."" These are people who have unprotected direct contact or high risk contact with those with monkeypox. For people in this situation, health chiefs advise: The document states that those who fall into this contact are most likely to have had ""household contact"" and ""sexual contact"" with the person with monkeypox. They are likely to have direct exposure to a patient's broken skin, bodily fluid or items such as clothing or bedding without wearing PPE. These are people who have not had contact with broken skin or sores, but may still have had physical contact or who could have contracted the virus through droplets. They include those who have touched with unbroken skin or have been within a metre of someone with monkeypox - such as a person directly next to them on a plane. While they are not required to isolate, health protection teams are required to make daily contact for 21 days after exposure to check if they are showing any symptoms. They are advised not to come into contact with immunocompromised people, pregnant women and children under 12. The guidelines state that they can be excluded from work for three weeks if their job requires contact with anyone who falls into these categories. This group includes people who have had close contact with monkeypox patients while wearing PPE, or those who have been within one and three metres of a case. These includes people sitting within three rows from an infected person on a plane. They are not required to live under any restrictions, but are told to contact their local health protection team if they display any symptoms. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said there is ""absolutely"" community transmission of monkeypox in the UK. She also said cases have been predominantly confirmed in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual. Speaking to  BBC  One's Sunday Morning, she said: ""Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country. ""The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men."" Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: ""That's because of the frequent close contacts they may have. ""We would recommend to anyone who's having changes in sex partners regularly or having close contact with individuals that they don't know to come forward if they develop a rash."" Experts say monkeypox does not spread easily between people. The UKHSA says: ""Spread of monkeypox may occur when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir for transmission to humans), human, or materials contaminated with the virus. Monkeypox has not been detected in animals in the UK. ""The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth)."" It said that the main means of person-to-person spread are: Those who become ill usually make a full recovery within four weeks, health officials believe. But the virus can be deadly, and is believed to have a fatality rate of around one per cent. First signs of infection include: A rash usually develops within five days, often starting on the face then spreading across the body. These marks usually turn to scabs, which eventually fall off. UKHSA says: ""An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.""

Monkeypox travel warning: Brits told to stay alert for symptoms as virus spreads,Graeme Murray,2022-05-22 13:58:00,"Brits should be alert for symptoms of monkeypox as Belgium becomes the first nation to introduce restrictions. Cases are spreading across Europe and Belgium, which has recorded three cases, has introduced a mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone suffering from the virus. Outbreaks have been reported in Spain, Portugal and central Africa and on Friday Spain reported 23 cases some of which were linked to a sauna in Madrid. An island festival in Spain attended by 80,000 people is is believed the source of cases in Spain and Italy. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed 20 cases of the disease in the UK with nine other countries outside of Central and West Africa also reporting outbreaks. More cases of the disease are being reported every day in the UK, according to Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for UKHSA.  Dr Hopkins said in an interview with the  BBC  that younger children were more at risk.  She said: ""We do know from reports from Africa, where the disease has circulated in outbreaks over many years, certain individuals are much more at risk of severe disease, including immuno-suppressed individuals or young children. ""In adults, it is relatively mild."" The disease, which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact - including sexual intercourse - and is caused by the monkeypox virus. Medics are still learning about the illness as it is a new disease which has not been circulating in the community. She told the BBC: ""Clearly, this is a new infectious disease that we haven't seen in our community before. ""We will need to learn a lot about it over the coming weeks."" There were 20 cases of monkeypox on Friday and Dr Hopkins said updated figures for the weekend will be released on Monday as she warned of more cases ""on a daily basis"". She was asked about the risk to those going to summer festivals and kids on holidays abroad. She told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis. ""We know there's been a period of restrictions across Europe and we don't know where this infection has come from and how it's come into Europe. ""There's no obvious connection in our cases in the UK to a single event."" ""The risk to the general population remains extremely low,"" she said - but added: ""People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it."" Symptoms include a viral illness, before a rash like chickenpox spreads across the body. Those who feel they have any of these must ""stay at home"", Dr Hopkins said. ""If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic,"" she said. It's believed Covid lockdowns across the world may have fuelled the spread of the virus. ""We know there's been period of restrictions across Europe, and we don't know where infection has come from,"" she said. ""There is no obvious connection to a single event in our cases in the UK.""

Brit causes monkeypox outbreak in Australia after it reports first case of virus,Rachel Hagan,2022-05-20 09:45:00,"Australia  has reported its first  monkeypox  case from someone who recently travelled from the UK.   A second case of the  virus  has been confirmed in a man in New South Wales who also recently travelled back to the country from Europe.  Both men, in their 30s and 40s, are presenting mild symptoms so but ones which are clinically compatible with monkeypox, health officials said. The man in his 30s arrived in Melbourne on Monday, Victoria state's health department said, while the second case was identified in Sydney in a man in his 40s. Dr Kerry Chant, New South Wales' state chief health officer, said a preliminary test in the Sydney man was positive and subsequent testing confirmed the case. She said: ""Just to reassure the community, it is not the same spread mechanism as Covid or flu, where it is more fleeting."" The Victoria health department said on Friday: “Testing has confirmed that he has the virus and he remains in isolation at the Alfred with mild symptoms."" Monkeypox usually arises mainly in central and western Africa, often close to tropical rainforests, and is considered endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it was first discovered in the 1970s. However, in recent weeks, it has been identified in several non-endemic countries in recent weeks, including Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. According to the UK Health Security Agency, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. The UKHSA says: “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals. ""The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Monkeypox is spread through prolonged face-to-face contact with those who are infected with the virus, often through large respiratory droplets. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said state health authorities were closely monitoring the situation, but he believes it to be ""far less contagious"" than Covid and ""things of that nature."" He continued: “We should be taking this seriously [but] at the same time I would say that no one should be alarmed at this point. We’ve got the best health authorities in the world.” The state’s chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said fatality rates are between 1 and 5 per cent. Canada also reported its first two confirmed cases of monkeypox on Thursday night, with 17 further cases under investigation in Montreal.

Monkeypox spreads to two more European capital cities with fears cases may explode,Kieren Williams,2022-05-18 14:02:00,"Monkeypox  is now suspected or confirmed to have spread to at least three European capitals, as  cases  continue to rise in the UK.  London, Lisbon, and Madrid all have either confirmed or said they have suspected monkeypox cases. The UK continues to monitor the emerging virus which is believed to have originated in central and west Africa. As things stand London has six confirmed cases, Lisbon has five confirmed cases but a suspected 15 more and today officials in Madrid announced that they were investigating eight suspected cases. A spokesperson for Madrid’s regional health department confirmed the cases were suspected as monkeypox and being analysed to confirm a diagnosis. They said: “Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the eight suspected cases point towards fluid contact. “The eight suspected cases in Madrid are among men who have sex with men. They are doing well but this illness can require hospital treatment.” They added that a nationwide alert had been issued. Lisbon was one of two regions in Portugal with a monkeypox outbreak, along with the Tagus Valley. Portuguese authorities confirmed the cases today and said that all the men involved symptoms that included ulcerative lesions. A spokesperson for them said that similar to the UK the infected men had cases of ulcerative lesions and that they were monitoring the situation at a national level and in conjunction with European institutions. Prior to this recent spread in infections, monkeypox had only ever been detected in four countries outside of Africa, the UK, US, Israel and Singapore. And all of these cases had travel links back to Nigeria and Ghana. Similar to what was reported in Spain, the UK Health Security Agency said that all four men with the most recent cases identified as gay or bisexual and had sex with other men. UK health chiefs said the risk to the general population was low. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. “We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” Mateo Prochazka, an STI expert and head of UKHSA team investigating the outbreak, said that the pattern of spread is “highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks”.

Is there a monkeypox vaccine? What are the symptoms and who is eligible for jab?,Christian Abbott,2022-05-19 10:32:00,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has just declared a  global health emergency in the wake of monkeypox's continued spread .  It has a  lower transmission rate  than that of  Covid-19 , but can be spread through close contact with an infected person.  It's also harder to catch than Covid, but the  NHS  is still warning people to report early signs of infection.  Typically, there is a one- to two-week window after first contact before symptoms start to show, though this is sometimes as late as three weeks. It has led to the hope that a vaccine is on the way to stop the spread quickly and effectively. There is good news, but the UK is far behind in the process. Yes, there is a monkeypox vaccine and it is available in the UK. The NHS is ramping up the rollout of doses, though there is still a limited supply, currently.  It is known as Jynneos by Bavarian Nordic, a vaccine that targets smallpox and monkeypox alike, which has just been given the nod in the EU. Jynneos is based on a live, attenuated vaccinia virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA-BN), which is incapable of replicating in the human body but able to jumpstart an immune response. The smallpox vaccination is being offered to those most at risk of contracting the virus, including those who have already been in close contact, some healthcare workers, and some men who have sex with men. Those who are eligible for the jab will be contacted by the NHS. The first dose of the vaccine could help reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent future infections. Some people may be offered a second dose, too. Steve Russell, NHS Director of Vaccinations, said: “While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. “On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London, and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible. “The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice. “Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected. “We will be inviting anyone who we believe is a priority for vaccination and local teams will be working to make sure that anyone who meets the criteria set by UKHSA knows how they can get their jab. “We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are seven main symptoms of monkeypox. The symptoms are: The CDC explains: ""In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. ""Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. “The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. “The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually seven to 14 days but can range from five to 21 days."" As of July 20 2022, there were 2,162 laboratory confirmed cases in the UK. The vast majority of these cases are found in England, though it has also been detected in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.   According to the  government website , cases have been predominantly found in gay and bisexual people and men who have sex with men (MSM).  ""The virus spreads through close contact and UKHSA is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or MSM, to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns,"" says the government. Monkeypox isn’t primarily a sexually transmitted disease, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also spread through contact with clothing and linens used by an infectious person.

Two more cases of monkeypox in UK as men in LGBT community urged to watch out for rash,Alahna Kindred,2022-05-18 20:57:00,"Two additional cases of monkeypox have been found in England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. This brings the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England from May 6 to nine. One additional case was found in London and the other in South East England. Recent cases have emerged predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. The two latest cases have no travel links to a country where monkeypox is endemic, meaning it could have contracted through community transmission. The virus spreads through close contact. The UKHSA is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or MSM, to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be passed on through other close contacts with an infected person or contact with clothing or linens used by an infected person. The two new cases do not have known connections with previously confirmed cases announced on May 7, 14, and 16. UKHSA is working closely with the  NHS  and other stakeholders to urgently investigate where and how recent confirmed monkeypox cases were acquired, including how they may be linked to each other. The virus does not usually spread easily between people. The risk to the UK population remains low. Cases have also been found in  Madrid and Lisbon. Monkeypox is a viral infection usually associated with travel to West Africa.  It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, spread by very close contact with someone with monkeypox and most people recover within a few weeks. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals.

Monkeypox symptoms - how do you catch it and what does rash look like?,Benjamin Lynch,2022-05-09 13:08:00," Officials have insisted  the risk of monkeypox to the public is very low , after one patient who recently travelled to Nigeria caught the viral infection and is receiving care.  Monkeypox was confirmed in one individual in the UK  and the government is now monitoring the situation.   The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed the single infection on May 7 and said the patient was receiving care at London's Guy’s and St Thomas’  NHS  Foundation Trust, in the expert infectious disease unit.  UKHSA experts are contacting the infected person's colleagues to give health tips and advice, but insist this is only a ""precautionary measure"". Dr Nicholas Price, director of the unit, said: ""The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas’ Hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.""  In the wake of the  Covid  pandemic, alerts of little-known diseases like monkeypox can seem alarming, but the boffins caring for the patient have insisted the overall risk to the general public is very low.  Monkeypox is a viral infection first discovered in 1958, known for occurring more commonly in monkeys. In 1958, two outbreaks were recorded in colonies of monkeys kept for research, but the first human case was not recorded until 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Colin Brown of the UKHSA said: ""It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low."" The UKHSA described the disease as ""mild"" but it can be severe in some cases. It said: ""Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals."" Symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever and chickenpox-like blisters, which the NHS say the disease is often confused for. Rashes usually appear one to five days after a person's first symptoms and often begin on the face before spreading to different parts of the patient's body. According to the health service, symptoms tend to clear between two to four weeks. A full list of symptoms includes: A person can get monkeypox by coming into contact with infected wild animals, mostly in West and central Africa. The NHS explained: ""It's thought to be spread by rodents, such as rats, mice and squirrels. You can catch monkeypox from an infected animal if you're bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs."" Infected uncooked meat can also cause a person to catch the disease, or by touching fur, but person-to-person infection is very uncommon.

Monkeypox: UKHSA urges ‘everybody’ to be on alert for two key symptoms after outbreak,Alice Peacock,2022-05-19 17:55:00," The UK’s public health agency is urging people to be alert on two key symptoms of  monkeypox , amid a recent outbreak of the virus.  Two additional cases  of monkeypox have been found in England this week, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to nine.  As those needing care receive treatment in infectious disease units, health bosses in the UK have issued new advice, asking everyone to stay alert to unusual rashes around the mouth and genital area.  In an update shared by the UK Health Security Agency to  Twitter , London’s Public Health Director Professor Kevin Fenton said: “We’ve recently diagnosed a number of new cases of monkeypox in England, specifically in the greater London area.  “At this point, we’re asking everybody to be aware of the signs and symptoms which include rashes around the mouth, as well as around the genital area. “We’re especially asking gay and bisexual men, among whom we’ve been seeing an increasing proportion of cases, to be on the lookout for monkeypox.""  The virus was now  suspected or confirmed  to have spread to at least three European capitals, including London, Lisbon, and Madrid.  The UK continues to monitor the emerging virus which is believed to have originated in central and west Africa. As things stand, London has six confirmed cases, Lisbon has five confirmed cases but a suspected 15 more and today officials in Madrid announced that they were investigating eight suspected cases. Recent cases have emerged predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men - though monkeypox is not a solely a sexually transmitted infection. The two latest cases have no travel links to a country where monkeypox is endemic, meaning it could have contracted through community transmission. The virus spreads through close contact. It can also be passed on through other close contacts with an infected person or contact with clothing or linens used by an infected person. The two new cases do not have known connections with previously confirmed cases announced on May 7, 14 and 16.  UKHSA is working closely with the  NHS  and other stakeholders to urgently investigate where and how recent confirmed monkeypox cases were acquired, including how they may be linked to each other.  The virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population remains low. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.  Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to contact  NHS  111 or a sexual health clinic.  People should notify clinics ahead of their visit. We can assure them their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially. Professor Fenton earlier announced that plans were in place to stock up on treatments for the tropical disease, in case the surge continued. The incubation period for monkeypox is typically between seven to 14 days but can range from five to 21 days.

Truth about UK's monkeypox outbreak as expert warns to expect a 'handful' more cases,Dave Burke,2022-05-16 16:18:00," A global health expert has said that the UK may report a ""handful"" more  monkeypox  cases after the virus was detected in the country.  In the past two weeks there have been three confirmed infections - with just seven known cases prior to 2022, despite the virus being detected in humans more than 50 years ago. Dr Michael Head of Southampton University warned that the condition can be ""very severe"" for those who contract it, with the fatality rate varying between one and 15 per cent depending on the outbreak. But he said that its low transmissibility means the risk to the wider public is small.  At the weekend the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)  confirmed two more cases had been identified,  with one of the individuals receiving specialist care at St Mary’s Hospital in London.  The announcement came just over a week after a passenger who had travelled to the UK from Nigeria was found to have the virus. Dr Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, told The Mirror that the recent spate of cases was not cause for alarm. He said: ""It's to be expected that we'll get the occasional case here and there. ""There were also a couple in the middle of last year. ""This particular virus doesn't spread as easily, so we're not going to see a big outbreak like we did with Covid. ""It's a little bit more like Lassa fever in that regard."" Earlier this year health chiefs confirmed there had been three cases of Lassa fever, including one fatality, linked to travel to Mali. But because the virus has a low transmission rate, the outbreak is believed to have been effectively contained, Dr Head said. He believes that those who became infected with monkeypox recently may have come into contact with rats or mice carrying the virus, as person-to-person transmission is rare. Dr Head said: ""The virus is often present in rodents. ""If you have close contact with rodents or infected secretions that can transmit monkeypox. That's usually how it's transmitted."" Symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. It also reveals itself in a rash, often starting on the face, before spreading to other parts of the body - particularly the hands and feet. In most cases people recover within four weeks, and the rash forms a scab which later falls off. It can be fatal in a small number of cases, virologists have said. Dr Head said: ""Its fatality rate varies between one per cent and 15 per cent depending on the outbreak and which country you're looking at. ""It's a potentially serious condition."" He said that contact tracing has been effective in containing the virus. ""There may be a handful of cases, but we won't be seeing widespread transmission around the country,"" Dr Head said. ""That's simply not going to happen here."" There have been 10 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK. On Saturday the UKHSA said two people, who live in the same household, had been found to have the virus. One of them did not require hospital treatment and was isolating at home. Officials said where and how they acquired their infection remains under investigation.  A fortnight ago a patient who had travelled to the UK from Nigeria  was being treated for monkeypox  at the Guy’s and St Thomas’  NHS  Foundation Trust, London.  This is not being linked to the two most recent cases, the UKSHA said. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said 558 cases of monkeypox and eight deaths had been reported between 2017 and 2022. Dr Colin Brown, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said: ""We have confirmed two new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on May 7. ""While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low. ""We are contacting any potential close contacts of the case. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice. ""UKHSA and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed."" Last year a person who had travelled to Delta State in Nigeria was found to have monkeypox, alongside two family members. Prior to that there were three cases, two in September 2018 and one in December 2019, as well as a 2018 case linked to contaminated bed linen, UKHSA said. Cases in the UK are rare, with the viral infection - which was first found in humans in 1970 - most prevalent in parts of Western and Central Africa. In most instances it causes a mild illness, with fever usually followed by a rash breaking out, usually on the face. It was first discovered in a colony of monkeys in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1958, with the first human case confirmed in 1970. In most cases it is a ""mild self-limiting"" illness and the majority of people recover within a few weeks, experts say. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, monkeypox has been shown to cause death in as many as 1 in 10 patients in Africa. The CDC says: ""In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox. ""Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. ""The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy) while smallpox does not. The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7−14 days but can range from 5−21 days.""

Where are monkeypox cases in UK – and how to tell difference from chickenpox,,2022-05-17 14:44:00," Four more people in England have  been diagnosed with monkeypox , bringing the total number of cases so far up to seven. Health authorities stress that the risk to the wider public remains very low.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it has identified common contacts for two of the four most recent confirmed cases. All four of those infected self-identify as gay, bisexual or as men who have sex with men.  UKHSA chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins has urged gay and bisexual men to be watchful for any unusual lesions or rashes, and to contact a  sexual health  service as soon as possible if they notice any. It is as yet unclear how the current outbreak occurred.   There have so far been a total of seven confirmed  monkeypox  cases in the UK. Cases have been  reported  in London and north-east England.   On May 7, the first case was confirmed in England, with  two further cases  - apparently unconnected to the original - reported on May 14. A further three cases were confirmed on May 16, three of them in London and one in the north-east of England.  According to the UKHSA, all four of the new cases have the West African clade of monkeypox, which is considered to be milder than the Central African strain. The first case was reported in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the virus. However, the agency says there is no link between the latest confirmed cases and travel to a country where monkeypox is endemic. How these patients contracted the virus is currently under investigation.  The  NHS  says that monkeypox is sometimes confused with chickenpox. Like chickenpox, monkeypox causes a rash that causes small spots filled with fluid that subsequently turn scabby and can scar.  However, monkeypox is from a different family of viruses than chickenpox. The monkeypox virus is related to the virus that once caused smallpox in humans. Smallpox was declared fully eradicated by the World Health Organisation in 1980, with the UK’s last known smallpox fatality occurring in 1978. Symptoms of monkeypox usually appear within five and 21 days of infection and usually clear up within two to four weeks. Initial symptoms include high temperature, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen glands, shivering and exhaustion.

Monkeypox alert as 4 new cases found in England - and none have links to Africa travel,Antony Thrower,2022-05-16 19:24:00,"Health authorities are on alert as four new cases of monkeypox have been detected in England within the gay community, with none of the patients having travelled to Africa. Three of those identified were found in London and the fourth is in the north east of the nation. All four self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, leading to warnings from the UK Health Security Agency to those in the community to stay aware. The latest cases bring the total number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK to seven, diagnosed between May 6 and 15. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to West Africa and is spread by very close contact with someone with the virus, with most people recovering within a few weeks. There are no known connections to those who have already tested positive for the virus, which has a fatality rate varying between one and 15% depending on the outbreak. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “This is rare and unusual. “UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. “We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. “We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.” Patients needing medical care are all in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hospital, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and Guys’ and St Thomas’. The individuals have the West African clade of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African clade. Anyone within the gay community are asked to aware of any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns.

It hasn’t yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.” The Government has stocks of the smallpox vaccine, which is being offered to very close contacts of those who have been affected. Those at the highest risk of contracting the disease are being asked to self-isolate at home for 21 days, with others warned to be on the lookout for symptoms.

Professor Kevin Fenton, the capital’s director of public health, has urged people to watch out for “unusual rashes or lesions” and to contact NHS 111 before going to a hospital, GP surgery or other health setting. Cases in Britain and Europe are being seen largely among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, which Professor Fenton says suggests transmission is taking place within sexual networks. He is therefore asking men from these communities “to be particularly alert to the symptoms and to seek help immediately”.

Describing how symptoms began, Mr Tulunay said: “I had a high fever and a rash, but I didn’t think it was monkeypox. It was difficult accessing healthcare, because it was such a huge unknown.” He was forced to sleep with four blankets on despite a heatwave in London, and relied on over-the-counter medication to tackle the excruciating pain. A GP told him it could potentially be a side effect of medication that he is on, while A&E said it could be tonsillitis. Supplied Eventually, he was taken into hospital after he told a nurse he found it too painful to even swallow his own spit or drink and swallow properly. “The problem was that we didn’t know what it was and doctors didn’t know, that was really hard”, he said. “For me I’d just like to see the plan, what’s the next step, but it wasn’t possible with monkeypox. “The pain and the lesion on my face was only getting bigger, it was obviously scaring me. It’s a bit of a lonely feeling when you can’t see anyone”. On day three, tests came back to confirm that he was among the approximately 2,000 Londoners who have had monkeypox to date. He was treated by specialists with an experimental drug which is designed for smallpox, a related virus, and has since made a recovery. Most cases of monkeypox are milder than Mr Tulunay’s.

It comes after public health officials announced a spate of new cases of the  virus  last week, bringing the current total to 20. Under fresh guidance issued by the UKHSA on Sunday, anyone with “direct exposure” to a monkeypox case should remain at home for up to 21 days and refrain from travel. They are also urged to avoid contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women and children aged under 12 where possible. The UKHSA say that close contacts should also be offered a vaccine.

It is commonly found in Central and West Africa. Speaking on Sunday, Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser for the UKHSA, said updated figures for the weekend would be released on Monday as she warned the virus is spreading in urban areas - albeit at low levels. Asked if there is community transmission in the UK, she said: “Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country. “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.” The virus can be spread by exhaled droplets, contact with infected linen and skin-to-skin contact. Symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, often beginning on the face and spreading to other parts of the body. Scabs can form on the body which then fall off. In most infected patients, the virus causes a mild illness that clears up after a few weeks - though in rare cases it can cause brain swelling and sepsis.

A smallpox vaccine is currently mostly being offered to men who have sex with men who are considered to be at highest risk of exposure from monkeypox. The latest data shows that of the UK’s 2,883 confirmed or likely cases, 2,047 were recorded in London, mainly among gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.

One thing the government should be doing is obtaining a licence from the manufacturer of the vaccine to allow us to make the vaccine in this country.” The British Association of Sexual Health and HIV told the Standard that current estimates suggest only 8,300 vaccines remain available, with around 5,000 earmarked for London. This means it is “likely that the remaining number of vaccines will run out in approximately 10 to 20 days, leaving a gap in supply until the next shipment arrives in September”. It said the roll-out was “slow” and being hampered by “lack of centralised leadership” - and that the Government needed to order as many as 250,000 doses. Health officials say 150,000 doses were ordered - 50,000 of which have already been distributed to the NHS and a further 100,000 set to come on-stream next month. Ian Green, CEO of leading sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the shortfall needed to be taken “seriously at the highest level of government”. “There needs to be urgent action to salvage this situation,” he said. “We know many gay and bisexual men will be worried by news of vaccine supplies running low and our advice to them is please do not panic”.

,,,"E urope’s  monkeypox  outbreak is a “rapidly evolving event” and will spread more widely in the community if action isn’t taken, the  World Health Organisation  has warned.  The UK has seen 82 new cases this week and a total of 190 cases  which is so far the highest number of confirmed cases outside of countries where the  disease  is commonplace. The rise in cases also comes the week of the Platinum Jubilee with tens of thousands of people attending street parties or watching the royal celebrations in groups.

Dr Smallwood added: “We can really use those events to provide targeted information and advice to people.” A main focus, according to the WHO, should be festivalgoers as the summer approaches.  But it has ruled out out bans on mass gatherings as they were imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. WHO Europe regional director Dr Hans Henri Kluge said in a statement: “The WHO European region remains at the epicentre of the largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported outside of endemic areas in western and central Africa. “Rapid, amplified transmission has occurred in the context of the recent lifting of pandemic restrictions on international travel and events. The potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is high. “Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the region. “Over the coming months, many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur.” Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency said : “The risk to the general public from monkeypox is still low, but it’s important that we work to limit the virus being passed on. “We remind people that they should be alert to new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body. “If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/monkeypox-world-health-organisation-festivals-b1003690.html,The Evening Standard

The latest cases, as of May 29, bring the total number confirmed in England since May 7 to 172. There are four confirmed cases in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales, taking the UK total to 179. The figures come after the UKHSA, as well as authorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales issued joint guidance to stem the spread of the disease.

The guidance, updated on Monday, said people with suspected or confirmed monkeypox who need to travel in order to seek care should make sure any lesions are covered by clothing, wear a face covering, and avoid public transport where possible. They should also abstain from sex from the first signs of symptoms and make sure to use condoms for eight weeks after infection. The disease, first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse, and is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is usually found in west and central Africa. Symptoms are generally mild and the illness is spread through close contact with someone already infected. Most people recover within a few weeks. The UKHSA said that while the risk to the UK population remains low, people should be alert to any new rashes or lesions, which would appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body. Although this advice applies to everyone, the agency said the majority of the cases identified to date have been among men who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so is asking those people in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. People are being urged to call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre immediately if they have a rash with blisters and either have been in close contact with someone who has or might have monkeypox in the past three weeks. Those with symptoms are also being asked to call 111 if they have been to west or central Africa in the past three weeks or are a man who has sex with men. Dr Ruth Milton, senior medical adviser and monkeypox strategic response director at UKHSA, said: “This new monkeypox guidance sets out important measures for healthcare professionals and the public for managing the disease including how to safely isolate at home and reduce the risk to others. “The highest risk of transmission is through direct contact with someone with monkeypox. The risk to the UK population remains low and anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service.” More than 20 countries have reported monkeypox cases as the latest outbreak spread arond the world. The number of cases rose in Spain over the weekend by 22 cases to 120, the Spanish health ministry said on Monday.

,,,"P eople are understandably anxious about  monkeypox . They are likely more so because of their experiences during the pandemic. But although we need to take the disease seriously,  monkeypox is much less of threat than Covid . It won’t have the same impact on societies or lead to the type of control measures we have seen over the past two years. The  virus  that causes monkeypox is found primarily in small animals like rodents in parts of West and Central Africa — but was first identified in monkeys. It can sometimes spread to humans and because of international travel, it can spread to other parts of the world. But unlike  Covid-19 , which is easily transmissible and has caused huge waves of infection globally, monkeypox spreads much more slowly, requiring close contact with an infected person or animal.  Monkeypox outbreaks can generally be contained through conventional public health measures — like identifying and isolating cases early on, tracing contacts to identify people who are at risk of infection, and good practices when dealing with people who are infected. Smallpox vaccines also provide some protection against infection. They can be used if necessary in health care workers or in close contacts to reduce their risk. However, use of vaccination will be very limited and we won’t see it widely in the UK. Our public health agencies are well-placed to manage the monkeypox outbreak in the UK. We now have much more experience in areas such as contact tracing and in isolating people with infections than we did before the Covid-19 pandemic. We will continue to see cases of monkeypox in the UK and elsewhere, but our public health system has the capacity to limit the outbreak and prevent it from having a major effect on our society. The monkeypox outbreak does show how the UK must maintain a strong infection control system so that we are prepared to deal with this and any future infectious diseases that may enter the country. Finally, although people should not become unduly anxious and have a very low risk of coming into contact with monkeypox, everyone should remain vigilant and seek medical advice if they become unwell and develop an unusual skin rash.

,,,"It was a bit of a throwback,” says Oli Kasin, sitting in his Peckham flat with mild flu-like symptoms, 24 hours after receiving his first  vaccine  at the walk-in centre at Guy’s Hospital on Sunday. Just eight months ago the 32-year-old was having his third Covid jab. But this time, it’s a different virus Kasin and his friends find themselves queuing for hours to protect themselves against:  monkeypox , a smallpox-like virus which the  World Health Organisation  this week  declared a global health emergency  — its highest alert — after more than 16,000 cases were identified in 75 countries, including five deaths.  Symptoms vary, but can include a flu-like illness , and skin rashes, with one in 10 cases requiring hospital care and extreme cases leading to painful, bursting skin lesions that leave the victim “[screaming] out loud in pain”. While Covid is spread through the air, experts say monkeypox is mostly spread through forms of skin-to-skin contact such as sex, kissing, and direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs or bodily fluids. Since the outbreak was first reported in May, the majority of infections outside Africa — where the virus has been a concern for years — have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM), sparking concerns among the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Gay, bisexual and queer men currently make up 98 per cent of cases in the UK. “The idea that we’re having to go through another possible pandemic is a little bit daunting... but it probably feels more similar to the fear of HIV and what that did to the gay community,” says Kasin, who was among hundreds of mostly gay men who queued for more than two hours to get their vaccine in London this weekend. Oli Kasin queued up in London for the monkeypox vaccine   /  Oli Kasin He says the atmosphere was mixed; in many ways it was “fun” and “showed the best of the gay community: that we are on top of our health, care about ourselves and others” (”part of me was wondering if I’d find my future husband there”). But others say it brought back chilling images of waiting rooms during the 1980s AIDs epidemic, and many of their comments speak to wider fears echoing across the globe at the moment. After two years of the world being ground to a halt by a contagious virus, could we really be on the cusp of another one? Could this one reignite the stigma around gay communities like the HIV/AIDs epidemic 40 years ago? And does that stigma pose serious risks to the efforts to contain it? For virologists across the world, there are two key facts about monkeypox that are immediately reassuring: first, monkeypox is not a new disease like Covid was so we know more about it from the start; second, it is preventable by a smallpox vaccine, so a method of protection already exists and most people in the UK over the age of 50 should therefore already have protection. But it is not without its concerns and unknowns. Recent weeks have seen an unprecedented spike in cases of the disease, with more than 18,000 confirmed worldwide infections and at least 2,000 confirmed cases in the UK alone. Earlier this year, a British child among UK’s then-20 recorded cases was reported to be in a critical condition and experts are advising the public to be aware of new rashes or skin bumps, but also be aware of the other possible causes such as shingles, STIs, chickenpox, bedbugs or insect bites. Among those who have been diagnosed with monkeypox, London has quickly been earmarked as Britain’s epicentre. The “majority” of the 2,050 known UK cases have been found in London and a number of those patients are receiving medical care at specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hospital and Guy’s and St Thomas’, two of the hospitals now part of the NHS’s vaccination programme, which was stepped-up last week. Last weekend, more than 1,000 vaccinations were delivered at clinics across the capital. People line up to recieve monkeypox vaccinations at Guys Hospital   /  Getty Images Most experts say they are not concerned about a global monkeypox pandemic on the scale of Covid but naturally, rising figures and a new state of emergency have increased concerns. Could it be the next pandemic? How is it affecting LGBT+ communities, who might already feel more marginalised in society than most? And if it’s not only transmitted via sex, but also touch, why aren’t others outside of that community more worried? Among the scientific and medical communities, the overwhelming consensus is that while this monkeypox outbreak might be concerning, there is little to no risk it becoming the next Covid. “Don’t fall for fearmongering... this is not Covid,” was the message from Faheem Younus, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland this week, insisting the risk of lockdowns due to rising monkeypox cases was “0 per cent”. Tweeting to his 512,000 followers, he listed the reasons why: monkeypox is not novel, is typically non-deadly, is less contagious than Covid, has been around for five decades, and is preventable by a smallpox vaccine. Dr Gareth Nye, an endocrinology specialist at Chester Medical School, agrees. “In essence, it doesn’t spread as fast [as coronavirus] and so is easier to control,” he says, pointing out that its obvious and painful symptoms mean people are at least more likely to know they have it. Ironically, it’s actually Covid that could be (partly) responsible for rising monkeypox figures, he continues. “Our immune systems have had a break and are not used to fighting off diseases which is why so many of us have come down with bad colds.” Dr Mark Lawton, a consultant from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, suggests there are reasons we haven’t really heard of this widely before. First, public awareness of viruses was heightened after the Covid pandemic; and second, scaremongering headlines about monkeypox and widely-shared photos of its symptoms mean more people are probably aware of the particular symptoms to look for. Most years the UK often sees a smattering of cases, he points out, but these don’t normally hit the headlines, and some may go undiagnosed. So what is the concern then, if the symptoms are normally relatively mild and it’s unlikely to escalate into a pandemic? Lawton says his main concerns are twofold: first, increased pressure on already-stretched NHS services, particularly sexual health clinics. If monkeypox symptoms are identified in a patient, staff will need to take particular care with PPE since it’s a disease that’s passed on via skin-to-skin contact. “Quite simply, it slows the process down,” he says. “We need immediate action from the Government to fund additional resources”. But Lawton’s wider concern is stigmatising already-stigmatised areas of healthcare and already-stigmatised people. Whilst monkeypox isn’t technically an STI, it can be passed on through sexual contact, and there is always a particular anxiety around any disease that is passed on in this way. “The last thing we want to do is create more stigma or fear around sexually transmitted diseases. The key thing to stop the spread is people coming forward — if we drive stigma, it might mean people don’t come forward.” Members of London’s LGBTQ+ community agree. While Kasin is happy to be open about his sexuality and vaccination views on social media, many friends are not. “A lot of people I know say if they tested positive [for monkeypox] they wouldn’t feel comfortable to tell their employers. There’s definitely a fear of being treated differently because it’s through sex,” he says. Some are worried monkeypox could reignite stigma around gay communities like the HIV/AIDs epidemic 40 years ago  /  Corbis via Getty Images Josh Hopkins, 27, a trainee solicitor from west London, agrees. He had to call his local clinic 15 times on Monday before getting a vaccine appointment, and says there’s a fear and frustration that monkeypox isn’t being taken as seriously as other viruses because of the community affected. Just look at how information about the Covid jab was disseminated, he says, pointing to the nationwide drive to get the population jabbed, from celebrity videos to personal text messages. This time, his GP hasn’t been in touch to offer him the jab and half his friends didn’t know about London’s new walk-in centres and monkeypox clinics until he tweeted the number of the appointment line. “It feels like we’ve had to proactively seek [the vaccine] out ourselves.” Like Kasin, Hopkins has dozens of friends who queued for as long as four hours for a jab on Sunday, and they’re the lucky ones who live in London. The monkeypox jab is not available in other areas of the country yet, so a friend from Birmingham had to travel to the capital to have the jab last weekend. Experts are already warning that it might take more than a year to control this particular outbreak of monkeypox, because they and their colleagues “really missed the boat on being able to put a lid on the outbreak earlier”. “You’d think we’d have learnt lessons from Covid and tried to stop something new at the start,” says Hopkins, asking why GPs don’t seem to be actively promoting the vaccine yet, despite official guidance saying that “your local NHS services will contact you and offer you a vaccine”. But having this virus taken less seriously is only half Kasin and Hopkins’s concern. The other is who will take the blame if it escalates. As a gay man, Hopkins says he sees the dark side of today’s “horrible culture war against queer people” every day and has already seen “stupid tweets” about monkeypox being a “gay virus”. Anti-vaxxers have been sharing conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and the monkeypox vaccine being the Covid vaccine in disguise. “I know I’m early but I’m also anti-monkeypox jab,” outspoken actor Laurence Fox tweeted when the outbreak first emerged in May. And even the name monkeypox plays into conspiracy theorists’ hands. “That’s how it starts,” says Hopkins. “Information gets twisted and suddenly it becomes an anti-gay thing; that it’s our fault for being too promiscuous. This time next year, maybe it won’t have spread, but if it does, who are people who already hate the queer community going to blame? I don’t think it’s being fully weaponised just yet, but [these people] certainly tend to not need much of an excuse to do so.” Information gets twisted and suddenly it becomes an anti-gay thing Hopkins says the good thing about the queer community is they like to try to see the lighter side. Most of them have had lifetimes of jokes about promiscuity, so they’ve been reclaiming the jokes for themselves before others can, joking about how the vaccine queues are like another gay festival on social media. The upside is it’s highlighted how proactive gay men tend to be about their health. “I’ve spoke to my flatmates and family and clearly people aren’t that clued up [about monkeypox] outside the gay community.” So how likely are non-LGBTQ+ communities to find themselves exposed, should we all be getting the jab, and how likely are anti-vaxx theories around the Covid vaccine to affect potential uptake? Lawton says healthcare staff are some of those who need to be most careful when it comes to transmission. In 2018, the third victim of a monkeypox outbreak in the UK — a healthcare worker, 40, from Lancashire — blamed the NHS-provided gloves she was wearing while changing another monkeypox patient’s bedsheets at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. She also told reporters she may have passed the virus onto her husband, 50, after he woke up with spots covering his entire face. Experts say parents “should not be worried” about the rise in UK cases. Despite a school in Surbiton sending its reception class home over monkeypox fears earlier this month, cases in past outbreaks have predominantly been in adults. “Without any contact history with somebody that’s known or strongly felt to have monkeypox, and if you’ve got a rash at this time of year when we’ve seen lots of rashes from chickenpox and other things in children, hand, foot and mouth disease, then that’s what it’s likely to be,” Dr David Porter, paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said. When it comes to vaccination, Nye points out that most people over 50 in the UK will already have had the smallpox jab and therefore have protection. For the remaining under-50s, then, the main issues are to do with supply and personal choice, says Lawton. “Ultimately, it is a mild, self-limiting illness in most, so getting vaccinated should be a personal choice,” says Dr Nirusa Kumaran, a GP and founder of Elemental Health Clinic in south London. It is a mild, self-limiting illness in most, so getting vaccinated should be a personal choice The UK has ordered 130,000 doses of the vaccine, with the roll-out being run through sexual health services, and gay, bisexual and queer men are being prioritised for the jab — which is encouraged for men who have multiple sexual partners, participate in group sex or attend venues such as gay saunas. Vaccine uptake over the next few weeks will be crucial in determining how the outbreak plays out, and in the meantime, experts will continue to put pressure on the Government to boost resourcing for sexual health services. Meanwhile, most members of London’s MSM community are optimistic that their speed of mobilising will pay off. “We’re often demonised for ‘spreading’ something,” one member wrote this week in a tweet that’s been liked more than 700 times. But “we will actually be studied in the future as examples of how communities can use informal networks and information sharing to secure public health solutions.”  Hopefully, he’ll turn out to be right.",https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/monkeypox-gay-community-vaccine-cases-rising-b1015074.html,The Evening Standard

New monkeypox figures, due to be published on Monday afternoon, are expected to show a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases in the UK, currently at 20. Prof Fenton told The Standard: “Monkeypox cases are increasing in London and I’m expecting this to continue in the days ahead as awareness grows about symptoms and more cases are identified. “The cases we are seeing both in the UK and Europe are predominantly in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, suggesting that transmission is taking place within sexual networks, so we are asking men from these communities to be particularly alert to the symptoms and to seek help immediately.” LGBT groups demand action over monkeypox Spain reports first monkeypox-related death in Europe Monkeypox — ‘we need to fight the culture of blame’ BRANDPOST | PAID CONTENT How Uber drivers are sparking the electric car revolution He added: “I’d like to thank everyone who has come forward so far to get help for symptoms and also the staff working hard in sexual health services throughout the city. “The monkeypox virus spreads through close contact and we are advising everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact NHS 111 or to phone ahead before attending any healthcare settings.” Latest guidance from the UK Health Security Agency urges contacts of monkeypox cases at  high risk of having caught the infection to self-isolate for three weeks . It recommends that people who have had “unprotected direct contact or high-risk environmental contact” should take such action to restrict their contact with other people. This includes no travel, providing details for contact tracing and avoiding direct contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women and children under 12. Those who are considered at high risk of having caught monkeypox may have had household contact, sexual contact, or have changed an infected person’s bedding without wearing appropriate PPE. UKHSA also advises that they are offered a smallpox vaccine. The disease, first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse, and is caused by the monkeypox virus. It is a mild disease in most people and normally goes without treatment in two to four weeks. But it can be more dangerous in vulnerable people, such as those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children. One child was reportedly admitted to intensive care in London. The first case was confirmed in the UK on May 7. Public health chiefs say the virus has been detected in 15 nations outside Africa, including Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden, as well as the US, Canada, Australia and Israel. Belgium was the first country to announce a three-week quarantine for infected persons. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, warned that doctors are seeing community transmission in the UK, with cases predominantly being identified in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual or men who have sex with other men. Speaking to BBC One’s Sunday Morning, she said: “We will be releasing updated numbers tomorrow - over-the-weekend figures. “We are detecting more cases on a daily basis and I’d like to thank all of those people who are coming forward for testing to sexual health clinics, to the GPs and emergency department.” Asked if there is community transmission in the UK, she said: “Absolutely, we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country. “The community transmission is largely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.” Asked why it is being found in that demographic, she said: “That’s because of the frequent close contacts they may have. “We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don’t know, to come forward if they develop a rash.” Asked if people will need to to be vaccinated, she said: “There is no direct vaccine for monkeypox but we are using a form of smallpox vaccine - a third-generation, smallpox vaccine that is safe in individuals who are contacts of cases. “So we’re not using it in the general population. “We’re using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms, and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. “For contacts, (this) reduces your risk of developing disease, so that’s how we’re focusing our vaccination efforts at this point.” It comes as US president Joe Biden said that recent cases of monkeypox which have been identified in Europe and the United States are something “to be concerned about”.

Ifti Khan, Well Pharmacy Superintendent, said: “We know that this current spate of monkeypox is concerning, especially as we are still living with Covid, and the memory of lockdown is still so recent. “We would urge people to of course remain alert, but not to panic. “Chickenpox and monkeypox are similar in the way they are spread, via close contact and respiratory droplets, as well as direct contact with contaminated objects, but monkeypox is much rarer and spreads less easily. “The important thing to remember is that the chickenpox vaccine will not protect people from monkeypox, but it is still important to protect yourself against chickenpox, especially in adulthood when it can often be far more severe.”  Monkeypox is a  rare viral infection  usually associated with travel to West and central Africa.

He said the outbreak was showing signs of community transmission in some countries.  WHO recommends people with monkeypox isolate at home. Cases are still predominantly among men who have sex with men, the WHO added, although cases in women have been reported. The U.N. agency is working with organizations including UN AIDS and community groups to raise awareness and stop transmission. Post-exposure vaccination, including for health workers or close contacts, including sexual partners - ideally within four days of exposure - may be considered for some countries, WHO added.  The vaccines being used are designed against smallpox, a related, more dangerous virus that the world eradicated in 1980, but also work to protect against monkeypox, studies have shown. Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms, the UKHSA said. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually transmitted infection but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash.

WHO Europe has forecast just over 27,000 monkeypox cases in 88 countries by August 2, up from 17,800 cases in nearly 70 countries at the latest count. Cases of the virus, which has been present in parts of Africa for decades, first began to be reported outside countries where it is endemic in May. It generally causes moderate symptoms, including fever, fatigue and painful skin lesions. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Reuters that health officials “have to get in front of this”. “It’s clear the window of opportunity for doing so is closing,” she added.

Despite a majority of committee members voting against the move, WHO Director-General declared an emergency anyway. Health experts have urged authorities to ramp up vaccination, testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures for those infected. Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva and chair of the WHO Europe advisory group, said that transmission is “clearly unchecked”. The group has modelled three scenarios for the coming months. These include “sustained transmission”, either between men who have sex with men; beyond these groups and possibly into more vulnerable populations, like children, or between humans and animals. The latter scenario risks the establishment of a monkeypox reservoir in animals in new countries, as it has in parts of west and central Africa, said Prof Flahault. Ongoing transmission could also lead to mutations that make the virus more efficient at spreading in humans, scientists said. The most likely route of monkeypox transmission is close physical contact, touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, or touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs. Sexual intercourse is thought to expose people to a higher risk of contracting the disease as, although it is not known to be sexually transmitted, the close physical contact involved means exposure is more likely.

Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said health authorities were monitoring flu cases “very carefully”. The UK has not experienced a proper flu season since 2020, as successive Covid lockdowns helped to stem transmission of the virus. However, experts fear that waning population immunity could leave the country vulnerable to a bad wave this winter. Speaking at a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine on Thursday, Dr Hopkins noted that Australia has experienced its worst flu wave in five years. “It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups, so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave,” she said.

According to the UKHSA, monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people and the overall risk to the UK population remains low. Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should contact NHS 111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns, it said.

The Government has stocks of the smallpox vaccine which is being offered to very close contacts of those affected. Those at the highest risk of contracting the disease are being asked to self-isolate at home for 21 days, with others warned to be on the lookout for symptoms. Transmission between people is occurring in the UK, with a large proportion of cases identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Health authorities in Europe, North America, Israel and Australia have identified more than 100 cases of monkeypox in recent days.  Health officials are still investigating, but a top adviser to the World Health Organisation said this week that the leading theory is that monkeypox was likely spread after sexual activity at two recent raves in Europe. Dr David Heymann, who chairs WHO's expert advisory group on infectious hazards, said monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with someone already infected with the disease, and that “it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission.”  Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.

,,,"T he past three weeks have seen a  new and unusual outbreak of the monkeypox virus emerge in the UK and internationally.  You may hear comparisons being drawn between Covid-19 and monkeypox after what has been a difficult few years for us all. But it’s important to know that  monkeypox is less transmissible than Covid-19  and even less so than chickenpox. It is unpleasant but reassuringly it is generally mild and doesn’t usually spread easily from person to person. Nevertheless, we must do all we can to suppress it, to avoid it becoming established here. As more monkeypox cases are being detected,  several epidemiological links are becoming apparent including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men,  many of whom have links to, or live in London. But these early links are evolving rapidly, and other groups may be affected soon. That’s why we’re advising everyone to  be aware of the symptoms  — monkeypox can start with a temperature, swollen glands and a headache, and a rash of spots or blisters can appear on the body, including the face and genitals. If you have any of these symptoms, you should limit your contact with others and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service as soon as possible, but please phone ahead before attending in person. As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma is great and does great harm. It prevents those who may be at risk from coming forward for testing, and people may withhold important information about their medical history for fear of being judged. Monkeypox has never been, and is by no means a “gay disease”, nor is it a sexually transmitted infection. In this recent outbreak, monkeypox is primarily being spread by close skin-to-skin physical contact with someone who has the spots or blisters, including during sex. It can also be passed on by touching used clothing, bedding or towels so it can sometimes spread to house mates and family. As we have learned from responding to other epidemics, including Covid-19 and  HIV/Aids,  it’s important that we continue to use the right language to describe monkeypox. It’s crucial that we learn the lessons from previous pandemics. Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact tracing efforts — you are helping us limit the spread of this infection.

Major monkeypox update as cases rise and scientists identify new painful symptoms,Terri-Ann Williams,"13:27, 29 Jul 2022","MONKEYPOX cases have risen again in the UK as scientists identify new, painful symptoms. Up to July 28 there have been 2,469 confirmed cases of  the bug , new data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has revealed. On top of that, there are also 77 highly probable infections, bringing the total to 2,546. London  is still being hit hard by the outbreak and has 1,778 of the infections - up from 1,699 earlier this week. It's followed by the South East where there are 204 cases and the  North West , where there is 126. The East of England has 99, the  West Midlands , 69, the South West, 47,  Yorkshire  and the Humber, 44,  East Midlands  31 and the  North East  has 26. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, UEA said: ""Although the total number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in England are continuing to rise the number of new cases being reported in each week does now appear to be falling.   ""But there is a long way to go before we can relax as the risk of another surge in cases remains.” The rise in cases comes as a  new study  published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) revealed those catching the bug aren't displaying typical symptoms.

People can also catch monkeypox from an infected person’s bed sheets or towels, or from their coughs or sneezes.  Dr Makki said: “Monkeypox cases continue to rise, with the virus being passed on predominantly in interconnected sexual networks.  “Before you have sex, go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters.  “If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician.” The UKHSA previously warned that monkeypox patients  should use condoms  for 12 weeks after they’ve had the bug.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19360661/major-monkeypox-update-cases-rise-painful-symptoms/,The Sun
‘Monkeypox’ patient snapped on packed train reveals he DOESN’T have virus after photo goes viral,Vanessa Chalmers,"16:43, 2 Aug 2022","A MAN who was vilified for getting on a packed train with ""monkeypox"" has revealed he doesn't actually have the virus. The man - with a rash on his legs - was photographed by a doctor in  Madrid  who was concerned for the welfare of other passengers. Dr Arturo Henriques, 32, claimed he spoke to the passenger, who didn't care that he was spreading the virus. But the man accused has since spoken to local media and categorically denied that the conversation took place. He said he suffers with a condition called neurofibromatosis, the symptoms of which may be mistaken for other rashes.

He said:  ""I don't have monkeypox and I didn't speak to him [Dr Henriques] at any time."" The man says if he had been by Dr Henriques, he would have explained he had neurofibromatosis - as he often does to other people who are curious.  The man's legs are covered in a rash - which looks similar to the  tell-tale monkeypox rash . But it is in fact the symptoms of neurofibromatosis, a condition which causes tumours to grow along the nerves. The skin may have birthmark or freckle-type patches.  Get to know the monkeypox rash The monkeypox rash comes a few days after a person feels unwell with  symptoms  such as a fever, headache, muscle aches, back ache, chills or exhaustion. The rash tends to start on the face and hands before spreading to the limbs.  But in the current outbreak, experts have said the rash is more commonly  appearing on the gentials  than before.  The rash initially looks a little like chickenpox, and there may be many lesions or just a couple. Then the marks on the skin turn into pus-filled blisters. Experts wrote in the British Journal of Dermatology the most common skin lesions are  rare pseudo-pustules . With standard pustules, most of the time you can scrape away the top layer of the lesion, in order to get to the pus. But with pseudo-pustules, they are white and solid. Over time, these pseudo-pustules can become necrotic and lead to ulcers. And these blisters tend to just be in one location, rather than spread across the body. The NHS website says monkeypox can be passed on from person to person through any close physical contact with blisters or scabs. It can spread up until the rash has completely healed - when all scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed. Monkeypox can also be transmitted through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the virus. And even the coughs or sneezes of a person with monkeypox can be infectious. But the NHS adds: ""Anyone can get monkeypox. Though currently most cases have been in men who are  gay, bisexual or have sex with other men ."" The virus is generally passing between people during sexual activity. It has led health chiefs to warn men at risk of catching monkeypox to momentarily  limit sexual partners .  However, it does not mean it cannot spread to anyone outside the gay community, and it is not officially known as an  STI . Anyone can be infected with  monkeypox , regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity or sexuality.  But currently, it is spreading among the gay community. Spain  has been particularly badly-hit by the disease, where health chiefs have recorded 4,298 cases so far, and  two deaths .",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19398971/horrifying-image-train-passenger-riddled-monkeypox/,The Sun

Monkeypox rash Monkeypox causes a rash a few days after flu-like symptoms, such as achey muscles and joints, a headache and fever. The rash initially looks a little like chickenpox, and there may be many lesions or just a couple. Then the marks on the skin turn into pus-filled blisters. Experts wrote in the British Journal of Dermatology the most common skin lesions are  rare pseudo-pustules . With standard pustules, most of the time you can scrape away the top layer of the lesion, in order to get to the pus. But with pseudo-pustules, they are white and solid. Over time, these pseudo-pustules can become necrotic and lead to ulcers, before scabbing over. Previously monkeypox has been known to start as a rash on the face and hands before spreading on the body. But dermatologists have said that a study of new cases suggests the blisters tend to be in one location of the body. The rash is more commonly  appeared on the gentials  than before. People may mistake the rash on their genital area for an STI such as herpes or syphilis, experts have warned. Health bosses warn that if you have any symptoms of monkeypox, to go to a sexual health clinic. In the UK, you can call 111.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19447274/i-was-thrown-off-flight-over-eczema-monkeypox/,The Sun
New monkeypox skin symptoms identified – as ‘more deaths expected’,Terri-Ann Williams,"0:01, 3 Aug 2022","CASES of monkeypox are continuing to rise globally, with experts warning that new skin symptoms have been identified. Typical  signs of the illness  usually include a fever - along with swelling of the lymph nodes. But a new review of 185 cases published in the British Journal of Dermatology has found otherwise. Medics have now stated that the most common signs of this outbreak are rare pseudo-pustules. These are similar in appearance to pustules, with the main difference being that they are white and solid. With standard pustules, most of the time you can scrape away the top layer of the lesion, in order to get to the pus. However, with pseudo-pustules this isn't possible and experts say that these lesions can lead to ulcers. The medics state that this discovery is 'important' as very few diseases produce this type of reaction. Dr Ignacio García Doval, the coordinator of the research from the Spanish Academy of Dermatology said a crucial part of the outbreak is having as much information as possible. ""Our research shows that the symptoms of the current outbreak are unusual and there is evidence that this is due to skin-to-skin contact during sex.

""Monkeypox is often described as causing pustules, pus-filled lesions, but in this outbreak, the main skin symptom is actually pseudo-pustules, white, solid papules which look like pustules, but which don’t contain any pus.  ""This feature is very rare in other diseases, so is a very clear sign of monkeypox."" He added that no patient in the research died and that hospitalisation was uncommon. However he added that the  disease  is very uncomfortable and can have long-term consequences, including scarring in visible areas. The study comes as  two deaths have been recorded  in Europe. In the UK cases have risen up to  2,469 confirmed infections on July 28. Medics have also recorded 77 ""highly probable"" infections, bringing the total to 2,546. But  Spain  has been particularly badly-hit by the disease, where health chiefs have recorded 4,298 cases so far. Now medics have said more deaths are expected as the bug continues to spread. Senior emergency officer at World Health Organization (WHO) Europe, Catherine Smallwood said: ""Our goal needs to be on interrupting transmission quickly in Europe and stopping this outbreak. ""With the continued spread of monkeypox in Europe, we will expect to see more deaths.

Urgent monkeypox warning amid fears virus will become endemic in the UK,Terri-Ann Williams,"15:59, 5 Aug 2022","AN urgent monkeypox warning has been issued amid fears the virus could become endemic in the UK. Around 2,468  infections  have been confirmed across the country - with at least 77 'highly probable' cases. An endemic state refers to a disease or condition regularly found amongst a population. While medics at the UK Health Security have urged Brits to stay calm, the US this week declared a  public health emergency  over  the virus . The declaration came after the  World Health Organization (WHO)  also called the outbreak a global emergency. Now, both politicians and LGBT+ groups have demanded the government increase its efforts to help curb the spread. Vaccines have already been rolled out in some parts, but the group has said this now must become a priority. In a letter penned to health secretary  Steve Barclay , the group said: ""We cannot afford to allow monkeypox to become endemic in the UK. ""Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. We ask that you do so urgently.” Signed by the LGBT+ groups for Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Scottish National Party, along with sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, the group said communication on the outbreak is key.

""Messaging must reach communities at high risk of acquiring monkeypox, through targeted messaging on apps, online and in the queer media. “Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK."" They added that there are 'worries' that vaccinations could become a driver of inequality - especially when there is an undersupply of jabs. “It is time to get improved systems and more purchasing of this much-needed vaccine,"" the said. The Terrence Higgins Trust said urgent political action is needed to get hold of the rise in cases.

"UK monkeypox cases rise to 2,432 as Brits told ‘check yourself for symptoms before sex’",Vanessa Chalmers,"16:35, 26 Jul 2022","THE UK monkeypox outbreak has grown again and Brits are being warned to dealy having sex until after they’ve done a symptom check.  Up to 25 July, there have been 2,367 confirmed cases, a rise of 159 in the space of four days. There are also 65 “highly probable cases”, taking the total to 2,432. The UK Health and Security Agency said some labs are now testing samples for orthopox, a group of viruses that includes  monkeypox . If the test result is positive, it is considered highly likely the person has monkeypox and they are tested specifically for the bug. Dr Sophia Makki, National Incident Director at UKHSA, warned people to check for  symptoms of monkeypox  - namely a rash or blisters on the skin - before having  sex . Close physical contact enables the virus to spread, hence why people are picking it up through sexual activity. But it is not defined as a  sexually tramismitted disease. People can also catch monkeypox from an infected person’s bed sheets or towels, or from their coughs or sneezes.  Dr Makki said: “Monkeypox cases continue to rise, with the virus being passed on predominantly in interconnected sexual networks.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “Before you have sex, go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters.  “If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician.” The UKHSA previously warned that monkeypox patients  should use condoms  for 12 weeks after they’ve had the bug. The agency said there is a “body of evidence” showing monkeypox is present in the semen of people infected. Dr Hugh Adler said transmission in households is ""possible, but not common, and certainly not like we would see with COVID, influenza, measles etc"". An expert in clinical science at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, he told The Sun: ""I think the vaccine campaign really needs to ramp up. ""We can still bring this to a close, but it will get more and more challenging the higher the number of cases we see."" The NHS has launched  a vaccination programme , centred around the outbreak epicentre of London, to protect those most at risk. This includes men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men.  More than 95 per cent of the monkeypox cases so far in the UK have been in this group - with the same trend seen globally. Some 100,000 jabs will be available. Dr Makki said: “Vaccination will further strengthen our monkeypox response and so we urge all those who are eligible for the vaccine to take it up when offered.  “It will help protect yourself and others you have had close contact with.  “While the infection is mild for many, it can cause severe symptoms and hospitalisation in some.  “Please remember that the vaccine may not provide complete protection against monkeypox, so it is still important to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and call 111 or a sexual health clinic if you develop any.” The World Health Organization (WHO) said the monkeypox virus has reached more than 70 countries,  declaring it a global health emergency.   The surge in monkeypox infections is unusual because it is outside the West and Central African countries where it is endemic. The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days. Rashes subsequently appear on the face, palms of hands and soles of the feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs. The UKHSA updated its  official list of monkeypox symptoms  in light of new evidence. Experts said that just a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus and surrounding area, lesions in the mouth, and symptoms of anal rectal pain or bleeding can be a sign. They highlighted that this is a red flag especially if the individual has recently had a new sexual partner.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19325014/uk-monkeypox-cases-rise-brits-check-symptoms-before-sex/,The Sun
I mistook monkeypox for Covid – I’ve never been in so much pain,Isabel Shaw,"10:05, 10 Aug 2022","A MAN who caught monkeypox first believed he had Covid before experiencing agonising symptoms that made him fear for his life.  Usually,  monkeypox  causes mild symptoms, with most people who catch the virus making a full recovery within a few weeks of testing positive.  But Harun Tulunay, a 35-year-old charity worker, experienced extreme symptoms which left him hospitalised for almost two weeks.  Harun is one of the 2,768 confirmed monkeypox infections across the UK, since an outbreak of the virus across at least 50 countries started in May. Last month, health bodies estimated the outbreak was doubling in size about every two weeks, but the number of new infections has dropped in recent weeks. Harun, who lives in  London , first started to display  flu -like symptoms back in early June, such as high fever, chills and muscle aches. After having recently caught  Covid  he was “convinced” he had had the virus again, he told The Sun. “But every test I did came back negative.” A few days later, the charity worker developed a red and white rash on his body that resembled an allergic reaction, which he said was “nothing like the monkeypox pictures you see online”. It wasn’t until a few days later that he also noticed a painless spot on his nose which he assumed was a mosquito-like bite or pimple.  Harun works in sexual health so is well versed in monkeypox and its symptoms, but he had never seen his rash or spot associated with the disease and so didn’t think he could have it. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence A few days later, Harun's health took a turn for the worse as his fever reached 40C. “No amount of painkillers would ease the pain,” he said.  Despite his symptoms, Harun was struggling to be taken seriously by medics, who eventually gave him penicillin for tonsillitis - which he didn’t have. There was no suggestion from healthcare professionals that he had could be suffering monkeypox. Harun is living with  HIV , a virus which can damage cells in the immune system.  He takes medication which reduces the amount of HIV in his blood to a very low level, which keeps his immune system working and prevents illness.   His blood tests suggested he had a robust immune system at the time of his monkeypox infection. However, his GP suggested that his symptoms may be an indication that his medication isn’t working, which Harun said was “really scary”. It was at this point that Harun went to his sexual health clinic who suggested it could be monkeypox and sent him to A&E to get tested. “You never believe it could happen to you. I work in sexual health and I still didn’t think I could have it,” he said.  It was at this point that Harun developed swollen tonsils and a very sore throat.   “I couldn’t breathe, swallow or speak,” he said.  “I vividly remember calling up the hospital and crying in pain."" Harun was finally referred to hospital where he was put into isolation.  His test confirmed he had monkeypox, and only then did lesions often associated with monkeypox begin to appear on his hands, legs, and feet. ""My throat was covered,"" he said, explaining that the lesion on his nose was bigger and became infected. Harun was transferred to a specialist hospital for treatment with an experimental drug that works for  smallpox , a related virus. “I was scared I would die alone in my hospital room,” he said. “I’d never been in so much pain in my life.” “I remember looking at a water bottle and crying because I couldn’t drink it,” he added.  Harun has now made a full recovery and has since called for the government to ramp up the vaccine process to get more people jabbed. “Many people can be symptomless and not display spots in obvious places. Or they may be very small like mine,"" he explained. “These people can easily and unwillingly end up passing the virus onto others. The faster we get the vaccine the faster we can stop it spreading."" Harun also said that many people still mistakenly believe monkeypox is a gay disease.  ""Just because the disease is currently impacting the gay community, it doesn't mean only gay people can catch it,"" he explained.  ""I've had several straight people and straight couples contact me on social media to share their own experiences of monkeypox."" Last week, both politicians and LGBT+ groups demanded the government increase its efforts to help curb the spread.

Medics have declared the outbreak a  global health emergency , with 2,208 cases having been detected in the UK so far. In the US there are currently 2,891 cases - with New York and California being the worst hit. New guidance issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged Brits to look out for any new lesions. Experts said that just a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus and surrounding area, lesions in the mouth, and symptoms of anal rectal pain or bleeding can be a sign. They highlighted that this is a red flag especially if the individual has recently had a new sexual partner. In most cases, infection usually starts with  symptoms  such as a fever and headache. Some people will also experience muscle aches, back ache, chills or exhaustion. This is usually followed by a rash a few days later. Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at UKHSA said medics are continuing to see cases that have been passed on primarly through close or sexual contact.

For many people symptoms can be mild but for some people, hospital treatment may be required.” There have been no deaths in the UK as of yet from the outbreak and medics said that most people can manage their symptoms at home. The update from the UKHSA comes after a study in The New England Journal of Medicine last week found that many who have  the bug  were experiencing symptoms not recognised. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Experts today said you should also look out for lesions in the mouth or around the anus  “These symptoms include single  genital lesions  and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. One in ten people had only a single skin lesion in the genital area, and 15 per cent had anal and/or rectal pain, Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said. The findings back those of a recent analysis of London cases, published in the  British Medical Journal. It said of the 54 cases, ""skin lesions on genitals appeared to be more common in this outbreak"", while fever and tiredness was less so. The concern is that these symptoms are being confused for other  sexually transmitted infections  (STIs), such as genital warts or  syphilis , or even cold sores. When cases slip through the net it makes containing the spread of the disease more challenging. The paper said: “The clinical symptoms are similar to those of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and can easily lead to misdiagnosis.  “In some people, anal and oral symptoms have led to people being admitted to hospital for management of pain and difficulties swallowing.  “This is why it’s so important that these new clinical symptoms be recognised and healthcare professionals be educated on how to identify and manage the disease – misdiagnosis can slow detection and thus hinder efforts to control the spread of the virus.  “The study will therefore lead to increased rates of diagnosis when persons from at-risk groups present with traditional STI symptoms.” Monkeypox is not an STI but is predominately spread through sex, given that it it transmits with close skin contact.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19313169/monkeypox-official-symptoms-cases-continue-rise/,The Sun

These signs include issues with their stools and rashes in the tissue lining the mouth. Other patients have said rashes have caused them to experience pain in the anus and rectum and in some cases, rectal bleeding has occurred. Many have also had painful inflammation of the rectal lining - with others experiencing the sensation of having to poo when their bowels are actually empty. The World Health Organisation's Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""It’s now clear that there is an unusual situation, meaning even the virus is behaving unusually from how it used to behave in the past."" Details from the CDC report state that for some people who have the bug, rashes have been either 'scattered or localised' to a specific part of the body.

A vaccine rollout has begun to try and keep a lid on the outbreak - which shows no signs of slowing. The  monkepox  caseload has gone up by 14 per cent in  three days , the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed. An additional 201 cases have been detected between July 4 and 7, bringing the total to 1,552.  The outbreak, which has been rumbling on since May, shows “no signs of a decline”, UKHSA said. Almost every identified person with the virus has been a gay or bisexual man. There is no evidence as of yet that  the bug  has spilled outside of this group, UKHSA said.  A vaccination programme is beginning, and sexual health services will offer the vaccine to anyone considered to be at higher risk of exposure.  “This includes people with a recent history of multiple partners, participating in group sex, attending sex on premises venues, or have recently had a bacterial sexually transmitted infection,” health chiefs said. Some 17 per cent of patients who have given information said they had been to a sex party of some kind, new data reveals.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Experts have said that monkeypox  is not a “gay disease” , and more likely a mere coincidence the virus has infilitrated this community.  Monkeypox  can be spread by skin-to-skin contact and investigations show people are picking it up through sex. Its most characteristic symptoms is a  rash , causing blisters that scab over time. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “It’s concerning that we are continuing to see the outbreak grow and we urge the public to do all they can to help us slow the spread. “If you’ve recently had new or multiple sexual partners, please be vigilant to the  symptoms of monkeypox , and be aware that many of the cases we’re seeing are finding only a single, or few, lesions. “If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact.  “Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you’ve been reviewed by a clinician. “To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners. “If you are called forward for vaccination, we strongly recommend that you take it.” The average age of those infected is 36 years old, with London becoming the epicentre (75 per cent of cases). Monkeypox is a zoonotic infection that occurs mostly in West and Central Africa.  The handful of previous cases in the UK have been either imported from countries where monkeypox is usually found. But for the first time, the virus is spreading through parts of the population.  The rise in the UK comes as the US has also now recorded 700 cases of the bug.

New monkeypox symptoms revealed as experts warn the bug ‘has no borders’,Vanessa Chalmers,"22:00, 21 Jul 2022","NEW monkeypox symptoms have been revealed by scientists who warn the bug “has no borders”. Outbreaks across the globe were sparked in May and experts are still grappling with containing them. Today, the largest review of cases so far, spanning 16 countries, has been published.  It’s already apparent that  monkeypox  causes a flu-like illness, with  a rash spreading  from the face around the body in the days following. The rash looks similar to chickenpox, with the small spots (or lesions) becoming blisters before scabbing over. But reporting in the  The New England Journal of Medicine , scientists said many infected people were seen with “symptoms not recognised” by current monkeypox definitions. “These symptoms include single  genital lesions  and sores on the mouth or anus,” the paper said. One in ten people had only a single skin lesion in the genital area, and 15 per cent had anal and/or rectal pain, Dr John Thornhill, a sexual health consultant and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said. The findings back those of a recent analysis of London cases, published in the  British Medical Journal. It said of the 54 cases, ""skin lesions on genitals appeared to be more common in this outbreak"", while fever and tiredness was less so.

Dr Thornhill said: “[Monkeypox] can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact.  “However, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity - mainly, but not exclusively, amongst men who have sex with men.” The study also found “a large proportion of the semen samples tested from people with monkeypox”. It comes after UK health officials warned of a “body of evidence” showing semen can contain monkeypox. It is not clear whether this means the virus can be spread via sex, however, Brits have been told to  use condoms for at least 12 weeks  after recovering.  Professor Chloe Orkin, Queen Mary University of London and Director of the SHARE collaborative, warned: “Viruses know no borders and monkey pox infections have now been described in 70 countries and in more than 13,000 people.” Vaccination programmes are being rolled out in order to protect the most vulnerable groups. The disease is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men, including more than 95 per cent of the cases in the UK. It comes as the NHS steps up its vaccination programme in London - the epicentre of the UK’s outbreak.  Of the 2,137  confirmed cases in the UK, 1,492 are in London. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine on Tuesday. And now, NHS England said thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted about getting their jab. Those at highest risk, such as primary contacts and healthcare workers, will be invited to come forward for a jab at one of the 18 clinics.  Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: “Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too. “As we have done with the most successful Covid vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19275340/new-monkeypox-symptoms-revealed/,The Sun
Second monkeypox death now confirmed in Europe as Spain sees another fatality amid rising cases across the globe,Lara Wildenberg,"11:43, 30 Jul 2022","A SECOND monkeypox fatality in Europe has been confirmed today. Another patient has died of the  highly-infectious virus  in Spain after  Europe's first monkeypox death  yesterday evening. Spain  has been particularly badly-hit by the disease, where health chiefs have recorded 4,298 cases so far. No further details are known about the people who have died. But the vast majority of those diagnosed with the disease in the country have been men. Just 64 female patients have been treated. The earliest cases, recorded in May , were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria. Last week, the World Health Organisation  declared monkeypox a global health emergency , after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. That means it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed. The WHO Director General said the risk globally was ""moderate"" but the health committee had decided to declare an emergency anyway. At the time of their announcement, more than 16,000 people had been infected with monkeypox and five people had died. Now, more than 19,000 cases have been confirmed with 1,778 infections in London alone as of yesterday. In the whole of the UK, cases have risen up to  2,469 confirmed infections on July 28. Medics have also recorded 77 ""highly probable"" infections, bringing the total to 2,546. Traditionally, symptoms of monkeypox have included  a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. Some victims also suffer from a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet. But, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. And instead of widespread rashes, some patients saw scattered or localized lesions in areas other than the face, hands, or feet. The majority of cases, about 98 percent, have been among gay and bisexual men who have sex with men, the WHO said. However, medics recently delivered  the baby of a mum suffering with the virus .

How many monkeypox cases are there in the US?,Tereza Shkurtaj,"20:45, 4 Aug 2022","MONKEYPOX cases in the United States are on the rise as the country remains on high alert.  Due to the recent rise in cases, the Biden administration has classified the situation as a public health emergency.  How many monkeypox cases are there in the US? On May 18, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention learned that  one United States resident  had a confirmed case of monkeypox after returning to the US from Canada.  Since then, a  total of 6,617 individuals  have tested positive in the US for monkeypox,  according to CDC data .  With the numbers continuing the rise, President Joe Biden has declared the situation a public health emergency. “In light of all of these developments and the evolving circumstances on the ground, I want to make an announcement today that I will be declaring a public health emergency,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told reporters, via  CNBC .  The decision comes one month after WHO declared monkeypox a global health emergency after more than 26,000 cases were reported in 87 countries.  What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is a rare disease that causes several symptoms and a distinctive bumpy rash. According to the  CDC , the first human case of monkeypox dates back to 1970 and was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Some of the most common symptoms include:  People infected with monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Is monkeypox deadly?  Monkeypox can last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks, and while  WHO  says the monkeypox virus is similar to human smallpox, it can still be fatal.  So far, there have been five reported deaths worldwide, according to the University of Minnesota's  Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy .  Is there a vaccine for monkeypox?  While there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox in the United States, Biden stated that the smallpox vaccine is effective and that the country has enough “to deal with the likelihood of a problem,"" according to  USA Today .  “I just don't think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with Covid-19,” Biden said during a separate press conference.  When asked if Americans can expect a similar response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he stated that it ""doesn't seem to be a need for any kind of extra efforts beyond what's going on,"" but added that ""people should be careful.""   At this time, it remains unclear if a specific monkeypox vaccine is in development. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18663438/how-many-monkeypox-cases-us/,The Sun
Urgent warning as monkeypox is starting to infect children – the 7 signs you must never ignore,Terri-Ann Williams,"11:18, 30 Jun 2022","PARENTS have been warned to look out for signs of monkeypox in their children as cases continue to rise. Infections have now hit more than 3,400 globally and medics say if it keeps spreading, the bug could reach the most vulnerable. The latest data from the UK states that there are currently  1,076 cases  across the country, a jump of 32 per cent on last week. In the US , infections have also been climbing with 351 being recorded by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC). So far, experts investigating the outbreak have said cases have been in adults, with the majority being  detected in men . Now the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that it is investigating reports of infections in two children in the UK as well as kids in France and Spain. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women."" Monkeypox  is spread through close physical contact, meaning it's easily transmissible. While  symptoms  of the illness are the same in adults and kids, children are at higher risk of dying from the bug, as their immune systems are not yet fully developed. It's important that you know the  signs to look out for , especially in little ones, who might not be able to explain how they are feeling.

Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"", Dr Hopkins said, and are like ""a viral illness"". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. ""It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,"" Dr Hopkins said. ""They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious."" Medics  say the fatality rate in children is between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. The  NHS  states that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. It's important that  parents  also look out for signs that their child is feeling generally unwell.

The warning comes after the WHO declared  monkeypox  a global health emergency on Sunday as cases worldwide exceeded 19,000. The majority of the cases, about 98 percent, have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, the WHO said. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has cautioned those at risk should take steps to protect themselves and others. ""That means making safe choices for yourself and others, for men who have sex with men,"" Ghebreyesus said. ""This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners."" The WHO's latest warning contradicts those from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which only suggests avoiding skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that could be monkeypox. Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO Regional Director for Europe, has warned that ""vaccines alone won't end the monkeypox outbreak"". ""While vaccination may be available to some people with higher exposure risks, it is not a silver bullet,"" Dr Kluge said.

On Thursday, there had been 1,235 confirmed cases of  the virus  in the UK, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said today.  It compares to the  1,076  reported up to June 26, when experts warned the infected to stay indoors. Anyone can get  monkeypox , which is characterised by a nasty blistering  rash . But at the moment, it is  spreading  among the gay community, with almost every case a male. The hotspot is London, where 77 per cent of cases have been confirmed, data published by UKHSA today reveals. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “The monkeypox outbreak continues to grow.  “Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other  men who have sex with men. ” Ms Shepherd warned those who have plans over London Pride to enjoy so safely, echoing comments made  by local health chiefs in the city. She said: “This weekend, let’s enjoy  Pride  safely – before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “Please don’t attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell. If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested.  “Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks – especially if you are having sex with someone new.” She also urged people to keep the contact details of any sexual partners, in the event it will be needed for contact tracing. Last week Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UKHSA, said anyone attending “large events over the summer” to be aware of the symptoms.  The monkeypox outbreak is unusual because there have only been some seven cases in the UK in the years between 2018 and 2021. The sudden influx of cases coincides with a global spike. And experts are now concerned it will coincide with a  new Covid wave , and an unusually early flu season. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at UKHSA said she thought this year ""will be even more challenging than normal"",  The Telegraph  reported. The agency is watching Australia - in its winter - ""very, very carefully"" to predict what will happen in the UK. “They have had their worst influenza season for more than five years,"" Dr Susan said at a briefing, adding it started earlier. “While we normally don’t see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October – that’s what we’re planning for,"" she said. Dr Hopkins said at least one wave of  Covid  is expected this autumn-winter, and monkeypox should be expected to spread for at least ""the next six months"". Monkeypox does not spread easily between people. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth). Monkeypox can spread from person to person through: The illness begins with: Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops. It often begins in the face before spreading to other parts of the body.  The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off. An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.

I’m an expert – here’s everything you need to know about monkeypox in children,Vanessa Chalmers,"15:39, 4 Aug 2022","EXPERTS have revealed what parents need to know about the monkeypox outbreak, after cases in children have been confirmed. Four kids  in the  US  and one under 15-year-old male in the UK have been struck. The number of cases is very small compared to the larger epidemic, in which a few thousand people have been reported. But experts have warned that children under eight are at “high risk” of severe disease if they catch monkeypox. Monkeypox  usually causes a mild disease of flu-like symptoms and  a rash  which gets better on its own. It has a fatality rate of three to six per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Two deaths  have been reported in  Spain . Here is everything you need to know about the risk to your kids: Yes, children can get monkeypox. Jimmy Whitworth, an Emeritus Professor, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: “Anyone who comes into close contact with a case can become infected."" Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Monkeypox can be spread through close skin-to-skin contact or through a secondary surface like clothing, bedding, or towels. It is transmitting differently in Western countries compared to  Africa  - where the virus is endemic. It is mostly spreading via close contact, typically during sex, throught  Europe , the US,  Canada  and elsewhere. Gay and bisexual men make up the majority of cases - but this does not mean it cannot spread outside this group. Dr Hugh Adler, an expert in clinical science at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: “Infection in children is relatively more common in African countries, where it typically is acquired via contact with wildlife. “If a high number of cases were seen in children, this would suggest that household or community transmission was widespread.  “Fortunately this is not currently the case in the UK or elsewhere in the current outbreak. “Household transmission is possible, but not common, certainly not like we would see with  Covid , influenza, measles etc.” The World Health Organizations says that severe cases occur more often in young children. The CDC has warned of preliminary evidence that has suggested children below the age of eight could develop a more severe reaction to the virus. Young children with eczema and other skin conditions, and children with immunocompromising conditions may also be at more risk for severe illness, according to the  CDC . In rare cases, the virus can result in encephalitis (brain swelling), pneumonia, sepsis, vision loss and more, the CDC reported. It is not clear why kids are more at risk - as are pregnant women and immunocompromised adults.  The most recent cases are in the state of Indiana, where health authorities reported two cases on August 2.  The  first two infected children  were a toddler in California and a non-US resident from the UK who was tested in the Washington DC area. Data from the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) also reveals that one under 15-year-old caught the bug sometime since the outbreak started in May. Kids and the public generally are at a low risk of catching the virus, health bosses say.  Prof Whitworth said that monkeypox is unlikely to cause an epidemic in the general population because “most people do not have very close contact with many different people”.  And Prof Adler said that if a child is infected, it is unlikely they’d be in school spreading it to other youngsters. “Sick children (including with monkeypox) would typically be kept at home rather than being out playing with other kids, indeed they probably would feel quite unwell in the early stages, and then be in isolation if they'd tested positive,"" he said.  If someone comes down with monkeypox, their first symptoms are likely to be similar to flu. They may have a high temperature, headache, muscle aches, swollen glands and exhaustion. A distinctive rash follows, which can be confused for chickenpox, scabies or hand, foot and mouth disease. But what start as flat, slightly raised spots turn into pus-filled blisters. These eventually burst or ulcerate and turn into scabs. The NHS says it’s unlikely to be monkeypox unless you have not been in close contact with someone who has the virus, or you have not recently travelled to west or central Africa.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19419742/everything-to-know-monkeypox-children/,The Sun
Brit holiday warning over monkeypox outbreak across Canaries as 100 cases are confirmed on holiday islands,Imogen Braddick,"17:50, 21 Jul 2022","NEARLY 100 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed on the popular holiday islands of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Fuerteventura.

Experts have warned that although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it could be  passed on through skin-to-skin contact during sex . Many known patients are gay men who were tested after going to STI clinics, the WHO said. Health chiefs warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . In the UK, the NHS is stepping up its vaccination programme against monkeypox in London as more supplies of a jab come on stream. On Tuesday, the UK Health Security Agency said it had procured 100,000 more doses of an effective vaccine as monkeypox cases continue to rise. As of July 18, there were 2,137 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2,050 in England and the majority in London. Steve Russell, NHS director of vaccinations, said: ""While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus. ""On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible."" US officials have also ordered more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses - with several million more on order for the months ahead.  The WHO's emergency committee met on Thursday to consider for the second time within weeks whether to declare monkeypox a global crisis. African officials said they are already treating the continent's epidemic as an emergency.  But experts said the mild version of monkeypox in Europe, North America and beyond makes an emergency declaration unnecessary - even if the virus can't be stopped. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19276866/brit-holiday-warning-monkeypox-outbreak-canaries/,The Sun
New monkeypox symptoms discovered – the 11 signs you must not ignore,Terri-Ann Williams,"13:49, 5 Jul 2022","NEW monkeypox symptoms have been discovered in the UK as cases of the illness continue to rise.

In the UK, the majority of the cases have been  seen in London  - which holds 692 infections. Now, medics have revealed that patients attending sexual health clinics in the capital are experiencing symptoms that have not been seen in previous outbreaks. Most people who get the illness will usually have cold and flu like symptoms such as a fever and  headache  - before a rash appears. Experts looked at 54  monkeypox  patients who tested positive during a 12 day period in May this year. They found that patients in London were predominately presenting with skin lesions in the genital area - with tiredness and fever being lesser symptoms compared with previous outbreaks. All the patients in the study were symptomatic and  presented with some sort of skin lesions Analysis found that 94 per cent had at least one skin lesion on the genital or perianal skin - signs that have not previously been noted. Around 18 per cent did not report any symptoms before they recognised they had skin issues.

She added: ""It is possible that at various stages of the infection monkeypox may mimic common STIs, such as herpes and syphilis, in its presentation.  ""It’s important that sexual health clinicians and patients are aware of the symptoms of monkeypox as misdiagnosis of the infection may prevent the opportunity for appropriate intervention and prevention of onward transmission.  ""Additional resources are urgently required to support services in managing this condition.” Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: Writing in the  The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal , experts said the  high prevalence of genital skin lesions in patients means sexual health clinics are set to see more cases of monkeypox in the future. Dr Nicolo Girometti, from the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Currently, the UK and several other countries are seeing a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics, with no apparent links to countries where the disease is endemic. ""Monkeypox is a novel diagnosis within the sexual health setting and our study, the first to publish on cases from this UK outbreak, will support future case finding and clinical care.”  The report from the clinic in London comes days after medics in the US said doctors needed to be on the lookout for  less common signs of the illness. In the US there are currently with 460 cases with California being worst hit. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said some patients are experiencing these five symptoms: In a report from the CDC, medics explained that while rashes are common, they don't usually feature in the tissue in the lining of the mouth. Other patients have said rashes have caused them to experience pain in the anus and rectum and in some cases, rectal bleeding has occurred. Many have also had painful inflammation of the rectal lining - with others experiencing the sensation of having to poo when their bowels are actually empty. The World Health Organisation's Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""It’s now clear that there is an unusual situation, meaning even the virus is behaving unusually from how it used to behave in the past."" Details from the CDC report state that for some people who have the bug, rashes have been either 'scattered or localised' to a specific part of the body. However, medics also stated that common flu-like symptoms that often occur with cases of monkeypox 'have not always occurred before the rash if they have occurred at all.'",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19097271/new-monkeypox-symptoms-discovered-signs-not-ignore/,The Sun

Infections are also  rising in the US , where there are now 605 cases, with California being the worst hit with 117. One US man said that when he arrived unwell at a hospital in Washington, medics had no idea what to do, and were even  Googling  his condition. The biologist believes he caught the illness from a gathering of  OnlyFans  creators. As part of the event of a few dozen people, Alex said they had been filming sex scenes. He said he went to medics with 'the worst pain of my life', and believes three other cases may have come from the event,  NBC reported. It comes as the WHO revealed there is now 6,000 cases confirmed across 58 countries. Speaking at a press conference, the UN health agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said testing remains a challenge - with probable cases not being picked up. ""I continue to be concerned by the scale and spread of the virus. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence ""My teams are following the data. I plan to reconvene the emergency committee so they're updated on the current epidemiology and evolution of the monkeypox outbreak, and implementation of counter measures. ""I will bring them together in the week of July 18 or sooner if needed,"" he said. Brits have already been warned to heed caution when it comes to   summer events , In the UK, the majority of the cases have been  seen in London  - which holds 692 infections. Medics  recently revealed  that patients attending sexual health clinics in the capital are experiencing symptoms that have not been seen in previous outbreaks. Most people who get the illness will usually have cold and flu like symptoms such as a fever and  headache  - before a rash appears. Experts looked at 54  monkeypox  patients who tested positive during a 12 day period in May this year. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: They found that patients in London were predominately presenting with skin lesions in the genital area - with tiredness and fever being lesser symptoms compared with previous outbreaks. All the patients in the study were symptomatic and presented with some sort of skin lesions. Analysis found that 94 per cent had at least one skin lesion on the genital or perianal skin - signs that have not previously been noted. Around 18 per cent did not report any symptoms before they recognised they had skin issues. Dr Ruth Byrne, from the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, added that a quarter of patients also tested  positive for  gonorrhoea  or  chlamydia  at the same time as the monkeypox infection. She added: ""It is possible that at various stages of the infection monkeypox may mimic common STIs, such as herpes and syphilis, in its presentation. ""It’s important that sexual health clinicians and patients are aware of the symptoms of monkeypox as misdiagnosis of the infection may prevent the opportunity for appropriate intervention and prevention of onward transmission. ""Additional resources are urgently required to support services in managing this condition.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19120448/monkeypox-patients-complain-worst-pain-emergency-meeting/,The Sun
Monkeypox patients told to use condoms for months after infection amid fears virus ‘spreads via semen’,Vanessa Chalmers,"13:27, 18 Jul 2022","MONKEYPOX patients have been told they must use condoms for months after they’ve had the bug. It comes amid fears the virus can spread via semen, even when somebody is not showing signs of illness. The UK Health and Security Agency said on Friday there have now been 1,856 confirmed cases of  monkeypox  in the UK, as of July 15. The significant majority of these cases are in London, and almost always in  gay or bisexual men . UKHSA said there is a “body of evidence” showing  monkeypox  is present in the semen of people infected. In one man from Italy, viral particles were found in semen 11 days after the infection. Health officials said: “The evidence relating to the transmission of monkeypox through semen is limited at the present time. “In line with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance, UKHSA is now advising people to use condoms for 12 weeks after infection.  “This is a precaution to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to a partner.” It said people who were symptomatic were advised not to have sex at all.

UKHSA also said that some people who have recovered from monkeypox will need to get a PCR test on their semen. These people are those undergoing fertility treatment or who have an immunocomprised sexual partner. Vaccines are being given to people deemed the most at-risk of monkeypox - such as a person living with a patient. Gay and bisexual men are also being offered a vaccine in some cases if they attend sex parties or have multiple partners. UKHSA said overall, the number of monkeypox cases is small and the risk to the public remains low. The  virus is mild  and typically causes flu-like  symptoms , including a high temperature, headache and muscle aches, followed by a rash that starts on the face.  The rash  looks like chickenpox until blisters form.  Dr Hugh Adler, Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said it was reassuring that cases were not growing at an “exponential rate” in the UK. But he said: “Less reassuringly, the outbreak shows no signs of slowing down. “Overwhelmingly, men who have sex with men remain at highest risk currently.” Monkeypox has caused outbreaks in Africa for decades, but the recent explosion of cases outside of the continent has baffled experts. According to the WHO, the outbreak has reached 63 countries. “I am concerned by the increasing number of monkeypox cases in the  EU ,"" said EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides today. She added there were now over 7,000 cases reported in the EU, marking a nearly 50 per cent increase from last week. Nearly 1,500 cases have been identified in the  US  since the end of May, and similarly, these are almost all in gay and bisexual men. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says: “While many of those affected in the current global outbreaks are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has monkeypox can get the illness.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19236927/monkeypox-patients-condoms-fears-virus-spreads-via-semen/,The Sun
WHO poised to rename monkeypox hMPXV amid fears it could fuel racism,Terri-Ann Williams,"10:02, 15 Jun 2022","MONKEYPOX is set to be renamed amid fears it could fuel racism. The  World Health Organization  (WHO) is overseeing a review of the bug - which could see  the illness  called hMPXV. The illness was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research - hence the name monkeypox. The review from the WHO comes after 30 scientists  wrote a letter  calling for the change, over concerns it could provoke racism and stigmatisation. Anyone can get  monkeypox , and before the current outbreak, it was mostly found in African countries. But experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO said it was currently working with experts around the world on changing the name of the virus. In a letter to the organisation scientists said that ""continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising."" The note continued: ""The most obvious manifestation of this is the use of photos of African patients to depict the pox lesions in mainstream media in the global north."" Medics claim that the 'current narrative' is linking the  rise in cases  to Africa or West Africa, or Nigeria.

Dr Tedros also revealed that the WHO would be converging next week to discuss whether or not the outbreak will be given 'emergency status.' In recent weeks around 1,600 cases have been detected globally - something experts say is 'concerning'. In the US, the total number of infections that have been registered is 72, with California and New York having the majority of cases. ""For that reason I have decided to convene the Emergency Committee under the international health regulations next week, to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,"" Dr Tedros said. In the UK there have been 524 detected cases, after 152 were confirmed today. Anyone can get the illness, with Brits being urged to visit a sexual health clinic if you have new  blisters or rashes . Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: A  technical briefing  issued the UKHSA on Friday found that the majority of cases are in London - with 99 per cent of them being in men. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. UKHSA admitted that ""traditional contact tracing is currently challenging"". Where gender information was available, 311 of 314 confirmed cases were male, with three confirmed female cases. Monkeypox  is not considered a  sexually transmitted infection  (STI). However, the data suggests that this is the primary way that the virus is spreading. The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments.""

The 5 unusual monkeypox symptoms you must know as virus spreads,Terri-Ann Williams,"13:38, 30 Jun 2022","CASES of monkeypox are rising across the globe, but medics have warned there are 'unusual symptoms' people might be missing. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there are now more than 3,400  infections  that have been detected. Data from the UK states that there are currently  1,076 cases  across the country, a jump of 32 per cent on last week. The  NHS  says the main signs of the illness include a high temperature, head, muscle aches and back ache. Others may also experience swollen glands, shivering and exhaustion before  developing a rash . However, medics  in the US , where there are currently 351 cases of the bug, say doctors need to be on the look out for less typical signs of the illness. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said some patients are experiencing these five symptoms: In a report from the CDC, medics explained that while rashes are common, they don't usually feature in the tissue in the lining of the mouth. Other patients have said rashes have caused them to experience pain in the anus and rectum and in some cases, rectal bleeding has occurred.

Details from the CDC report state that for some people who have the bug, rashes have been either 'scattered or localised' to a specific part of the body. However, medics also stated that common flu-like symptoms that often occur with cases of monkeypox 'have not always occurred before the rash if they have occurred at all.' People who have contracted  monkeypox  will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Dr Tedros this week said that the WHO has become worried about the spread in cases globally. ""I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women,"" he told a briefing. Monkeypox  is spread through close physical contact, meaning it's easily transmissible. In the UK the majority of cases are in  London , and one health chief this week urged people to head caution when socialising. Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the outbreak in the UK is continuing to grow. ""We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. ""If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on. ""Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. ""However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk."" Dr Makki said that if you are concerned you might have  the illness , then you should not got to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. She added: ""Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. """,https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19048829/unusual-monkeypox-symptoms-know-virus-spreads/,The Sun
Warning monkeypox could spread to pregnant women and vulnerable as cases soar,Terri-Ann Williams,"15:23, 30 Jun 2022","AS monkeypox cases continue to soar globally, pregnant women have been warned to be wary of the signs and symptoms. Most people who get the bug will have a mild illness, but it can be particularly dangerous for the most vulnerable in society. So far, the majority of  cases  have been seen in men, but the infection is easily transmissible as it's passed through skin to skin contact. Experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) have this week warned that the continuous spread of the virus is worrying for certain groups of people. ""WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""I'm concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest the virus establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women."" Pregnant women  are more susceptible to illness, due to the fact that their immune system is compromised. When you're pregnant, certain parts of your immune system are enhanced as you grow a fetus, while others are dampened. But during this time, your immune system is in a state of flux - as it constantly tries to keep up with your ever changing body. It's because of this that pregnant women are in danger, as they become more vulnerable to viruses such as monkeypox and  Covid-19 . Infections of the bug have now hit more than 3,400 globally.

"Monkeypox ‘not a gay disease,’ blast experts – after infected men reveal they are suffering debilitating pain & lesions",,"0:06, 7 Jul 2022","EXPERTS have blasted the misconception that the monkeypox virus is ""a gay disease"" as it continues to spread throughout the US. The health officials are warning the public that sexual orientation does not affect your susceptibility to the virus.  While most cases of monkeypox in America and Europe involve gay and bisexual men, correlation, in this case, does not equal causation, experts say. ""This is not a gay disease,"" Fenway Institute medical research director Dr Ken Mayer told the  Boston Globe . The remarks come as the US has seen 605 confirmed monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases with 7,243 reported worldwide, according to CDC data. The virus appearing in queer males is a painful recall to the deadliest epidemic of the 1980s.  The spread of  human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) and autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) primarily through gay males in the 1980s made the disease that much deadlier due to stigmatization. Health officials are determined to not experience the same as monkeypox cases rise in the US and the UK. Mayer explained that the disease has largely stayed among men who have sex with men because that's where it began. If the virus first affected straight people, it would likely have remained among them, according to Mayer.

This contributes to it being particularly vulnerable to men who visit sexual establishments such as bathhouses and sex workers. Health officials also stress the spread can just as easily happen via contaminated objects.  The onset of monkeypox often includes intense fever and headaches. However, for some, the disease festers into painful, very visible skin lesions.  The  CDC's  announcement of 53 cases of monkeypox near Washington DC alone has led to the introduction of two new vaccine sites. The number of vaccines available is limited, and  spots for vaccinations  at the sites fill up as quickly as they are offered.  Priority for vaccinations is being given to those whom monkeypox poses the highest threat.  The eligibility criteria for DC vaccinations includes gay and bisexual males, transgender women, non-binary, male-bodied individuals who are sexually active with other men. The eligibility is also extended to sex workers of any sexual orientation and gender, as well as those who are staff at establishments where sexual activities are engaged in regularly.  If you are displaying monkeypox symptoms or believe you have come into contact with the monkeypox virus, contact a local healthcare provider immediately.

The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: The median age for those most affected is 36. Medics stated that the majority of cases are not in those who have documented travel to endemic countries - such as West Africa. In recent years, there have been just seven cases of monkeypox, between 2018 and 2021 in the UK. Of these, four were imported, with two cases having been household contacts and one had been a health care worker who had contact with an imported case. In the previous cases they had been no evidence of community transmission. The illness was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research - hence the name monkeypox. At present, England is deemed to be at a level two outbreak which means 'transmission within a defined sub-population with high number of close contacts'. However, the country is being monitored for signs of a level 3 outbreak, which means 'transmission within multiple sub-populations or larger sub-population'.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19027031/uk-monkeypox-cases-soar-health-officials-stay-at-home/,The Sun
Vital first steps to take after monkeypox infection & top sign you have the virus revealed by expert as US cases hit 700,Christopher Eberhart,"21:49, 8 Jul 2022","THE number of monkeypox cases continues to climb nationwide, and it's vital to catch symptoms early, isolate and talk to a doctor, according to an expert. Navin Khosla, a Medical Writer at  NiceRx , told The Sun in an exclusive interview this week that the most common symptoms include high temperature, muscle aches, swollen glands, fatigue and shivering. “If you believe you might have monkeypox, then it’s vital you isolate and ring your doctor and explain your symptoms,"" Khosla said. ""They will talk you through the next steps and what you need to do in order to prevent the virus from transmitting to other people.” Many people are already hyper-vigilant of irregularities felt in the bodies or symptoms possibly connected to the coronavirus, Khosla said.  The same attention has to be shifted to potential monkeypox symptoms to stop the spread following this week's announcement that there are  more than 700 cases in the US. Unlike Covid, the spread is slower and symptoms are milder. Most importantly, there have been no reported deaths connected to monkeypox yet, according to the well-respected medical writer.  ""Although cases of monkeypox in the US are on the rise, it’s a rare disease and most people who contract the virus usually only suffer from mild symptoms which last around two to four weeks,"" he said. There's some concern that this can be a Covid 2.0 and turn into another global pandemic, but Kholsa said that doesn't appear to be the direction the disease is moving in.  ""Unlike Covid-19, the symptoms of monkeypox are a lot less mild and the cases have been a lot lower globally, so we would predict that monkeypox would not have the same effects as the covid-19 pandemic,"" he said.

He listed the main symptoms as: a high fever, muscle aches, swollen glands, fatigue and shivering. It's typically spread through human transmission and animals.  For humans, ""it’s important to avoid contact with any humans who are unwell,"" Kholsa said.  ""Refrain from sharing bedding, towels and other items they may have been in contact with.  ""It can spread quickly through the body and a rash typically spreads within 24 hours and becomes most concentrated on the face, arms and legs.” Animals are another medium of transmission.  “No matter how obscure this may sound, it’s important to stay away from any dead animals you may come across, whether that’s in the street or local woodlands,"" Kholsa said.  ""Stay away from animals which appear unwell because monkeypox can be transmitted through animals.

Pregnant women are more susceptible to illness, due to the fact that their immune system is compromised. Meanwhile, infections of the bug have now hit more than 3,400 globally. In the US alone, infections have been climbing with 351 being recorded by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19054325/american-monkeypox-diagnosis-painful-symptoms-cdc/,The Sun
"UK Monkeypox cases hit 2,000 as government stockpiles vaccines to combat outbreak",Vanessa Chalmers,"18:11, 19 Jul 2022","MONKEYPOX cases have now tipped 2,000, with a 15 per cent increase over three days. The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) have secured another 100,000 vaccine doses to try and control the outbreak. Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: “ Monkeypox  is a rare and usually mild disease that does not spread easily between people. ""But we are taking action to help further manage the outbreak in the UK by procuring over 100,000 additional doses of vaccine. “The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine, and I would urge people to take up the offer as soon as they are contacted. “In the meantime, please contact a sexual health clinic if you notice any  unusual rashes  or lesions.” The  virus is mild  and typically causes flu-like  symptoms , including a high temperature, headache and muscle aches, followed by a rash that starts on the face. The rash  looks like chickenpox until blisters form. The virus has now been confirmed in 2,137 people as of July 18, after the bizarre outbreak started at the end of May. Most cases are in England (2,050), particularly London (1,492). Monkeypox  has caused outbreaks in Africa for decades, but the recent explosion of cases outside of the continent has baffled experts.

Gay and bisexual men are also being offered a vaccine in some cases if they attend sex parties or have multiple partners. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: “Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.” Dr Merav Kliner, Deputy Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow. “Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms. “While our advice on isolation is changing, monkeypox is still a serious public health challenge, and we urge contacts to take a break from any activities or events involving skin to skin contact.” Sex, hugging and kissing can all spread monkeypox from one person to another. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.  But it can be caught from touching the scabs of someone with the bug, touching their bed sheets or breathing in their respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing or kissing. It comes after the UKHSA warned that monkeypox patients  should use condoms  for 12 weeks after they’ve had the bug. The agency said there is a “body of evidence” showing monkeypox is present in the semen of people infected.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19253079/uk-monkeypox-cases-2000-government-stockpiles-vaccines/,The Sun
Majority of monkeypox cases are in men in London – as main age group is revealed,Terri-Ann Williams,"17:13, 10 Jun 2022","AROUND 99 per cent of monkeypox cases are in men, new data has found. A further 43 cases were detected today, bringing the  UK's total to 366 . A report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed that 81 per cent of those infected are  living in London . The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old. UKHSA admitted that ""traditional contact tracing is currently challenging"". Where gender information was available, 311 of 314 confirmed cases were male, with three confirmed female cases. The health officials did interviews and found that 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same sex contact. Monkeypox  is not considered a  sexually transmitted infection  (STI). However, the data suggests that this is the primary way that the virus is spreading. Health experts noted ""casual sex"", often with new partners, was making contact tracing difficult.

""We always encourage use of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Monkeypox is not an STI by nature, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. ""The spots, ulcers and blisters, which are most likely to pass on monkeypox, can appear on any part of the body, so condoms will not necessarily prevent transmission of the virus between two people who are in direct contact, including during sex. ""Although it is not clear if monkey pox can be transmitted through genital secretions, UKHSA is advising the precaution of using condoms for 8 weeks after a confirmed diagnosis of monkeypox. ""Monkeypox can also be passed on through contact with clothing, bedding and towels used by someone with monkeypox."" The report also stated that recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within  Europe . Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: Earlier this week, the UKHSA urged  Brits to stay away from loved one s if they get monkeypox under new rules. The report said that for the first time, the UKHSA has graded the outbreak on a levelling system. ""At present, England is judged to be in Level 2 and we are monitoring closely for any evidence of Level 3,"" it said. Level 2 is when there is ""transmission within a defined sub-population"", while Level 3 escalates to multiple or a larger population. Level 4 represents significant spread of the bug. The current outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said: “We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments.  ""We use the new data rapidly to inform the public health response and we continue to work to reduce transmission.  ""We are grateful to all those who have come forward for testing and the patients who continue to help us understand the outbreak through participating in studies and investigations.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Monkeypox cases in New York City jump by 60% in only FOUR DAYS after infections nationwide climb to 244,Danielle Cinone,"17:00, 28 Jun 2022","MONKEYPOX cases in New York City increased by 60 percent in just four days this weekend after infections nationwide climbed to 244. The city of New York's  official website  revealed on Monday that 48 people across NYC tested positive for orthopoxvirus, all cases which are likely monkeypox, as of June 27, 2022. ""Most of these people have had mild illness, have not been hospitalized and have recovered on their own,"" the website explains.  ""Even with mild illness, the rash and sores from monkeypox can be itchy and painful."" The website adds: ""Anyone can get and spread monkeypox. The current cases are primarily spreading among social networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, so this community is currently at greater risk of exposure."" The spike in suspected monkeypox cases marks a 60 percent rise in just four days,  NBC New York  reports. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), as of 4pm ET Monday, the total confirmed number of  monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases  across the US reached 244. On Monday, California appeared to have the most cases in the country with 62 cases, with New York ranking second with 37, before the numbers increased. Other states with high numbers of cases are Florida, Illinois, District of Columbia, and Massachusetts, a  CDC map  reveals. Although cases are going up in New York City, vaccination slots are filled and the ""Health Department has not yet received additional doses and will not be able to offer more appointments yet,"" NYC.gov states.

""This is yet another example of a public health failure. And consider what we just went through with COVID-19, we should be much more prepared,"" NYC Council Member Erik Bottcher said in regards to the unavailable vaccines, according to NBC New York. The US confirmed its first case of  monkeypox  in a traveler who returned to  Massachusetts  from  Canada  on May 17. The CDC has released  new guidance  about how to identify monkeypox during the outbreak. Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The  symptoms are followed by a rash  that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet. However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. And instead of widespread rashes, some patients saw scattered or localized lesions in areas other than the face, hands, or feet. At times, flu-like symptoms developed after the rash, but other people didn't have those symptoms at all. Scientists have warned of unusual symptoms in US patients that were not previously associated with the virus. Some patients reported pain in or around the anus and rectum, rectal bleeding, proctitis (painful inflammation of the rectum lining), or the feeling of needing a bowel movement even though the bowels are empty. Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses like smallpox and most people recover within weeks, but the disease is fatal for up to 1 in 10 people, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, monkeypox cases have risen again in the UK with officials urging Brits to stay at home if they think they have the illness. There are now 1,076 infections across the country, an increase of 32 percent on figures reported on Friday. Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the outbreak in the UK is continuing to grow. ""We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. ""If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/19028671/monkeypox-cases-new-york-infections-nationwide/,The Sun

Families should stay away from their loved ones if they get monkeypox – under new social distancing rules,Terri-Ann Williams,"16:14, 9 Jun 2022","FAMILIES have been urged to stay away from their loved ones if they have monkeypox, new guidance states. As cases of  the bug  continue to rise - Brits now have to stay one metre apart from those who are infected. The  most recent data  from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) states that there are 321 cases of the bug in the UK after a further 18 cases were detected yesterday. Where possible, experts have urged people to sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms. If this isn't possible, cases should avoid physical contact and keep at least three steps or one metre away from all household members. It is particularly important, they said, that infected persons stay away from any  pregnant  members of the household, young children and those who are immunosuppressed. This is because anyone in the above groups could be at risk of serious illness. Other guidance states that you should keep laundry separate from other households and avoid close contacts with pets. Anyone can get monkeypox - particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms.

People who are gay or bisexual and men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected. You should also get checked if you have been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks.

It means that  monkeypox  will be designated a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Other illnesses that also fall under this legislation include  Covid-19 , the  Plague , acute  meningitis ,  measles  and  smallpox .

Monkeypox cases hit 524 as 52 new infections detected amid fears of ‘global emergency’,Terri-Ann Williams,"12:43, 15 Jun 2022","A FURTHER 52 cases of monkeypox have been detected in the UK, raising the total to 524 infections. The increase in cases comes as the  World Health Organization  (WHO) is set to meet to discuss whether the  outbreak is an emergency .

In the US, the total number of infections that have been registered is 72, with California and New York having the majority of cases.

Anyone can get  monkeypox , and before the current outbreak, it was mostly found in African countries. But experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. In a letter to the organisation scientists said that ""continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising."" The note continued: ""The most obvious manifestation of this is the use of photos of African patients to depict the pox lesions in mainstream media in the global north."" A  technical briefing  issued the UKHSA on Friday found that the majority of cases in the UK are in London - with 99 per cent of them being in men.

The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: UKHSA admitted that ""traditional contact tracing is currently challenging"". Monkeypox  is not considered a  sexually transmitted infection  (STI). However, the data suggests that this is the primary way that the virus is spreading. Experts today told the WHO that Pride events could help in spreading public information about monkeypox. Steve Taylor, board member at EuroPride, said the virus – which has been mainly concentrated in the men who have sex with men community – must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ events. There are set to be around 750 pride events this summer across Europe and organisers say there will be clear messaging as to how people can protect themselves. Senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, Dr Catherine Smallwood was quizzed on why the majority of cases have been detected in men who have sex with men. She explained that 'all outbreaks start somewhere'. ""This virus doesn’t choose any one person against another, it’s opportunistic in its spread. “And how it will spread will really be defined by the opportunities it has. “It’s also a disease that has an incubation period of 21 days. We’re just over a month into this outbreak, understanding that outbreak, so it’s too early to conclude as to how it will be spreading amongst the general population,"" she added.

"I’m a monkeypox expert – from how it’s spread to protecting your family, here are the 13 things you need to know",Vanessa Chalmers,"21:00, 29 May 2022","FIRST came Covid, then a mysterious outbreak of hepatitis among kids and now monkeypox. It’s the latest health scare to send shivers down our spines, with words like “isolation” rearing their ugly heads once more. Monkeypox  is a rare viral disease typically seen in parts of central and west Africa, having been discovered in a colony of monkeys in 1958, and later in humans in 1970. On May 7, the UK Health Security Agency announced that a case had been detected in a patient who had  travelled to Britain from Nigeria . Since then cases have risen, with community spread and more than 300 cases outside Africa, according to the  World Health Organisation . More than 100 of those cases have been detected in the UK, with  one child ending up in intensive care  and infections confirmed across Europe and the US among other countries. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and  NHS  services. “If anyone suspects they have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111, or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though phone ahead before attending in person.” So, what is monkeypox, who is at risk and why are young men making up most of the cases so far? We asked Dr Amr Bayoumy, a virologist at Coventry University, to share everything you need to know. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence WHAT IS MONKEYPOX? LIKE coronavirus, monkeypox is what’s known as a zoonotic virus — meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. “Clinical symptoms are similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients,” Dr Amr says. “But while monkeypox is genetically similar to smallpox, it’s less severe.” Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, which just means that it’s consistently present, and accounts for some 9,000 cases a year. There are two strains, one originating from West Africa and most likely to be the one causing the global outbreak, and another from the Congo, which is more deadly. WHY IS IT CALLED MONKEYPOX? THE name suggests it originated from monkeys, but scientists can’t be certain. What they do know is where it was first identified. Dr Amr says: “Monkeypox was first isolated from lab monkeys in 1958, hence the name. However, the natural host is thought to be rodents such as rats, mice and squirrels, not monkeys.” In the 1970s, not long after the virus was discovered, it was first found in humans. HOW WILL I KNOW IF I’M AFFECTED? THE good news is that in most cases monkeypox is a mild disease and clears up on its own. Symptoms start between five and 21 days after a person is infected and can be mistaken for flu. Dr Amr tells Fab Daily: “Clinical symptoms include fever, headache, lymph node swelling and muscle aches. “Skin rashes usually start within one to three days after a fever. Symptoms can last two to four weeks, and in most cases a person will typically recover. “However, severe cases can be seen in children and people with compromised immune systems.” CAN PEOPLE DIE? IT’s been referred to as a “cousin” of smallpox, which is enough to instil fear because smallpox killed millions before it was eradicated in the 1980s, thanks to vaccines. However, monkeypox is less severe and less deadly. Dr Amr says: “The case fatality is three to six per cent, with fatalities higher in young children.” That’s for the Congo strain, the West African strain’s fatality rate is thought to be about one per cent. HOW WORRIED SHOULD I BE? MONKEYPOX is “not another Covid”, Dr Amr says, reassuringly. Unlike Covid, this virus doesn’t spread or mutate as quickly. And Dr Amr says transmission among humans is “not efficient”, with most people passing it on to less than one other person, meaning its R rate is less than one. “Transmission requires prolonged direct contact with an infected individual or his or her recently contaminated objects,” Dr Amr says. “Coronavirus is transmitted by breathing in contaminated droplets.” HOW DOES IT SPREAD? IN most cases a person is infected after coming into contact with an infected animal, but it can also be transmitted through close contact  with a person which appears to be the main source in this outbreak. Dr Amr explains this can happen if you touch the skin lesions of an infected person, or objects they have contaminated “such as bedding, towels or clothes”. IS IT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED? MONKEYPOX is not thought to be sexually transmitted in the traditional sense. But, it can be passed through sexual contact. You are contagious with the disease until scabs that form over a rash fall off. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said more research is needed to “better understand” if it could spread through sex via semen and vaginal fluid. WHO IS AT HIGHEST RISK? ANYONE who comes into close contact with an infected person is most risk. If you’ve recently travelled to West or Central Africa, you’re deemed higher risk too. But in general, Dr Amr says younger people are more likely to catch it. “People younger than 40 to 50 years old (depending on the country they live) may be more susceptible due to the end of smallpox vaccination campaigns globally in the 1980s,” he says. UK health chiefs have warned that so far a disproportionate number of cases have been detected in gay and bisexual men. That does not mean it’s a “gay disease”, TV doctor Ranj Singh told Attitude Magazine. Dr Ranj said men who have sex with men (MSM) are not at fault, but it might be that the first cases were detected in MSM networks. “This community should be on increased alert,” he added. The WHO added that cases in gay and bisexual men might be “because of positive health-seeking behaviour in this demographic”, as lots of cases have been detected at sexual health clinics. The WHO added: “Anyone who has close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox is at risk, regardless of who they choose to have sex with or any other factor. “Stigmatising people because of an illness is unacceptable.” ARE MY KIDS AT RISK? ONE child in the UK has ended up in intensive care with monkeypox. Official guidance states there are four groups at risk of severe disease: newborns, children, people who are immunocompromised and health workers. Seek help if you’re worried about your child. HOW CAN I PROTECT MY FAMILY? IF you know someone with monkeypox, avoid close contact. The Government says anyone with direct or household contact with a confirmed case should isolate for 21 days. Dr Amr says: “Avoid sharing bedding, towels or clothes. Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Avoid contact with pet rodents which may have monkeypox. “In 2003, the first outbreak outside Africa was linked to pet prairie dogs, a type of squirrel.” WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK I HAVE IT? DR Amr says: “Contact the NHS or your GP. Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people until you have been told what to do.” IS THERE A VACCINE? THE short answer is yes. Studies have shown the smallpox vaccine is around 85 per cent effective against monkeypox. “The smallpox vaccine is no longer available for the general public,” Dr Amr says. “But prior smallpox vaccination may result in milder illness.” The Government has stockpiled doses and close contacts of confirmed patients are being jabbed in a strategy known as “ring vaccination”. Dr Amr says: “Everyone who has been exposed to a patient receives the vaccine. “Ring vaccination requires complete and rapid surveillance and epidemiologic case investigation.” This strategy has worked for previous outbreaks of monkeypox. CAN IT BE TREATED? AN antiviral medicine known as tecovirimat has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms and infectiousness. It was licensed for monkeypox in Europe in 2022, but Dr Amr says it is not yet widely available. Most people recover by themselves without serious complications. Dr Amr adds: “The authorities are not powerless against monkeypox. We already have the tools — vaccines and medicines — to control infections.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18718452/monkeypox-expert-need-know/,The Sun
How to tell the difference between chickenpox and monkeypox,Terri-Ann Williams,"12:33, 30 May 2022","CASES of monkeypox are on the up in the UK, with 106 infections having been identified in the country. The illness can cause a rash on the body alongside symptoms such as fever and  headaches . It's these signs that are similar to a common illness that children often get -  chickenpox . Just last month parents were warned of a  dangerous outbreak  of chickenpox and  scarlet fever infections . Experts say that many common infections declined during  lockdown  but they're now circulating at higher levels, particularly affecting pre-school and nurseries. But what are the main differences between  monkeypox  and chicken pox, and what should you be on the look out for? Monkeypox Monkeypox is a rare disease that causes outbreaks in Africa. But unusually, it has started spreading across a number of untouched countries in Europe and the Americas. While  monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. About six per cent of cases are fatal, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Symptoms  usually last between five and 21 days after exposure. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence They start off similar to flu. But then  a rash  breaks out, starting on the face. Initial symptoms include: fever headache backache exhaustion An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. What starts as a seemingly harmless red rash - which looks like chickenpox - evolves into angry blisters that can last several days. The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. If it spreads to the eyes it can cause blindness. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. Medics have urged people who think they have monkeypox to  visit a sexual health clinic  rather than call 111. Head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Mateo Prochazka wants 111 staff to be able to focus on handling other health queries.  Chickenpox The main difference between the two is that chickenpox will not usually cause a headache and swollen lymph nodes. Chickenpox is another highly infectious infection caused by the varicella zoster virus, and presents itself with a characteristic rash, with vesicles on the face, spreading down over the body to the arms and legs. Although generally mild in otherwise healthy children, it can be more severe in  pregnant women  and immuno-suppressed individuals. Children with chickenpox should remain at home until they are better and the rash has gone. It's a very itchy condition and can make little ones feel miserable, even if they don't have very many spots. Before a rash appears, you might get a high temperature, aches and pains with a general feeling of illness and a loss of appetite. Adults who get chickenpox will usually have symptoms for longer and in most cases will have more spots. The  NHS  says that it is possible to get chickenpox more than once but that this is unusual. If you are worried about any of your signs and symptoms you should call 111 for advice. In an emergency, always dial 999. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Now the  World Health Organization  (WHO), has said the risk of the bug becoming non-endemic in some countries is starting to materialise. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the rise in cases was clearly concerning. Speaking at a press conference he said: ""The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic countries is real. ""More than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox have now been reported to WHO from 29 countries that are not endemic for the disease. ""So far, no deaths have been reported in these countries.

British Airway crew member struck down with monkeypox – sparking massive delay to London-bound flight,Stephen Moyes,"19:22, 21 Jun 2022","A DIPLOMATIC incident was brewing today after a British Airways crew member was struck down by monkeypox in Singapore. Government officials were in talks with authorities in Asia after they demanded the steward’s entire crew quarantine alongside their infected colleague for 21 days. BA  and the Home Office were trying to get permission to charter a plane to bring the rest of the staff home for further testing. Flight BA16 back to London was delayed for six hours today while the legal wrangle unfolded. The infected crew member had worked on the flight out from  Heathrow  to  Singapore , before completing the leg from  Asia  to  Sydney . He enjoyed downtime in Oz with the rest of his airline pals. But after the return flight from  Australia  to Singapore, the steward tested positive for monkeypox. It meant he was immediately quarantined and banned from working on the final return flight to  London . But a row broke out when Singapore authorities insisted a further nine crew and two technical BA staff also remain there in quarantine. A source said last night: “BA is desperate to bring its workforce home and have them in quarantine in Britain if needs be.

""It is an awkward situation and the government is now trying to prevent this becoming a diplomatic incident.” Last night oblivious passengers due to board BA16 from Singapore to Heathrow had no idea of the monkeypox drama. Passenger Tan Lay-Kok hit out online: “Got an unpleasant surprise when I checked my upcoming booking on BA16 from SIN to LHR to find it will be delayed by 6 hours.” A second unaffected BA crew in Singapore was due to work on the delayed flight back to the UK while the row continued behind the scenes. As of June 20, there are 793 confirmed infections in the UK. Of these cases, 766 are in England, 18 are in Scotland, three are in Northern Ireland and six are in Wales. In recent weeks around 2,103 cases have been detected globally, the most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) states. Anyone can get the illness - more so if you have been in contact or had sexual contact with a person who has symptoms. Health Promotion Specialist at Terrence Higgins Trust, Alex Sparrow, said a new targeted vaccination programme is a positive move. Data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK.

UK monkeypox infections hit 321 as further 18 cases detected,Terri-Ann Williams,"12:49, 8 Jun 2022","A FURTHER 18 monkeypox cases have been identified in the UK, bringing the total to 321. The status of the virus has now been  upgraded , as doctors have been urged to report infections to local councils. Medics as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said anyone can get monkeypox - particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. People who are gay or bisexual and men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected. There are currently 305 confirmed cases in England, 11 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 3 in Wales. Doctors have urged people to visit a sexual health clinic if you have a rash or blisters. You should also get checked if you have been in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they’ve not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks. The same applies if you have been to West or Central African in the past three weeks. The update on infections today comes after doctors will now have to inform local councils and health protection agencies if cases are detected. It means that  monkeypox  will be designated a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010.

Labs must also inform the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) if a case is detected in samples. If monkeypox is suspected, medics must tell the correct authorities within three days or within 24 hours for urgent cases. Wendi Shepherd, Monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of Monkeypox. ""This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. “It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.” Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: Last night  one Brit , who had been struck down with the infection, told how the 'farcial' health authorities only tried to trace him after he appeared on television. James McFadzean, 35, was left feeling ""rough"" after contracting  the virus  on May 25 following a trip to Dubai. But he told  TalkTV's  Tom Newton-Dunn how the UKHSA never responded to his phone calls - despite testing positive two weeks ago before cases  exploded to over 300 in the UK .

I was one of the first Brits to catch monkeypox and was isolated for weeks,Terri-Ann Williams,"13:23, 7 Jun 2022","MONKEYPOX cases are rising in the UK with 302 now having been registered.  While the infection spread is still on a relatively small scale, one man has now revealed he was one of the first to catch the illness. Yesterday it was reported that a  further 73 cases  were detected - all of which are in the last month alone. Most cases of  monkeypox  are in England (287), followed by Scotland (10), Wales (three) and Northern Ireland (two). Medics have also said that the majority of the cases have been detected in London and in gay men. Speaking for the first time, George (not his real name) has revealed that he was one of the first to contract the bug in the capital. The healthcare worker said he initially had been  suffering with a fever , lower back pain, and also had swollen lymph nodes. George, who identifies as gay, said he also had a rash and a black lesion on his groin, alongside little spot-like sores that had sprouted across his body. Speaking to  The Telegraph , he said he had no idea what it was and at first, thought it was a  sexually transmitted infection . He first went to a sexual heath clinic in the capital, where he said experts ran tests but nothing came back.

""Suddenly everyone was in PPE and taking it incredibly seriously. ""I feel like I managed to dodge Covid, but then suddenly I had monkeypox – at this point there were, like, less than 10 people confirmed in the UK. And then I’m one of them. ""I just had this sense of disbelief. The whole thing felt very surreal.” After a PCR test confirmed suspicions, he was sent to the Royal Free Hospital's infectious diseases ward. Last week it was revealed that medics are focusing on dating apps and gays bars when it comes to the spread of the illness. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said: ""Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men, so it’s particularly important to be aware of the symptoms if you’re in these groups.” A report said: “Investigations to date have identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad."" George explained that he believes he caught the infection from a sauna in Madrid in March. He said it was the 'most famous' gay sauna in the city, and said while he didn't have unprotected sex - he was intimate with others. After his diagnosis he told his flatmates, who then had gloves and masks on and also asked him to wear the same protective gear. Luckily, he was offered a room at the Royal London and spent nine nights isolating there before being moved to Liverpool for five nights to make more space for people in the capital. George said he got the all clear three weeks after a positive test. While he is now fully recovered and was able to celebrate the  Platinum Jubilee , he said he has suffered stigma because of the infection. He added that there have already been some homophobic remarks. with some people assuming he got monkeypox from having unprotected sex. Because of this, he said he's worried about public perception. Experts say that if you think you have monkeypox, then you should visit a sexual health clinic. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

"Monkeypox UK symptoms LIVE:  Virus outbreak could be ‘tip of the iceberg’, WHO warns as 257 confirmed cases worldwide",Milica Cosic,": 12:52, 30 May 2022","THE WORLD Health Organization has warned that the monkeypox cases found in recent weeks could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are  many more cases that are undetected  in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said on Friday. Since the UK first reported a confirmed  monkeypox  case on 7 May, over 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency. The World Health Organization has received reports of 257 confirmed monkeypox cases and about 120 suspected cases in 23 nations where the virus is not endemic as of Thursday, it said in a Sunday update. Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday, while Argentina confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in Latin America on Friday. “We are still at the  very, very beginning of this event ,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva.  “We know that  we will have more cases in the coming days ,” she said, but stressed there was no need to panic. “This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” More than 100 of those cases have been detected in the UK, with  one child ending up in intensive care  and infections confirmed across Europe and the US among other countries. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly detect new monkeypox cases through our extensive surveillance network and  NHS  services. “If anyone suspects they have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111, or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though phone ahead before attending in person.” So, what is monkeypox, who is at risk and why are young men making up most of the cases so far? We asked Dr Amr Bayoumy, a virologist at Coventry University, to share everything you need to know. Read the article in full  here . THE WORLD Health Organization has warned that the monkeypox cases found in recent weeks could be just the beginning. “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are  many more cases that are undetected  in communities,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said on Friday.

It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.” The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population “remains low”. Gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men are being urged in particular to be aware of symptoms, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness. The rare virus has also spread across 20 countries in Europe, with  Brits already warned to be “alert” when they hit holiday hotspots  this year.  The full list of European countries with confirmed monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have reported cases And elsewhere in the world: A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual. Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox. It is possible to become infected by touching the clothes or bed sheets which have been used by someone with Monkeypox. This means that the danger of contracting the disease is low, with around 20 cases confirmed in the UK currently. If you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. Monkeypox  comes from the same family of viruses as  smallpox  but is much less severe. No deaths have been reported  from the 2022 outbreak of the disease in the UK. The chance of catching monkeypox in the UK is very low as  cases are rare. Cases have been linked to some  festivals in Europe . According to the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) up to a tenth of people who contract the virus may die but this is mainly in younger age groups. The majority of those who catch monkeypox will survive. So, if you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. Read more  here . A rash  which looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters, and then scabbing, is the main  symptom of monkeypox .  It appears a couple of days after flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache and chills.  Professor David Heymann, the former head of WHO’s emergencies department, said it’s known that monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, “and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission”. But he said there was unlikely to be widespread transmission of the virus, and the outbreak might be traceable to a single infection. While the monkeypox is concerning experts, they have reassured it is “not another Covid”. Professor David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO’s emergencies department, said it does not spread in the air – although can be passed from sneezing and coughing – and we have vaccines to protect against it. The UK is  stockpiling  jabs against the virus which will only be given to those who are deemed at high risk after being in contact with a case. The vaccine was designed to fight smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, before being discontinued. But it is also 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, given they are similar viruses of the same family – although the former is more mild. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said Monday there were no plans for an “at scale” vaccination programme in the UK. It comes after  a British tourist  staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is tested for monkeypox. The holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura is one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed, health chiefs in the region said. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia said the number of beds available depends on how many cases would need that level of care. He said: “The concern is that in the 2018 outbreak, the case infected a health worker and that was thought to be while they were changing the bedding because the flakes from their scabs were spread.  “Patients have to be kept in the specialist unit to avoid the spread.” An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS has tried and tested plans in place for treating sporadic cases of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, through a network of highly specialised centres providing expert care. “The NHS is working closely with UKHSA to ensure the small number of people identified are treated in line with their guidance.” THE NHS only has enough space to treat 50 monkeypox patients, as cases continue to rise in the UK. Guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) states that all confirmed cases need to be transferred to high consequence infectious disease (HCID) units if they need hospital care. But just 15 beds are believed to have existed before Covid- with the spread of the virus ramping up capacity. Now sources say there are only 50 beds and many people will have to quarantine at home, the  MailOnline  reported. Experts said there is ‘always a risk beds will run out’, especially if the situation ‘deteriorates further’. It’s unclear whether the HCID units were kept following the pandemic, with many centres having being closed. Around 57 Brits have the illness, with more cases having been announced yesterday. Number 10 is ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation – but travel restrictions have been ruled out. The World Health Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief said: “We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities.” Monkeypox is related to smallpox, a deadly disease that was eradicated in 1980. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday published recommendations by its group of independent experts on a smallpox vaccine that limit its use to only people who work closely with viruses such as monkeypox. The Jynneos vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, will be available for the recommended groups at a time when monkeypox infections are spreading in Europe, United States and beyond. The publication of the vote by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which took place in November last year, formalizes the recommendations. A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is expecting more cases of monkeypox in the coming days as public health officials intensify their efforts to contain a virus that originates in the jungles of west and central Africa. The HSE is attempting to trace people who may have been exposed to the virus by a man from the east of the country who tested positive on Friday after presenting with symptoms. The results of tests on a suspected second case are awaited. The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland recorded its first case on Thursday and is expecting more in the weeks ahead. In a statement yesterday the HSE said people infected with monkeypox usually recover within weeks, though it warned that severe illness might occur in those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and babies. There is no known cure. Kim Roberts, an assistant professor of virology at Trinity College Dublin, said more cases are almost certain as it can take up to seven days, and sometimes weeks, for symptoms to develop after exposure. ""This means it can take longer to identify cases at this stage, but also that public-health teams have time to identify first contacts and break the rate of transmission. I would expect the numbers across the different countries which have expe- rienced outbreaks to go up in the coming weeks and months, but then fall as public-health teams break the transmission cycle,"" she said. Covid-19 hospital cases have fallen to their lowest rate since last summer, an expert has said. Professor Linda Bauld said on Friday that daily hospital cases with the virus had dropped to less than 50, the first time the figure has dropped so low in almost a year. She also added there were ""about 650"" people in hospital with the virus, compared to more than 2,000 last month. ""We've seen a significant decline in levels of infection in the community,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland on Friday. ""The (Office for National Statistics) infection survey will have some results out today that shows another drop."" She added: ""That R number - which nobody is hearing about any more, but is still with us - is well below ... it's between 0.7 and 0.9."" However, Prof Bauld stressed that the virus had not gone away and the potential for new variants continues. The Omicron variant, which spread aggressively during the winter, caused a surge in cases. ""We're not saying that everything's over because we may see new variants, and we may see surges in infection again, but we do seem to be in a much more stable situation,"" she said. An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. What starts as a seemingly harmless red rash – which looks like chickenpox – evolves into angry blisters that can last several days. The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. If the rash spreads to the eyes it can cause blindness. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. Symptoms generally last from 14 to 21 days, with severe cases relating to age, the extent of virus exposure, the patient’s health and the severity of complications. Doctors and the public have been warned to keep an eye out for unexplained rashes. Monkeypox causes symptoms  between five and 21 days after exposure. The symptoms of monkeypox start off similar to flu. But then  a rash  breaks out, starting on the face. Initial symptoms include: fever headache backache exhaustion SEVERE monkeypox patients may be infectious for up to ten weeks, scientists fear. An investigation of previous patients who had  the disease  found one man tested positive more than 70 days after he first showed symptoms. It comes as cases of the virus  reach 71 in the UK , and health officials have urged people to stay alert to symptoms. Signs of the disease  in the early stages include fever, headache, chills, back and muscle aches. Patients are contagious until their scabs fall off, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) says, and the scabs themselves can contain viral material. However, the latest study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggests people may be infectious long after their rash has settled. Study author Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved.  “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.” Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual. Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox. It is possible to become infected by touching the clothes or bed sheets which have been used by someone with Monkeypox. This means that the danger of contracting the disease is low, with around 20 cases confirmed in the UK currently. If you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. Read the article in full  here . Mexico on Saturday reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the country, according to deputy health secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell. The patient was a 50-year-old permanent resident of New York who is being treated in Mexico City, Lopez-Gatell said on Twitter. ""He was probably infected in the Netherlands,"" Lopez-Gatell wrote, adding that the patient was being isolated and was in stable condition. The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus. If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: Dr Carlos Maluquer de Motes, Reader in Molecular Virology, University of Surrey, said: “Isolation is one of the most effective measures to contain the spread of a disease, particularly a viral disease, because it limits the number of susceptible individuals that can be exposed to the virus. “Isolation of confirmed cases and the identification and vaccination of all their close contacts creates a circle of protected people around a positive case that is very effective in breaking chains of transmission. “This ‘ring vaccination’ strategy was successfully used to eradicate smallpox, so it is a proven strategy to contain poxvirus disease.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18691376/monkeypox-virus-uk-symptoms-live-cases-death-rate/,The Sun
Traces of monkeypox found in patient’s semen prompts WHO investigation,Sarah Grealish,"17:40, 15 Jun 2022","THE World Health Organisation is looking into reports that the monkeypox virus is present in the semen of patients. It comes as today  a further 52 cases of monkeypox were detected  in the UK, raising the total to 524 infections. In recent weeks around 1,600 cases have been detected globally - something experts say is 'concerning'. And now the WHO is exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted. Many cases in the current monkeypox outbreak are among sexual partners who have had close contact. The agency reiterated that virus is mainly transmitted via close interpersonal contact. In recent days, scientists say they have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany. Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said it was not known whether recent reports meant the monkeypox virus could be sexually transmitted. She said: ""This may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence ""We really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin-to-skin contact."" Medics say you should contact a sexual health clinic if you have rashes or blisters and if you have been in contact with someone who has had monkeypox in the last three weeks. This guidance also applies to those who have been to West or Central Africa in the past three weeks. However,  the WHO are also set to rename the virus  - in a move which could see the illness called hMPXV. It comes after 30 scientists wrote a letter calling for the change, over concerns it could provoke racism and stigmatisation. Anyone can get monkeypox, and before the current outbreak, it was mostly found in African countries. But experts are worried that references to the illness as African are problematic. In a letter to the organisation scientists said that ""continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatising."" The note continued: ""The most obvious manifestation of this is the use of photos of African patients to depict the pox lesions in mainstream media in the global north.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18899513/traces-of-monkeypox-semen-who-investigation/,The Sun
I had monkeypox and our farcical health authorities only tried to trace me AFTER I went on TV,Tom Hussey,"21:01, 7 Jun 2022","A BRIT struck down with deadly Monkeypox has told how ""farcical"" UK experts responsible for tracing the disease never bothered to get in contact with him - until he went on TV.

James, from London, is the  first Brit to go public with the disease  which leaves sufferers with fluid-filled blisters that appear like chicken pox, but James didn't get these. But he fumed that he can ""only wonder"" how long contact tracers will take to get in contact with the now hundreds of cases in the UK if they had ""trouble"" containing it when there were small numbers. The rare infection - mainly found in parts of west or central Africa - has now struck down 302 Brits who have been asked to isolate. The first case in the UK was recorded on April 29.

""You would think, ok the virus is different, surely the infrastructure is there... how many people does it take to call that many people! Own the mistake, say we're getting on it and do better"", he added. There have been no reported deaths in the UK from the disease which sees suffers develop flu-like symptoms within one to five days of contracting it. James said he didn't think he had the disease at first, but then his symptoms kicked in. He explained: ""It was very rough for the first week but now I feel fit and well and back to normal health. The first symptoms of monkeypox include (NHS advice): ""Everything you hear, everything you read talks about this telltale rash, or lumps or pimples which I never had at any point of the illness. ""I felt ill much like a flu: fever, very exhausted, back pain"". James explained he consulted a local clinic who said he should go for a Monkeypox test which turned out positive. But he never developed the trademark ""pox"" which he explained made it hard to understand when he was going to get over the disease and it left doctors confused, he claimed. Dr Yimmy Chow, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, UKHSA said: “We’ve made multiple attempts to reach this individual by phone and email and would urge them to contact the London Health Protection Team as soon as possible. “Anyone who suspects they might have Monkeypox, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, should limit their contact with other people and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as they can.” You can catch monkeypox from an infected animal if you're bitten or you touch its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters, or scabs, the NHS says. Every day I have been calling my clinic, the NHS Trust trying to get people to call me so we can do contact tracing Severe cases can occur and in recent times, the case fatality ratio has been around 3–6%, according to the World Health Organization.  The infection can be transferred through sex and touching items that an infected person has come into contact with. If your symptoms are severe or you're at higher risk of getting seriously ill you may need to stay in a specialist hospital until you recover.

Can you spot the dangerous rashes from the harmless ones?,Terri-Ann Williams,"8:38, 1 Jun 2022","But a  rise in monkeypox cases  has meant that many Brits are being hyper-vigilant when it comes to new marks, lesions and blisters. In the UK there have been 190 detected infections, and while the risk to the public remains low, experts have urged people to get to know the key signs of the monkeypox rash. As we head into the summer months and Brits spend more time out and about, our skin can feel the impact. Dr    previously said ricky subject to discuss without alarming people"". ""The skin is like the window to the body if you like, so sometimes that can be a sign that something is going on inside the body,"" he said. Millions of Brits suffer with common conditions like  eczema ,  psoriasis , and acne. While being incredibly frustrating to live with, they do not pose a serious risk to health. However, experts have warned serious rashes with similar symptoms can be disguised. Read on to find out what your rash symptoms could be really caused by...

Fluid filled spots that later become crusty: Monkeypox Initial signs of monkeypox include a fever,  headache  and muscle aches. A monkyepox rash will usually start of the face, before moving across the rest of the body. A rash will occur within three days after a fever. Ifti Khan,  Well Pharmacy  superintendent explained: ""There are several stages to monkeypox. The first developing into papules and fluid filled pustules before forming a scab and falling off. Monkeypox lesions appear and develop at the same time."" 2. Red or pink spots everywhere: Chickenpox Just last month parents were warned of a  dangerous outbreak  of chickenpox and  scarlet fever infections  - with many families being on high alert. Experts say that many common infections declined during  lockdown  but they're now circulating at higher levels, particularly affecting pre-school and nurseries. Mr Khan said: ""Chickenpox and monkeypox are similar in the way they are spread, via close contact and respiratory droplets, as well as direct contact with contaminated objects, but monkeypox is much rarer and spreads less easily."" One of the  differences between monkeypox and chickenpox  is that people with the latter will usually not experience swollen lymph nodes. ""Chickenpox usually forms in a different way. ""In a chickenpox rash the spots do not develop uniformly and appear at different times,"" he added. 4. A patchy red rash that can turn scaly: Lymphoma Mycosis fungoides is a common rash in patients diagnosed with lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system - the network of tissues and organs in our body that work to rid us of toxins. It can be particularly dangerous because the cancerous cells can travel through the body in the bloodstream. The cancer cells can then grow in several places at once, affecting multiple parts of the body. A person with lymphoma may develop mycosis fungoides, a rash that is caused when the blood travels to the upper layer of the skin. In its early stages it may appear as a patchy red rash but as it progresses it tends to become scaly. It may be itchy and look  similar to eczema. 5. Tiny red spots covering the skin: Leukaemia Leukaemia, a type of  blood cancer  that starts in the bone marrow, can spread throughout the body in the bloodstream. A person with leukaemia may also develop tiny red spots on their skin known as petechiae. The rash is caused by broken blood vessels under the skin. Children may also develop a rash called acute myelogenous leukaemia, which causes dark spots to appear on the skin. 7. Reddish rash on your hands or back: Any cancer Dermatomyositis tends to appear as changes around your nail folds, a reddish rash on the back of your hands, especially around the knuckles, and a shawl-like red rash on your back. This rash can be associated with any type of cancer. It can also appear on your face, eyelids, chest, knees and elbows. Dermatomyositis can also cause muscle weakness and inflamed muscles. 8. Dark, thicker patches of skin: Cancer or diabetes Acanthosis nigricans is when darker, thickened patches of skin develop around the armpit, groin and neck. It's not a condition in itself but a sign of an underlying health problem. The patches will be dry and rough, feeling similar to velvet, and can also be itchy. Acanthosis nigricans usually develops slowly over time but spreading quickly has be linked to cancer. A dark patch (or band) of velvety skin on the back of your neck, armpit, groin, or elsewhere could mean that you have too much insulin in your blood - a sign of diabetes. While diabetes itself is not deadly, it has a number of serious complications from heart attacks to amputations, so it is vital to get an early diagnosis.7 Necrotising fasciitis BUT... in most cases a rash is harmless With skin rashes linked to so many serious diseases, including cancer, Dr Hussain reassured most of the time, a rash is harmless. ""The most common cause of a rash will NOT be cancer related.  I think that is a really important message to give to people,"" he said.

Monkeypox status upgraded as doctors urged to report infections to local councils,Terri-Ann Williams,"15:35, 7 Jun 2022","DOCTORS who come across monkeypox patients will now have to inform local councils and health protection services. As more  cases of the illness  are identified, new legislation will come into play tomorrow to help curb the spread. It means that  monkeypox  will be designated a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Other illnesses that also fall under this legislation include  Covid-19 , the  Plague , acute  meningitis ,  measles  and  smallpox . Labs must also inform the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) if a case is detected in samples. If monkeypox is suspected, medics must tell the correct authorities within three days or within 24 hours for urgent cases. Wendi Shepherd, Monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: “Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of Monkeypox.  ""This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. “It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.” Yesterday a further 73 cases of the infection were detected, bringing the total in the  UK to 301 .

Experts at the UKHSA said they will update Brits every three days on the growing spread. The current outbreak is unusual because the virus is typically only found in parts of Africa. But it has spread globally in recent weeks, with health experts investigating key chains of transmission. Prof David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: ""Making monkeypox a notifiable disease suggests a desire to be sure to have reporting from all sectors (public and private) and all parts of the NHS. It suggests that the government wants to focus surveillance on the entire population - not only on the risk groups identified so far.  ""This will permit clear identification of all risk groups and help better understand the epidemiology and extent of spread.” Anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases have been seen in gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men. Despite this, experts say there is not one singular clear risk factor for picking up the virus. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said cases may be more prevalent among people in the gay community because they are more likely to come forward to sexual health clinics when they have  symptoms . The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash . The rash develops into painful blisters before scabbing - and a person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off. The UKHSA said people should contact a sexual health clinic if they have a blistered rash and have been in close contact with someone who might have monkeypox within the past three weeks.

It brings the total to 214 as of June 2, with the  majority in London . There have been at least 550 cases of  monkeypox  seen worldwide since early May, the most of which are in the UK. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the number of cases seen so far could be  the “tip of the iceberg”. But experts say the risk to the public remains ""low"". The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) say  the virus  has so far been mostly detected in one community.  Most cases are known to be gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Only two cases have been in women. The UKHSA said today: “Anyone can get  monkeypox .  ""Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men, so it’s particularly important to be aware of the symptoms if you’re in these groups.” The key symptoms of monkeypox include a flu-like illness of fever, chills, and muscle aches, followed by a  chickenpox-like rash .

But in a report released on Wednesday night, the UKHSA stated that dating apps and bars used predominantly by gay people have linked cases. It said: “Investigations to date have identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad.  “Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified.” Researchers of a new study published on Thursday also noted “ links to sex  on premises venues, private sex parties, and the use of geospatial dating apps, both in the UK and abroad"". Published in  Eurosurveillance , the study investigated cases of monkeypox in the UK, grouping patients into three groups. One group was cases among those who had travelled from Africa, the second was household transmission, and the third was had no links to travel or previously confirmed cases. Of the 79 people in group three, all were men, and the majority (66) identified as gay, bisexual, or as men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, which just means that it’s consistently present, and accounts for some 9,000 cases a year. But it has been unusually spreading in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and other parts of the world. Experts now say there is evidence of community transmission in the UK. It may have been spreading in non-endemic cases “under the radar” for a while, the WHO has said. While health teams race to find more people with the virus through contact tracing, one expert has said it could be  hard to “stamp it out”. Professor John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the fact that so many infections have been “cropping up all over the world” indicated there was “going to be a problem”. “You’re not going to get rid of it overnight,” he told  The Independent. “It’s going to take a good couple of months of really solid work to chase up all the infections and contacts and stamp it out. It will take a while.” In most cases monkeypox is a mild disease and clears up on its own. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak. The signs may include - according to the UKHSA and previous medical reports: 2. Headache 3. Muscle aches 4. Backache 5. Chills 6. Exhaustion 7. Night sweats 8.

Parents rush to get chickenpox jabs as cases of monkeypox surge – how to tell them apart,Terri-Ann Williams,"9:27, 31 May 2022","PARENTS have rushed to get their kids vaccinated against chickenpox due to fears surrounding an uptick in monkeypox infections. In the last six weeks the number of people who have had a jab for  chickenpox  has gone up by 146 per cent. Data from Well Pharmacy shows that this is double the number of doses usually rolled out. Experts say that this could be down to the confusion between the two viruses - which both produce a rash. The chickenpox jabs cost £130 and are not available for free on the NHS and will not protect you from monkeypox. Because the monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, people are given the smallpox jab to protect against the bug. In the UK, anyone who has been in contact with a monkeypox case is being given the smallpox jab. A  further 71 cases  of monkeypox were last night detected in the UK, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 179. The first case in Britain  was recorded on May 7,  but numbers have since jumped , with hundreds around the world.

I’m a doctor – here’s how to tell if your child’s rash is really monkeypox,Terri-Ann Williams,"9:36, 25 May 2022","INFECTIONS of monkeypox are spreading globally and Brits have been warned to be on the lookout for rashes and lesions. A child in London is known to have contracted the illness, with many  parents now worrying  about marks their children are coming home with. Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Now one medic has revealed how you can tell if your child's rash is really monkeypox - or if it's down to something else entirely. Paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Dr David Porter said parents should not worry about their children having monkeypox as cases in youngsters are rare. So far in the UK  71 cases of the virus  have been detected, after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) last night revealed 14 more infections. One child in London is in intensive care, and  symptoms  are thought to be the same in youngsters as they are in adults. Dr Porter said  parents  should be reassured to follow what they would usually do if their child has a rash - unless a child has had known contacted with someone who has the illness. ""As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don’t think parents should be worried about this being… monkeypox at this stage, because we’re seeing a very low number of cases. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we’ve seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it’s been predominantly in adults anyway. “And without any contact history with somebody that’s known or strongly felt to have monkeypox, and then if you’ve got a rash at this time of year when we’ve seen lots of rashes from chickenpox and other things in children, hand, foot and mouth disease, then that’s what it’s likely to be,"" he explained. When it comes to the difference between rashes, it's the symptoms that sit alongside the illness that are different.  If your child has  chickenpox  rather than monkeypox, they will also suffer aches and pains, as well as a loss of appetite which is not a key symptom of monkeypox. The rashes are similar, but a  chickenpox rash  usually looks more inflamed, and is harder to spot on darker skin. Symptoms for  hand foot and mouth  are similar to chickenpox, but they vary from monkeypox in that usually, patients will have mouth ulcers which also appear on the tongue. AT RISK As a parent, medics say adults are more likely to get the illness than children. So if you get it and are looking after your little one, there is the likelihood - as with any illness that you could pass it on to them. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said the illness is ""relatively mild"" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"", Dr Hopkins said, and are like ""a viral illness"". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. ""It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,"" Dr Hopkins said. ""They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious."" Medics  say the fatality rate in children is between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms.

Four of the UK's confirmed cases are in Scotland, two are in Northern Ireland, one is in Wales and the rest are in England.

WHO's pandemic preparedness and prevention chief Sylvie Briand said: ""We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days."" MONKEYPOX SPREADS However, the expert added it is ""not a disease the general public should be worried about"". ""It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast."" In recent weeks, the virus has been identified in several countries across Britain and the west, including Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. Symptoms include  fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. Top Brit medic Dr Susan Hopkins said: "" We anticipated that further cases would be detected  through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals. We are still at the very, very beginning of this event. We know that we will have more cases in the coming days “We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. “Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. ""We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. “We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice."" The virus can be  significantly more harmful in young children.   Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, says  the medical community is bracing for more cases as the virus spreads. ""It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks,"" she said.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18733007/monkeypox-cases-rise-uk-new-infections/,The Sun
"Monkeypox outbreak ‘likely sparked by sex at two raves in Spain and Belgium’, WHO warns",Vanessa Chalmers,"9:30, 24 May 2022","A WORLD health leader has said sex occuring at two raves in Europe could be behind the mystery monkeypox outbreaks.  Monkeypox  is not known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Health officials have said a notable proportion of the cases in Britain and Europe have been in young men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.  They have had no travel to  Africa , where the disease is endemic and typically spread through the handling of infected monkeys.  Professor David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO's emergencies department, said the leading theory “was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and  Belgium ”, AP reported. He said it is one hypothesis among many. 'Not a gay disease' Experts are stressing that monkeypox is not a ""gay disease"" just because patients presenting with symptoms are men who have sex with men (MSM). Dr Ranj Singh, and NHS doctor and TV personality, wrote in  Attitude magazine : ""It’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts has allowed more rapid spread.  ""We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all.  ""And we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’."" Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence ""It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply."" Andrew Lee, Professor of Public Health, University of Sheffield, said gay and bisexual men have suffered ""tremendously over the years"" due to the stigma with HIV.  He wrote in the  Conversation : ""We need to get across the message that monkeypox is not a disease of men who have sex with men.  ""It is not about sexuality: people tend to be infected through close physical contact and it does not have to be sexual in nature."" He added that outbreaks could also occur among straight groups, including sports teams or simply a circle of friends.  European hotspots The two events DrHeymann was referring to were a Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria and  a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp,  Belgium .  Some men have gotten a diagnosis after they sought help for skin rashes at sexual health clinics. The WHO states: ""The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic."" A rash  which looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters, and then scabbing, is the main  symptom of monkeypox .  It appears a couple of days after flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache and chills.  Dr Heymann said it’s known that monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, “and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission”. THE NHS only has enough space to treat 50 monkeypox patients, as cases continue to rise in the UK. Guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) states that all confirmed cases need to be transferred to high consequence infectious disease (HCID) units if they need hospital care. But just 15 beds are believed to have existed before Covid- with the spread of the virus ramping up capacity. Now sources say there are only 50 beds and many people will have to quarantine at home, the  MailOnline  reported. Experts said there is 'always a risk beds will run out', especially if the situation 'deteriorates further'. It's unclear whether the HCID units were kept following the pandemic, with many centres having being closed. Around 57 Brits have the illness, with more cases having been announced yesterday. Number 10 is 'keeping an eye' on the situation - but travel restrictions have been ruled out. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia said the number of beds available depends on how many cases would need that level of care. He said: ""The concern is that in the 2018 outbreak, the case infected a health worker and that was thought to be while they were changing the bedding because the flakes from their scabs were spread.  ""Patients have to be kept in the specialist unit to avoid the spread."" An NHS spokesperson said: ""The NHS has tried and tested plans in place for treating sporadic cases of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, through a network of highly specialised centres providing expert care. ""The NHS is working closely with UKHSA to ensure the small number of people identified are treated in line with their guidance."" But he said there was unlikely to be widespread transmission of the virus, and the outbreak might be traceable to a single infection. It's very possible that somebody with the  monkeypox rash  on their hands or genitals spread it to someone else through physical touch. This helped seed the outbreak around the world, into the US and other European countries, Dr Heymann theorised.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), urged people - especially men who have sex with men - to be alert to symptoms. She said: “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms.   “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” There are now  56 cases  of monkeypox in England, and one in Scotland.  The UKHSA has said the threat to the public remains low. While the monkeypox is concerning experts, they have reassured it is “not another Covid”. He said it does not spread in the air - although can be passed from sneezing and coughing - and we have vaccines to protect against it. The UK is  stockpiling  jabs against the virus which will only be given to those who are deemed at high risk after being in contact with a case. The vaccine was designed to fight smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, before being discontinued.  But it is also 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, given they are similar viruses of the same family - although the former is more mild. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said Monday there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme in the UK. It comes after  a British tourist  staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is tested for monkeypox. The holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura is one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed, health chiefs in the region said. Monkeypox is a viral infectious disease. This particular virus is a rare zoonosis, this means that it is transmitted to humans from an animal. It primarily occurs in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rain forests. In Africa, human infections have been documented through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels. It spreads between humans only through close contact. Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with the skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by the patient. Monkeypox has a mortality rate of between one and 10 per cent, with most deaths occurring in younger age groups. Initial symptoms include: A painful rash and open sores can then develop, usually starting on the face. Symptoms generally last from 14 to 21 days, with severe cases relating to age, the extent of virus exposure, the patient's health and the severity of complications.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/18666999/monkeypox-outbreak-likely-sparked-sex-raves-spain-belguim-who/,The Sun
UK’s total monkeypox infections hits 106 as further 16 cases identified,Terri-Ann Williams,"15:21, 27 May 2022","A FURTHER 16 cases of monkeypox have been detected in the UK, fresh data has revealed. The UK Health Security Agency has urged Brits to be on the look out for blisters on any part of their body. Initial symptoms include a headache and the illness will often feel like a viral infection. It was today revealed that scientists working with smallpox-like viruses first warned about a monkeypox epidemic four years ago. In 2018 Porton Down scientist warns of potential 'devastating consequences' of monkeypox. Then in February 2022 scientists said monkeypox is a disease in 'resurgence' in a research review in the  Neglected Tropical Diseases  journal.  It was published just a few months before the current outbreak. In England, 101 people have the bug, with three cases having been detected in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The cases in Scotland are said to be in people with “recent travel history”, according to Public Health Scotland. Health officials added that close contacts of the affected people were being identified and provided with health information, advice and, where appropriate, a vaccine.

It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: ""We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.

"Brits are ‘overloading’ NHS 111 ‘because anyone who gets a rash’ thinks they have monkeypox, health chief warns",Emma James,"9:53, 28 May 2022","BRITS are swamping the NHS over fears their rash might be linked to the monkeypox outbreak.  Health chiefs are urging those who are worried they are  suffering from the virus  to contact sexual health clinics rather than bombarding 111.  Head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Mateo Prochazka wants staff to be able to focus on handling other health queries.  Mr Prochazka told  The Daily Telegraph : “Sexual health clinics are not just for gay and bisexual men.  ""Anyone can be seen in a sexual health clinic, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or identity. Everyone is welcome. “There are other potential routes of trying to get yourself into the system, maybe calling NHS 111, but this resource has been really overloaded with everyone calling who had a rash.” Another 16 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK, meaning there are 106 cases in total.  The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which means it can take three weeks for symptoms to appear. They include suffering from a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body — including the genitals.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Health officials are planning on isolating infected people's pets in an attempt to stop the outbreak.  The Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group has advised the government that rodents, rabbits, squirrels and hedgehogs are at the highest risk of catching the virus, and they could spread it into wild populations. Experts fear that if the virus is unleashed into wild animal populations then it will become endemic and be increasingly difficult to eradicate. All of the new patients are based in England, with the first case detected on May 6 and Wales and Northern Ireland declaring their first cases on Thursday.  The World Health Organization has warned that 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning. Monkeypox  is not known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex, possibly through contaminated items such as bed linen, clothing and towels. 'RESOURCES OVERLOADED' Officials are confident that the outbreak will not reach the levels of covid, believing that the risk to the public is low.  But they have urged Brits, especially gay and bisexual men, to be on the look out for any new rashes or lesions.   Teams from the UKHSA have been contacting high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising them to self-isolate at home for three weeks and avoid contact with children. Both confirmed cases and close contacts are being offered the Imvanex vaccine to form a buffer of immune people around a confirmed case to limit the spread of the disease. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  “If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18712484/brits-overloading-nhs-rash-health-chief-monkeypox/,The Sun
I survived the last US monkeypox outbreak – the warning symptoms to look out for and how to protect yourself,Cheyenne R. Ubiera,"6:07, 24 May 2022","A MONKEYPOX survivor is sharing his experience with the virus as an increasing number of states report suspected cases. Cases have now been  confirmed in the US , United Kingdom, Portugal, and Italy, while potential cases are being investigated in Canada and Spain. Nearly 20 years ago, Wisconsin had its own outbreak and the new cases hold painful memories for survivor Dr Kurt Zaeske. Back in 2003, he was a veterinarian who came in contact with the virus from a prairie dog he was treating. “Within about 48 hours of my handling that specimen, I became ill,” he told local news outlet  WISN . Zaeske developed lesions similar to chickenpox and suffered from nausea, dizziness, and a high fever. “I started developing a blister on my thumb that didn't look right, didn't act right,” he said back in 2003, after being quarantined for two weeks. Cases across the state sprouted up at the time, causing health officials to warn the public. Dr Seth Foldy was the Milwaukee Health Commissioner. “Direct contact with the skin lesion of monkeypox can transmit the virus,” he said in 2003. In the US, 71 cases of monkeypox were reported in 2003 and 39 of those cases were in Wisconsin.

""There is a process within the state of Wisconsin and in the Milwaukee Health Department with how you manage the communicable disease, of which monkeypox is one, and we're prepared to manage it."" Zaeske believes that the public is more prepared now, compared to 19 years ago. “We did not know what was going to happen (then),” he said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one case of monkeypox has been confirmed in Massachusetts.  A possible case  was reported in Bellevue Hospital  in New York City. “We are investigating a possible case of monkeypox in NYC,” read a tweet from the  @nycHealthy  account. “Our Public Health Lab will conduct preliminary tests, which - if positive - will be sent to  @CDCgov  for confirmatory testing. “The Department’s epidemiologists will follow up with any individual who may have been in contact with the patient while infectious,” read  a statement  from the Department of Health and Hygiene in the state. MONKEYPOX SYMPTOMS There are two main strains of the virus: the Congo strain, which has a 10 percent mortality rate, and the West African strain, which only has a fatality rate of one percent. Spots often start on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, experts say. The disease is a viral infection, similar to smallpox but milder. The rash affects the face mostly (95 percent of cases) and hands (75 percent), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). During the illness, the rash changes from raised red bumps to spots filled with fluid.  The spots eventually erupt and form scabs, which later fall off. The infection causes two periods of illness.

UK detects another 14 cases of monkeypox – taking total to 71,Vanessa Chalmers,"15:50, 24 May 2022","FOURTEEN more cases of monkeypox have been announced by UK health officials today. It brings England’s total since early May to 70, with an additional  monkeypox  case reported in Scotland. As of May 23, no cases have so far been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. Despite further cases being detected, the risk to the UK population remains low, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, warned people to be aware of  ""rashes or lesions  on any part of their body"". She said this was particularly important if someone has a new sexual partner. ""They should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person,"" she said.  A rash is a key  symptom of the monkeypox  virus.  At first it looks similar to chickenpox, before developing into pus-filled blisters which eventually scab over. A person is infectious until their scabs have fallen off, and experts warn the bug can be caught from objects they touch, such as bedding, towels or utensils.

They are being advised to  isolate  themselves at home for up to 21 days. In addition, UKHSA has purchased supplies of a  smallpox vaccine  called Imvanex which is being offered to close contacts of someone diagnosed with monkeypox. Although the vaccine is against smallpox - a virus declared eradicated in 1980 - it is shown to be 85 per cent effective against the similar monkeypox virus. But most Brits won’t have had it, given it was discontinued upon the eradication of smallpox.  Worldwide spread Health authorities in Europe, North America, Israel and Australia have identified more than 100 cases of monkeypox in recent days. The outbreak is unusual because it is affecting countries where monkeypox is not endemic. It is only endemic in parts of Africa, where there are some 9,000 cases per year, and humans are typically infected by animals.  Health officials are still investigating, but a top adviser to the WHO said this week that the leading theory is that monkeypox was likely spread after sexual activity at  two recent raves in Europe . Most cases have been in men who have sex with men, including those who are gay and bisexual. However, experts have stressed the importance of avoiding a ""gay disease"" label, which could lead to stigma, and therefore further spread.  It may just be unlucky that monkeypox happened to get into this one particular community first, said Dr Jake Dunning, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Oxford. It's just that they are a community and by having sex with each other, that is how it's spreading, he said. While  monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. About six per cent of cases are fatal, the WHO.

"Monkeypox could get better at infecting humans and lead to major outbreaks, scientists warn",Terri-Ann Williams,"13:19, 2 Jun 2022","THE monkeypox virus could get better at infecting humans and lead to major outbreaks, experts have warned. So far, there have been  190 confirmed  cases of  monkeypox  identified from 6th to 31st May in the UK. A total of 183 were in England, four were in Scotland, two were in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Looking at England’s cases, the UK Health Security Agency revealed that  86 per cent were in London  - with 132 infections in the capital. As the spread continues globally, scientists have said the recent outbreaks are an 'accumulation of years of warnings that basically went ignored'. Monkeypox is usually found in Western African, and due to that, medics say other countries don't often pay attention. Scientist and infectious diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Dr Boghuma Titanji said researchers have long been concerned that it could fill the gap left by smallpox. ""If given the opportunity to spread unchecked ... it could get better at infecting humans and lead to bigger outbreaks than what we've seen in the past,"" she told  CBC News . The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that some 550 cases have been reported in the latest spike in infections across 30 countries where the virus is not commonly found.

Speaking at a press conference on monkeypox,  Covid-19  and other global health issues he said: ""Investigations are ongoing, but the sudden appearance of monkeypox in many countries at the same time suggests there may have been undetected transmission for some time. “WHO is urging affected countries to widen their surveillance, to look for cases in the broader community. “Anyone can be infected with monkeypox if they have close physical contact with someone else who is infected. Experts at the UK Health Security Agency have said all Brits should be on the look out for key signs and symptoms. The signs may include: Medics said that complications of the illness were documented as: “It’s important to remember that generally, monkeypox symptoms resolve on their own, but it can be severe in some cases.” Dr Rosamund Lewis added that right now, monkeypox is in the 'outbreak' stage and could be stopped. She said that there is cause for concern, as it's not yet clear how long the virus has been in circulation for. “So we don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain, what WHO and all member states are certainly trying to do is to prevent onward spread.” Due to the spread, Brits have been urged to look out for any new lesions or blisters that may appear.

The full list of 14 monkeypox symptoms you must not ignore – from low mood to blisters,Vanessa Chalmers,"11:45, 26 May 2022","MONKEYPOX is spreading in the UK and Brits are being told to stay alert to the symptoms. The virus  is not new, having been endemic in parts of Africa for decades.  However, people in countries where the virus has recently appeared may not be familiar with  monkeypox  symptoms. There have been very few cases in the UK historically, with the  first only in 2018 . But in May alone, some  78 infections  have now been detected. Researchers published a paper this week that detailed the cases of seven people  previously infected  with monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021. They had all been watched closely in hospital, where they stayed for between ten and 39 days. Patients reported early symptoms of fever, night sweats, cold-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes and groin.  They then developed the  rash characteristic of monkeypox  one to four days later.  But some patients had no early signs, and developed a rash straight away, the paper published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases revealed.

Arms, legs and hands were also common.  Five of the seven developed the rash around their genitalia. These reports, together with the list of symptoms compiled by the UKHSA, helps build a picture of how monkeypox presents. The signs may include: 1.Fever 2. Headache 3. Muscle aches 4. Backache 5. Chills 6. Exhaustion 7. Night sweats 8. Cold-like symptoms, such as congestion and runny nose 9. Swollen lymph nodes 10. Swollen groin 11. Rash Complications of the illness were documented as: 12. Low mood 13. Severe pain 14. Conjunctivitis The rash and its blisters appeared on locations: ‘I thought I’d lose my thumb’ Meanwhile, a veterinarian who caught monkeypox in 2003 has come forward to describe his illness. Dr Kurt Zaeske told  NBC  he suffered “flu-like symptoms” including a fever, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and a headache. Then he started developing small lesions on his body, including ""one significant blister that developed on my thumb, and that became quite painful."" He said: ""My biggest fear was that I was going to lose my thumb and not be able to practice anymore.” Dr Zaeske caught monkeypox from a dog who had likely been infected by a rodent. He was part of the biggest and first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa, when more than 70 cases were identified in the US, all linked to infected dogs. But the current outbreak is set to challenge that. The number of confirmed cases of monkeypox worldwide has reached 219 outside of countries where it is endemic, according to the European Union's disease agency. More than a dozen countries where monkeypox is unusual, mostly in Europe, have reported at least one confirmed case, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said on Wednesday. It added that most of the cases were detected in young men, self-identifying as men who have sex with men. The UKHSA has said many patients had been diagnosed after going to a sexual health clinic with a rash. But it has warned that people who have had multiple sexual partners - regardless of sexual orientation - are more at risk. Monkeypox spread through close physical contact, which includes sex. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18693081/full-list-monkeypox-symptoms/,The Sun
The 4 groups at highest risk of monkeypox revealed as cases set to rise,Terri-Ann Williams,"11:56, 24 May 2022","CASES of monkeypox are rising across the globe with more set to be identified in the coming days. Last night medical chiefs confirmed a further  36 infections  had been recorded in England. It brings the total to 56, with one case also being reported in Scotland yesterday. The  monkeypox  outbreak, now spanning some 20 countries, is mystifying health leaders. It is endemic in West and Central Africa, but extremely  rare elsewhere . However, between 100 and 200 confirmed and suspected cases have been detected in recent weeks across the world. The key signs to look out for include a fever and headache, but officials have warned that some groups are more at risk than others when it comes to catching the illness. The  World Health Organisation  (WHO) says that anyone who has close physical contact with someone who has symptoms of monkeypox, or with an infected animal are at highest risk of infection.  Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence Medics explained that newborns are at risk - just as they are with other illnesses, due to the fact that their immune systems have not yet been fully formed - meaning they are more susceptible to infection. They added: ""Newborns, children and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.  ""Health workers are also at higher risk due to longer virus exposure."" Those who are vaccinated against smallpox are likely to have some protection against the monkeypox infection. Currently people who have been in contact with those infected are being given the vaccine as a precaution. Experts at the WHO said: ""Younger people are unlikely to have been vaccinated against smallpox because smallpox vaccination stopped worldwide after smallpox became the first human disease to be eradicated in 1980.  Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. ""Even though people who have been vaccinated against smallpox will have some protection against monkeypox, they also need to take precautions to protect themselves and others."" Health officials have said a notable proportion of cases in the UK and Europe have been in young men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on May 20 said a number of early cases had been detected in gay and bisexual men. Because of this, the agency said it is urging this community to be particularly alert. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: ""Clinicians should be alert to any individual presenting with unusual rashes without a clear alternative diagnosis and should contact specialist services for advice."" 'RAPID SPREAD' However, monkeypox is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But it can be spread through sexual contact when someone touches the lesions of an infected person. It can be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. Coughs and sneezes are also a mode of transmission. NHS doctor and TV star, Dr Ranj Singh said the global spread is worrying, as there doesn't seem to be a clear connection between travel - suggesting that it is spreading through humans. Dr Ranj stressed that the high proportion of cases in men who have sex with men does not mean it is a ""gay disease"". He  told Attitude magazine: ""It’s quite possible that the introduction of the virus into networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts has allowed more rapid spread. ""We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all. ""And we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of HIV being a ‘gay disease’. ""It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply.  ""So this community should definitely be on increased alert,"" he told  Attitude . The WHO added: ""The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic.""

Experts warn monkeypox could become ‘permanent’ in Europe if it spreads to PETS,Britta Zeltmann,"23:14, 23 May 2022","EXPERTS have warned monkeypox could become permanent in Europe if pets start catching it too.  A total of 57 cases have been confirmed in Britain so far, with all but one of them in England.   The rare virus has also spread across 20 countries in Europe, with  Brits already warned to be ""alert"" when they hit holiday hotspots  this year. There have still not been any reports of monkeypox in pets, but in a rapid risk assessment on Monday, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said it was important to “manage exposed pets and prevent the disease from being transmitted to wildlife”. Issuing the update, the ECDC said: “If human-to-animal transmission occurs, and the virus spreads in an animal population, there is a risk that the disease could become endemic in Europe. “Rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans, and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. “Such a spill-over event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis. The probability of this spill-over event is very low.” Prof David Robertson, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, told  the Telegraph  this was a “valid concern”. He said: “It would seem sensible to monitor any animals/pets that infected people are in contact with."" Experts believe rodents, such as rats and squirrels, can harbour the virus but the full range of animals at risk is not yet known.

Health chiefs have warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, however can be passed on through  skin-to-skin contact during sex . It causes flu-like symptoms before a  blistering rash  spreads across the body. Festivals  - attended by Europeans on holiday - have been tied to outbreaks across the region, including in Spain, Italy and Germany.  And the World Health Organization (WHO) said the explosion of cases is “a highly unusual event”. The agency’s Europe director, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could fuel the spread of  monkeypox . Dr Kluge  said : ""I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the  symptoms  are unfamiliar to many."" Asked about the risk to Brits going to summer festivals or going on holiday, chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said people “need to be alert” to the virus. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind.  ""What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" Before now, there had only been eight cases of  monkeypox in the UK , all with links to travel from West Africa. But that's not the case for this outbreak, which has now seen at least  57 in the UK  infected. There is already community transmission in the UK - but the UKHSA stresses that the risk to the public is ""low"". Many more are expected to be diagnosed in the coming weeks, experts say. Dr Hopkins comments came as some of Europe’s top holiday destinations reported outbreaks of the virus. There are around 100 cases across Europe and Northern America, the WHO said Monday. The full list of European countries with  monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have  cases And elsewhere in the world: A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox ""mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans. VAX DASH It comes as the EU’s infectious-disease agency prepares to tell member states to prepare vaccination programmes, according to the  Financial Times. Any jab initiatives would use an existing smallpox vaccine that also offers 85 per cent efficacy against monkeypox.  The two virsues cause similar symptoms, although smallpox was eradicated by 1980 thanks to the jabs.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme in the UK. It came despite Health Secretary Sajid Javid ordering a further  20,000 doses  of the smallpox jab on top of the 5,000 already secured.  ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers,"" the PM's spokesperson said. ""But given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign."" The outbreaks are atypical, according to the WHO, as they are occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate.  Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. But as of yet, the WHO does not have evidence the virus has mutated. WHO said confirmed cases have so far been the less severe West African group of monkeypox viruses.  MP Simon Clarke, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said this was not ""some repeat of Covid"". He said: ""We are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18665184/monkeypox-warning-permanent-europe-pets/,The Sun
Holiday warning after monkeypox fears hit favourite UK summer break destination as Brit tourist tested,,"8:22, 24 May 2022","A BRITISH tourist staying at a favourite holiday hotspot in Spain is being tested for monkeypox. Health chiefs in the region confirmed the holidaymaker on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura was one of five suspected new cases currently being analysed. The age of the unnamed man, thought to be the first British tourist in Spain affected since the country announced its first cases last week, has not been revealed. A spokesman for the Canary Islands’ Health Service confirmed in a short statement: “A suspected case of  monkeypox  in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist.” It is not yet known when they will confirm whether he has the disease. Authorities have not said if he is holidaying alone on the island or relaxing with relatives who are also being tested. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of  monkeypox  and said another 67 people are being tested. The outbreaks have been traced to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Gran Canaria pride festival attended by 80,000 people from Britain and other European countries. News of the suspected Fuerteventura case follows warnings by chief medical advisor Dr Susan Hopkins for people to be “alert to the virus” on holiday. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population remains extremely low.

"UK detects another eight monkeypox cases, bringing total to 90",Terri-Ann Williams,"17:03, 26 May 2022","A FURTHER eight monkeypox cases have been detected in the UK, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 90. The risk to the population remains low, but health officials have urged Brits to be alert to  rashes and new lesions  on any part of the body. In England, 85 people have the infection, with three cases having been confirmed in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The cases in Scotland are said to be in people with “recent travel history”, according to Public Health Scotland. Health officials added that close contacts of the affected people were being identified and provided with health information, advice and, where appropriate, a vaccine. Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas.

At present, anyone who has been in contact with someone who has caught the infection will be given a dose. Anyone who has the bug has to isolate and Brits have been told to be aware of the key signs when it comes to infection. Medics have said the advice applies to everyone, but added that the majority of cases have been detected in gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men. Experts are therefore asking people in these groups to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “We are continuing to promptly identify further Monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms. “If anyone suspects they might have rashes or lesions on any part of their body, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.” Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Is monkeypox deadly?,Danni Scott,"11:44, 24 May 2022","A SMALL outbreak of monkeypox has caused concern in Europe and the USA but many people are unaware of the virus.  Monkeypox  is more often seen in Africa than in Western countries but is  not unheard of in the UK .  Is monkeypox deadly?  Monkeypox  comes from the same family of viruses as  smallpox  but is much less severe. No deaths have been reported  from the 2022 outbreak of the disease in the UK.  The chance of catching monkeypox in the UK is very low as  cases are rare.  Cases have been linked to some  festivals in Europe .  According to the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) up to a tenth of people who contract the virus may die but this is mainly in younger age groups.  The majority of those who catch monkeypox will survive.  How dangerous is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is very rare so unless you have been to West or Central  Africa  or been in contact with someone who has it, there is little reason to worry. The disease is transmitted through contact with blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs of an infected individual.  I thought I had Covid & feared I'd die in agony in hospital - it was  monkeypox Monkeypox cases hit 9,492 in US with Biden declaring virus health emergency I was interrogated, humiliated and 'thrown off' a flight over my ECZEMA Urgent monkeypox warning amid fears virus will become endemic in the UK Animals can also be infected as the disease originated from them, meaning if you are bitten by an infected animal you can also catch monkeypox.  It is possible to become infected by touching the clothes or bed sheets which have been used by someone with Monkeypox.  This means that the danger of contracting the disease is low, with around 20 cases confirmed in the UK currently.  If you do catch monkeypox, you are very unlikely to die from it. What is the public health advice?  The  NHS  suggests that it is rare that anyone in the UK who has not been in contact with an infected person or travelled to Africa recently will have the virus.  If you are infected you should isolate and inform the NHS. Nevertheless, they suggest washing your hands regularly with soap or hand sanitiser and only eating meat which has been fully cooked. They also have a list of things to avoid: What is monkeypox?  Monkeypox is a rare infection that comes from wild animals such as rodents and primates.  It was first discovered in 1958 when two colonies of monkeys broke out in pox-like symptoms, hence the name.  The first case of a human infected with the virus was in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is not exclusive to any particular members of the population and is  not an STI .  What are the symptoms? The most prominent  symptom of monkeypox  is the rash which forms in the second stage of the illness.  Initial symptoms are:  These can appear between five to 21 days after infection.  The rash starts one to five days after the other symptoms begin, it can be confused with chicken pox in the early stages. Spots turn into small fluid-filled blisters, which scab over and then fall off. Most people suffer from monkeypox for about two weeks.

UK’s total monkeypox cases reach 78 as a further 7 infections detected,Terri-Ann Williams,"16:14, 25 May 2022","A FURTHER seven people have tested positive for monkeypox in the UK, fresh data has revealed. Anyone with unusual rashes or legions on their body has been urged to contact 111 or visit their local sexual health service.  Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally.

Protections teams have said that anyone who has been risk assessed and remains well, should isolate at home for 21 days. In order to protect the community, the UKHSA has stockpiled smallpox vaccines. At present those who have been in contact with identified cases are being given the jab. Health authorities in Europe, North America, Israel and Australia have identified more than 100 cases of monkeypox in recent days. The outbreak is unusual because it is affecting countries where monkeypox is not endemic. It is only endemic in parts of Africa, where there are some 9,000 cases per year, and humans are typically infected by animals. The NHS says the first signs of the illness are: Medics said that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. Health officials are still investigating, but a top adviser to the WHO said this week that the leading theory is that monkeypox was likely spread after sexual activity at  two recent raves in Europe . Most cases have been in men who have sex with men, including those who are gay and bisexual. However, experts have stressed the importance of avoiding a ""gay disease"" label, which could lead to stigma, and therefore further spread. It may just be unlucky that monkeypox happened to get into this one particular community first, said Dr Jake Dunning, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Oxford. It's just that they are a community and by having sex with each other, that is how it's spreading, he said. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

"Ignore the hoohah, monkeypox virus isn’t the new Covid",Rod Liddle,"21:20, 25 May 2022","YIKES! Monkeypox! WTF is all that about? Horrible blisters all over your face. A disease from Africa which has decided to come over here for a bit. Transmissible from animal  to human and vice versa. Don’t s**g any monkeys, then. And if you must, then wear protection. There are currently 78 cases of this illness in the UK. It had been largely confined to people in Africa. It is now  spreading across Europe , mostly among the gay population — though it looks like the NHS and World Health Organisation are playing down the gay side of it. It has also been reported that we should  avoid eating meat , or only eat meat that has been “thoroughly cooked”. What? You can catch it from a medium-rare ribeye steak? How? No, you can’t. I have the feeling that we’re being wound up by folks who seem to be yearning for another pandemic. And another  lockdown . Already, our  beleaguered Prime Minister  has refused to rule out a lockdown. And health protection teams say that anyone who has been risk-assessed for monkey-pox and remains well should  isolate at home for THREE WEEKS . So what’s going on? First things first. No, you can’t catch it from a medium-rare ribeye steak. Or even a very rare ribeye steak. Or a Chicken Zinger or a pork kebab. What wasn’t in the headlines was the KIND of meat you shouldn’t eat. Turns out the riskiest stuff is monkey, squirrel and rat. Bush meat. So try to avoid chowing down on rat biriyani, sauteed squirrel in the basket or chateaubriand de singe (that’s chateau-briand of monkey, you plebs). And if you can’t, then ask the restaurant to make sure it’s well cooked. Transmissible from animal to human and vice versa. Don’t shag any monkeys, then. And if you must, then wear protection. Is it like  Covid , then, and really easy to catch? Nope, it isn’t. Getting jiggy with an infected person may do it, sure. Any exchange of bodily fluids is a risk. But otherwise you are in very little danger. It is MUCH harder to catch than Covid. Does it kill you? Nah. Almost certainly not. There’s a death rate of between one and three per cent, which is quite high, sure. But that’s largely because of the poor health systems in the countries of West Africa, where it is prevalent. Otherwise, it will be a bit uncomfortable for a couple of weeks, maybe three. And you’ll have those blisters, a bit like chicken pox. Then it will go. But what if the virus mutates, like Covid did? And gets more contagious and more lethal? Nope, it almost certainly won’t. Almost all the evidence says monkeypox is a very stable virus, not given to mutating. It tends to behave itself. UNLIKELY TO BE FATAL So all in all, it’s not really very much to write home about, is it? Hard to catch, still very rare and unlikely to be fatal. And yet we’re being whipped up into a bit of frenzy about it. Don’t worry. People have the heebee-jeebees as a consequence of Covid. And now every virus that arrives here is a cause for great wailing and gnashing of teeth. And there will always be those clamouring for another lockdown. Probably because they liked the previous ones so much. So, for the rest of us — carry on, as you were. Nothing much to see here. Unless, tonight, you were planning to elope with an attractive gibbon who has been feeling under the weather recently. THANKS a lot, then, to the greedy members of transport union the RMT for  threatening to bring chaos to the country  on June 6. No trains running anywhere. They’re very proud of this, the union. The country faces rampant inflation and these selfish clowns are determined to make it worse. The average basic pay for a train driver in the UK is £54,000. That’s a lot more than an average teacher’s salary. The Government must not give in to them. BETWEEN FROCK AND A HARD PLACE OVER STATUE DIFFICULT one for the deranged wokies, this. They’ve just unveiled a statue in Halifax to the 19th-century “Gentleman Jack” —  Anne Lister , known as “the first modern lesbian”. Not sure why someone’s sexual preferences warrant a statue. I quite fancy women dressed as pirates but nobody ever suggested knocking up a statue to me. Anyway, the actress Suranne Jones — who plays Lister in  the BBC drama  — attended the opening. But now it has become clear Lister benefited from the slave trade. Oooh, what to do? I suggest that as soon as the statue is unveiled, they cheer for a bit then throw it in the River Calder. I SEE  football violence  is back with a vengeance. Port Vale fans physically attacking Swindon Town players. An Everton fan taunting Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira (and getting a good kicking in return). Northampton fans going doolally on the pitch. A Nottingham Forest fan assaulting a Sheffield United player. My first thought was that if any of this had involved fans from my team, Millwall, there would be statements in Parliament and the ground would be closed. And second, are the authorities really going to proceed with their plans to reintroduce standing at games? KILLER DOGS A CURSE HERE’S another  terminally deluded dog owner  — Chanel Fong, of Wrexham. This is what she said about her American Bully-type hound: “So many people said what a passive dog Cookie was, but Cookie hasn’t attacked Kev, it wasn’t a vicious attack — it was a tragic accident.” What actually happened is that passive, gentle Cookie tried to eat her partner’s dad. And in doing so, killed him. And here’s the thing. Every time I suggest that people who have powerful dogs need their heads examining, a whole bunch of similarly deluded owners will pile in saying what wonderful pets they are. And more and more people will be killed. Meanwhile, a man quoted on Reddit thinks he’s pulled an hilarious prank by calling his dog Askim. So when people enquire as to what his name is, the owner says, “Yep, side splitting, innit?” It’s apparently annoyed people in the park where he walks the pooch. Wherever it is, they seem a miserable bunch. My own dog is called Jessie. But she also is referred to as Lionel Jessie or Didier Dogba (just like Jeremy Clarkson’s hound). Also as Slobberdog Milosevic, after the former Serbian leader, and Otto Scamperer, after a musical conductor. Occasionally, my wife will refer to her as Princess Pickle Paws and I sometimes call her Doggrich Dogg of Doggville. Truth is, dogs don’t give a monkey’s what names they’re called, do they? BORIS SAVED BY WAR GORDON Bennett. They even had a karaoke party while the rest of us were in lockdown! According to the famous  Sue Gray’s  report, there were SIXTEEN separate parties. Or get-togethers. Or p***-ups, call them what you will. One bash went on until four in the morning. At another, someone puked up and two people had a fight. Civil servants, I assume. “Say that again and I’ll shove a bottle of hand sanitiser up your a***, Oliver.” “Yeah, you and whose army, Tarquin, you ponce? I’ll open you up like a can of peaches. ’Ave it, you muppet.” It is infuriating to know that, from Boris Johnson down, they believed the rules they enforced on US were not intended to apply to them. “Do as I say, not as I do. Lock-down is for plebs.” If we ever have another lockdown, will anyone take it seriously? Knowing that THEY won’t? And the Prime Minister is lying through his teeth about it all. There’s no doubt in my mind that if all this had come out BEFORE Putin invaded the Ukraine, Johnson would be dead meat by now. He may still be dead meat with the electorate. But the war has focused the minds of the Tories and I suspect that, rightly or wrongly, Johnson will not be shifted now. WOKE’S A JOKE A BRILLIANT evening of entertainment from  Ricky Gervais’s  new show, Super Nature. The highlight was an unrepeatable section where Ricky, having transitioned to being a woman, pulls a lesbian. Of course, the wokies are going bananas. One said that Ricky, through his jokes, was “literally killing people”. Deranged, no? Two points. As Gervais says, jokes are fiction. They are not the same thing as reality. They are just jokes. And second, any concept, idea or belief that cannot stand a bit of ribbing is almost certainly based upon a misconception. Gervais, meanwhile, goes from strength to strength.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18687532/monkeypox-lockdown-no-reason-worry/,The Sun
I’m a GP – monkeypox is not a ‘gay disease’ and we must not let misinformation spread,Vanessa Chalmers,"16:22, 24 May 2022","THE MONKEYPOX outbreak is infecting people in Europe and the Americas in a way not seen before. Health officials say that the disease has so far appeared to disproportionately affect  gay and bisexual  men - otherwise known as “men who have sex with men” (MSM).  But a GP has cautioned against seeing monkeypox in a similar light to HIV, which could have harmful consequences.  Dr Ranj Singh, an NHS doctor and TV personality, said “we definitely shouldn’t echo the ridiculously inaccurate hysteria of  HIV  being a ‘gay disease’”. Andrew Lee, a professor of Public Health at the University of Sheffield, agreed that “stigma won’t help” - as we “know too well from our experience with HIV”. There have been under 200 cases of monkeypox detected globally by the World Health Organization (WHO) in places considered unusual.  While  monkeypox  has been causing outbreaks in Africa for years - meaning it is endemic there - it is extremely rare outside of the region. Now, countries including the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Spain and many more countries in Europe are reporting cases every day. UK health officials report that gay and bisexual men should be more alert to the symptoms of the virus, given that it is occuring more in their demographic. But that does not mean “this disease only affects men who have sex with men”.

For example, the World Health Organization says it may be because they are more likely to seek medical attention for symptoms. The agency states: “The reason we are currently hearing more reports of cases of monkeypox in communities of men who have sex with men may be because of positive health seeking behaviour in this demographic.” Dr Sigh said it’s possible that the “networks of MSM who may have multiple intimate contacts” has allowed the virus to spread easier among this group of people. However, he added: “We have to be careful here because this doesn’t mean MSM are at fault at all."" In an article for gay magazine  Attitude , he said: “It may just be that MSM networks have incidentally presented the virus with an ideal storm of conditions in which to multiply.” He added that “this community should definitely be on increased alert”.  Meanwhile, Prof Lee said “we need to get across the message that monkeypox is not a disease of men who have sex with men”. He wrote in  The Conversation : “It is not about sexuality: people tend to be infected through close physical contact and it does not have to be sexual in nature.” Physical touch, or handling objects that an infected person has, such as bedding or clothes, can lead to infection.  Prof Lee said: ""It could just as easily have been an outbreak in a heterosexual friendship network, or a group of sports people, or occupational group, or other social groups.” Prof Lee explained the dangers of labelling monkeypox as a “gay disease”. Firstly, people may fail to realise they are at risk of catching it, if they are straight.  Secondly, it risks creating a stigma, which in turn could lead to more spread. Prof Lee said: “There are lessons we need to learn from the  HIV/Aids pandemic .  “Some of the stigma was driven by deeply held religious and cultural beliefs in society that unfairly equated their sexuality with notions of immorality and negative stereotypes of promiscuity.  “Gay and bisexual men were blamed as the source and cause of HIV spread, even though it was also spread through other routes... “This, in turn, had serious  consequences for the people affected , especially on their mental and emotional wellbeing.” Dr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, an infectious disease physician and virologist at Emory University in Atlanta, drew on parallels with HIV to show the risks of stigmatising monkeypox. She wrote in  PLOS Blogs : ""Cases [of HIV] were under-reported in the early days of the epidemic as individuals who contracted the virus went underground instead of seeking medical care.  ""This resulted in many missed opportunities to quickly learn about the infection, understand its transmission and importantly, provide targeted public health interventions to curb its spread.  ""Instead, individuals in the group most affected at the time were blamed for their own suffering and ostracized as purveyors of disease.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18672586/monkeypox-not-gay-disease-misinformation/,The Sun
"Severe monkeypox patients could be infectious WEEKS after recovery, scientists discover",Vanessa Chalmers,"9:36, 25 May 2022","SEVERE monkeypox patients may be infectious for up to ten weeks, scientists fear. An investigation of previous patients who had  the disease  found one man tested positive more than 70 days after he first showed symptoms. It comes as cases of the virus  reach 71 in the UK , and health officials have urged people to stay alert to symptoms. Signs of the disease  in the early stages include fever, headache, chills, back and muscle aches. A rash  may develop between one and five days later, which at first looks like chickenpox before turning into blisters that scab over. People can catch the virus from others by touching their scabs or lesions, having close physical contact, touching contaminated objects or being exposed to respiratory droplets. Patients are contagious until their scabs fall off, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) says, and the scabs themselves can contain viral material. However, the latest study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggests people may be infectious long after their rash has settled. Researchers looked at seven cases of monkeypox in the UK between 2018 and 2021. One of the patients, an unnamed man in his 40s, caught monkeypox in Nigeria before being hospitalised in the UK.

But six weeks later, when he had sex for the first time since his bout of illness, the tell-tale monkeypox rash returned. The man also had swollen lymph nodes, which are a sign of infection. At hospital, a test that swabs the throat revealed the man was positive for monkeypox.  The findings suggest that the man was infectious, given that he had the rash again. Study author Dr Hugh Adler, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even longer after the rash is resolved.  “We don’t know that this means these patients are more infectious or infectious for longer, but it does inform us of the biology of disease.” It is not clear if the man would have been contagious in the six-week period between hospital discharge, and his “relapse” after having sex. Dr Adler said researchers were “surprised” that monkeypox could be detected in the throat and blood for that length of time, MailOnline reported. A relapse such as this has not been reported before, the paper authors wrote. But they noted they were “unaware of any reports of monkeypox virus detection in seminal fluid”. Other people in the study were positive on respiratory PCR tests for between seven and 17 days. All made a full recovery and none suffered severe complications. The World Health Organization says symptoms of monkeypox usually start from six to 13 days after infection, but can range from five to 40 days. A person is not contagious during this so-called incubation period. They are able to spread the virus once they are showing symptoms, including the rash. Health officials have so far said that patients with monkeypox in the current outbreak have typically had a mild illness.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18679138/severe-monkeypox-patients-infectious-10-weeks/,The Sun
Belgium is first country to introduce monkeypox QUARANTINE as virus spreads across Europe & Brits given holiday warning,Alex Winter,"12:50, 22 May 2022","BELGIUM has become the first country in the world to introduce quarantine for moneypox cases after recording three infections linked to a fetish festival. It comes as  the virus  spreads across Europe and a top British medic warns holidaymakers to ""be alert"" - as children are more likely to become seriously ill. Hours after Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said infections here will rise,  Belgium  announced there will be a mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone suffering from the disease. The country currently has three cases, all of which were recorded on Friday and are linked to the four-day Darklands Festival in port city Antwerp. Organisers said: ""There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries."" The virus can be  significantly more harmful in young children , and it's reported that a British child who has contracted the illness is fighting for their life in intensive care. In an interview on the BBC this morning, Dr Hopkins said: ""We do know from reports from Africa, where the disease has circulated in outbreaks over many years, certain individuals are much more at risk of severe disease, including immuno-suppressed individuals or young children. ""In adults, it is relatively mild."" But she said medics are learning more every day, adding: ""Clearly, this is a  new infectious disease  that we haven't seen in our community before. ""We will need to learn a lot about it over the coming weeks.""

That number is expected  when the figures are updated tomorrow, and Dr Hopkins said: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She was then asked about the risk to Brits attending summer festivals, as well as children on  sunshine holidays. Countries including Spain, Portugal and central Africa are among those reporting outbreaks. On Friday, health chiefs in Spain reported 23 more confirmed cases. Most are linked to a sauna in Madrid. Cases in Spain and Italy have also been  traced to an island festival  attended by 80,000 revellers. ""The risk to the general population remains extremely low,"" she said - but added: ""People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it."" Initial symptoms include a  viral illness , before a chicken pox-type rash spreads across parts of the body. Anyone who feels ill must ""stay at home"", Dr Hopkins said. ""If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic,"" she said. HOLS WARNING It's believed Covid lockdowns across the world may have fuelled the spread of the virus. ""We know there's been period of restrictions across Europe, and we don't know where infection has come from,"" she said. ""There is no obvious connection to a single event in our cases in the UK."" However, medics believe some people are contracting the virus after a sexual encounter as the virus can spread more easily through personal contact. Dr Hopkins says it seems to be particularly prevalent in gay and bi men. Anyone changing sexual partners regularly or having close contact with people they don't know should come forward if they develop a rash, she said. Yesterday, Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, says  the medical community is bracing for more as the virus spreads. We are detecting more cases on a daily basis She told Sky News: ""What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. ""It's already circulating in the general population. ""It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks."" Meanwhile, it has emerged experts warned three years ago that monkeypox would ""fill the void"" left by smallpox. Scientists from leading institutions including the University of Cambridge and the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the disease would evolve to fill the ""niche"" left after smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is usually mild, it can prove fatal in rare cases. The strain causing the current outbreak kills an average of one in 100 infected.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the experts attended a seminar in London back in 2019 and discussed how there was a need to develop ""a new generation vaccines and treatments"". Their discussion was published in the Vaccine journal in 2020. Monkeypox , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact -  including sex . People infected with monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection The NHS says the first symptoms are: They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18648283/monkeypox-travel-warning-holiday-illness/,The Sun
Monkeypox holiday warning as virus spreads across popular tourist spots,Vanessa Chalmers,"15:56, 23 May 2022","BRITS have been warned to be “alert” of monkeypox when they hit popular tourist spots for holiday this year. The  disease  has suddenly started spreading in 20 unlikely places across the world, including Europe. Festivals  - attended by Europeans on holiday - have been tied to outbreaks across the region, including in Spain, Italy and Germany.  The World Health Organization (WHO) said the explosion of cases is “a highly unusual event”. The agency’s Europe director, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could fuel the spread of  monkeypox . Dr Kluge  said : ""I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the  symptoms  are unfamiliar to many."" Asked about the risk to Brits going to summer festivals or going on holiday, chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said people “need to be alert” to the virus. Dr Hopkins, of the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans.

""What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" Before now, there had only been eight cases of  monkeypox in the UK , all with links to travel from West Africa. But that's not the case for this outbreak, which has now seen at least  57 in the UK  infected. There is already community transmission in the UK - but the UKHSA stresses that the risk to the public is ""low"". Many more are expected to be diagnosed in the coming weeks, experts say. The disease appears to be disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men.  Health chiefs have warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, however can be passed on through  skin-to-skin contact during sex . It causes flu-like symptoms before a  blistering rash  spreads across the body. Dr Hopkins comments came as some of Europe’s top holiday destinations reported outbreaks of the virus. There are around 100 cases across Europe and Northern America, the WHO said Monday. The full list of European countries with  monkeypox cases are: And elsewhere in the world: European countries that have  cases And elsewhere in the world: A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox ""mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans. VAX DASH It comes as the EU’s infectious-disease agency prepares to tell member states to prepare vaccination programmes, according to the  Financial Times. Any jab initiatives would use an existing smallpox vaccine that also offers 85 per cent efficacy against monkeypox.  The two virsues cause similar symptoms, although smallpox was eradicated by 1980 thanks to the jabs.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme in the UK. It came despite Health Secretary Sajid Javid ordering a further  20,000 doses  of the smallpox jab on top of the 5,000 already secured.  ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers,"" the PM's spokesperson said. ""But given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign."" The outbreaks are atypical, according to the WHO, as they are occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate.  Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. But as of yet, the WHO does not have evidence the virus has mutated. WHO said confirmed cases have so far been the less severe West African group of monkeypox viruses.  MP Simon Clarke, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said this was not ""some repeat of Covid"". He said: ""We are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18661189/monkeypox-holiday-warning-spreads-popular-tourist-spots/,The Sun
Monkeypox chart reveals the earliest signs of symptoms to watch out for,Vanessa Chalmers,"11:25, 23 May 2022","A SET of images released by public health chiefs reveals the symptoms of monkeypox to look for. People are being urged to be vigilant to the signs of the bug, which is spreading at an unusual rate globally.  There are  20 cases  of  monkeypox  in  the UK , a number that is growing “daily”, according to the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA). Just under 100 cases in 12 countries have been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) between May 13 and 21.  What’s  unusual about these outbreaks  is that they are occurring in places where monkeypox is not endemic. Only eight cases have been reported in the UK over history, but now it is facing a predicted  ""significant rise""  in cases.  The disease usually crops up in the topical and rural rainforests of Central and West Africa. Monkeypox causes symptoms between five and 21 days after exposure. It starts with flu-like  symptoms , including a  fever , headache, muscle and back ache and chills. An itchy and sometimes painful rash slowly appears one to three days into illness, starting with the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

UKHSA says: “Within one to five days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body.” This early phase of the  rash, which they have not provided a photo of, looks like chickenpox, the agency says.  The inside of the mouth, genitals and lining of the eyes can also be affected by the nasty rash. By the third day, lesions have progressed from flat (macular) to raised (papular). And within a couple of days, the lesions become small blisters filled with clear fluid, called vesicles. Vesicles are pictured in the first image of the chart (A). Image B shows how the lesions become round, raised and firm to the touch. These are called pustules, and they contain yellow-coloured pus.  Lesions will develop a depression in the centre (umbilication), pictured in image C. Then, the pustules will remain for approximately five to seven days before beginning to crust (pictured D-F). The UKHSA says: “An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.” Monkeypox lesions can very in size and don’t necessarily develop along the same timeline. While some patients may have only a few lesions, others will have thousands, the WHO says. “In severe cases, lesions can coalesce until large sections of skin slough off,” it says. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18657401/monkeypox-chart-earliest-signs-symptoms-watch-for/,The Sun
"Monkeypox outbreak is ‘unprecedented’ – the five signs you must not ignore, Dr Hilary warns",Vanessa Chalmers,"10:10, 23 May 2022","DR HILARY Jones has warned the outbreak of monkeypox is “unprecedented”, as he told Brits to be vigilant of the symptoms. The UK has 20 cases so far, a number that will be updated on Monday by the UK Health and Security Agency, which says infections are being found “daily”.  Monekypox  primarily occurs in west Africa, but transmission is occurring across Europe, the  US , Canada, Israel, and Australia. The World Health Organization has confirmed 92 cases in 12 countries, with a suspected 28 others.  Good Morning Britain’s Dr Hilary  said 20 cases among a population of 65 million in the UK “doesn’t sound a lot”. “However, it does appear to be an unprecedented outbreak in 11 countries around the world,” he added. “It suggests that it has become a bit more transmissible. “We know it is not a serious infection, usually. Mortality is about one per cent with the less virulent west African variant, if you want to call it a variant. “We need to be vigilant. People need to know  the symptoms  of flu-like symptoms and  a rash ."" Dr Hilary  warned to look out for: Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence The  monkeypox  rash appears one to three days after the flu-like symptoms kick in. It often starts on the face before spreading to others parts of the body, including the genital area. The illness typically lasts between  two and four weeks . Dr Hilary said people should self-isolate if they have been in contact with someone who has monkeypox, as they are a high-risk person and could spread it themselves. He said: “Self isolation means not travelling, it means giving details so that contact tracing can occur. “And we are adding supplies of smallpox vaccines to protect people who are at high risk, people who work in health services for example.  “So for most people, no great concern at the moment but I think watch this space, we need to be vigilant.” The symptoms of monkeypox are similar to, but milder, than smallpox - a deadly disease now eradicated. The smallpox vaccine is also around 85 per cent effective at preventing the monkeypox bug because they come from the same family of viruses. NOT A REPEAT OF COVID, BUT CONCERNING  Dr Hilary’s reassuring message came as a UK Government minister said monkeypox is not a “repeat of” Covid-19. Chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News: ""I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. ""There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact.” Britain has around  5,000 smallpox jabs , with orders for another 20,000.  Mr Clarke said he was not aware of reports in the  Sunday Telegraph  of a baby being in intensive care with monkeypox. He said: ""What I would say is we are cautious but we are certainly not in a position where I would in any way worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness."" Official Government guidance now recommends high-risk contacts to  self-isolate for 21 days. The advice applies to anyone who has had  sexual  or household contact with a patient showing symptoms. The virus can be passed on if someone sleeps in, or changes the sheets, of another who is infected.  However, the virus does not usually spread easily between people.  High risk contacts should also stay away from vulnerable people - those with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and children under 12 years old.  The virus can be significantly more harmful in young children. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said “a notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men”. She said: “We are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned.” Dr Hopkins told BBC One’s Sunday Morning that ""more cases are being detected on a daily basis"". She added: ""We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we’ve seen previously in this country.” Dr Charlotte Hammer, Everitt Butterfield Fellow in Emerging Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge, said: “The increasing case numbers in the current monkeypox outbreak are certainly concerning.  “It is very unusual to see community transmission in Europe, previous monkeypox cases have been in returning travellers with limited ongoing spread. “However, based on the number of cases that were already discovered across Europe and the UK in the previous days, it is not unexpected that additional cases are now being and will be found, especially with the contact tracing that is now happening.” Dr Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, said the escalating outbreak is “undoubtedly worrying”. “The extent of the community transmission of monkeypox, being observed here in the UK and now in several other countries around the world, is concerning,” he said.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18656195/monkeypox-outbreak-unprecedented-dr-hilary-jones-symptoms/,The Sun

Medics have said the risk to the general population is low - but Brits have been urged to be  on the look out  for any new  rashes or blisters . The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is currently contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases. Those who have been assessed and remain well have been asked to isolate for 21 days in order to avoid the bug spreading. Of the 190 cases, four have been confirmed in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: ""The risk to the general public from monkeypox is still low, but it’s important that we work to limit the virus being passed on.  ""We remind people that they should be alert to new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body.  ""If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person."" The experts say that while this advise applies to everyone, the majority of infections have been found in men who are gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men.

Monkeypox  is a mild illness which gets better with time, in very rare cases it can lead to death. It's most prevalent in parts of west or central Africa, but cases have now been detected globally. With that in mind, and with cases continuing to rise, Brits have been urged to be vigilant during Jubilee celebrations this weekend. Millions of people across the country will be taking part in celebrating  70 years of service  of our current monarch. Events  such as street parties, pub gatherings and barbeques are set to take place. Consultant in Health Protection at UKHSA South West Dr Charlotte Bigland said: ""Monkeypox is circulating nationally and internationally, so it’s important to for people to stay vigilant. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages. At first it can look like chickenpox, before bumps become raised and filled with pus. These lesions finally form a scab, which later falls off. ""There has been a notable number of cases identified among people who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these groups in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner. “Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should contact 111 or their local sexual health service for advice. ""If you think you might have Monkeypox, please phone ahead before attending a healthcare setting in person so we can ensure a good clinical experience."" Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"" and are like a viral illness, medics say. A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to the genital areas.

UK confirms 36 NEW cases of monkeypox – as health chiefs urge ‘be alert to symptoms’,Vanessa Chalmers,"16:58, 23 May 2022","A FURTHER 36 cases of monkeypox cases have been detected in England, taking the country’s total to 56. One case of the virus has also been reported by Scotland today. The  monkeypox  outbreak, now spanning some 20 countries, is mystifying health leaders. It is endemic in West and Central Africa, but extremely  rare elsewhere .  However, between 100 and 200 confirmed and suspected cases have been dected in recent weeks across the world. The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said whilst the current outbreak is “significant and concerning”, the risk to the UK population remains low. But people should be alert to the symptoms of the disease, which includes a flu-like illness before a  blistering rash , which starts on the face, hands and feet. A notable number of cases are among men who are gay and bisexual, which is being closely investigated. Monkeypox is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, it can be spread through sexual contact when someone touches the lesions of an infected person.

Coughs and sneezes are also a mode of transmission. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, UKHSA, said: “Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK.  “Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms.   “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.” Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  said monkeypox is a rare disease but it is important to ""keep an eye on it"". He told reporters on a visit to a school in south-east London: ""It's basically a very rare disease and so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious. ""But it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the the new UK Health Security Agency is doing."" The Government has  stocks of a vacccine for smallpox  - an eradicated virus of the same family - which is around 85 per cent effective against monkeypox. It is being offered to very close contacts of those who are symptomatic in order to prevent further spread. Although monkeypox has been known for 40 years, the World Health Organization(WHO) noted why this explosion of cases was different. It is the first time there had been several cases without links to travel to the 11 endemic nations in Africa. And it is unusual there are so many cases across many countries simultaneously. The WHO's emerging disease lead Maria Van Kerkhove said the situation was ""containable"".  Meanwhile, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) director, Andrea Ammon, said most of the cases had mild symptoms. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" Ammon added in a statement. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include: A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals.

How many monkeypox cases are there in the UK?,Jacob Bentley-York,"10:50, 23 May 2022","CASES of monkeypox are continuing to rise in the UK with infections being found “daily,” according to experts. The UK Health Security Agency has since updated  guidance for self-isolation  as authorities look to combat the “unprecedented” outbreak. How many monkeypox cases are there in the UK? The UK has so far confirmed 20  monkeypox  cases – with more expected to be announced later today (Monday, May 23, 2022). More than 80 cases have also been  identified across Europe , the US, Canada, Israel and Australia. The disease , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact -  including sex . The UK Health Security Agency has said a notable proportion of cases in Britain and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men. At present, health chiefs are urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. Anyone with unusual skin lesions should seek attention quickly, doctors advise. What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is a usually mild infection, with symptoms including fever, headaches and a distinctive bumpy rash.  The rash often begins on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals.

If infected, the NHS says you will usually need to stay in a specialised hospital so the infection doesn't spread and your  symptoms can be treated. However, the infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Where did monkeypox come from? Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. But outbreaks in Britain, Portugal, Spain and the United States, have triggered alarm among public health experts. According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ), the name monkeypox originates from the initial discovery of the virus in monkeys in a Danish laboratory in 1958. The first human case was identified in a child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. Is monkeypox deadly? The WHO says the monkeypox virus is similar to  human smallpox  and while it is much milder, it can be fatal. However, they stress that “there have been no deaths associated with this outbreak”. Is there a vaccine for monkeypox? In Britain,  authorities are offering a monkeypox vaccine  to healthcare workers and others who may have been exposed. The UK is said to have around 5,000 jabs – which are also around 85 per cent effective at preventing the new bug. And while experts have said the overall risk remains low,  Sajid Javid  has ordered the UKHSA to take a belt and braces approach and secure a further 20,000 doses. It came as another UK Government minister said monkeypox is not a “repeat of”  Covid-19  given the availability of vaccinations. A Whitehall source said: ""Sajid directed procurement of the relevant vaccine months ago as a precautionary measure but we are making sure we are further ahead of the curve by taking decisive action to secure even more of the vaccine. ""We aren’t too worried at this point but will be keeping a very close eye on the situation. It’s better to be safe than sorry.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18657044/how-many-monkeypox-cases-uk/,The Sun
China labs cash in on monkeypox outbreak with test kits & ‘vaccine’ that could be ready in year as global cases hit 200,Adrian Zorzut,"15:51, 25 May 2022","CHINESE labs are cashing in on the recent monkeypox outbreak by selling test kits and a 'vaccine' as global cases hit 200. The country's state-run media claimed that ""several"" manufacturers have  already produced a nucleic acid test kit  ""which can be quickly into mass production"" and on the shelves within weeks. Global Times, a mouthpiece for the  Chinese  government, also claimed scientists could develop a vaccine for  monkeypox  by the end of the year. ""Several Chinese test kit makers reached by the Global Times on Monday said they have developed nucleic acid test kits for monkeypox, which can be quickly put into mass production and on the domestic market once approved by the government,"" the paper said. ""Meanwhile, experts pointed out that there are no technological problems in developing a vaccine against monkeypox and a rapid special review by China's drug administration could help the country develop the vaccine in roughly a year."" Pharmaceutical company Sinovac saw sales in the first half of 2021 explode to more than 160 times the previous year thanks to the development of a Covid vaccine. The firm raked in £9billion in the first six months of last year, up from just £50million in 2020, showing the huge gains that can be made during a pandemic. Some 221 monkeypox cases have been confirmed worldwide since  the first patient was registered to have the rare virus in the UK  on May 6. The  United Arab Emirates ,  Czech Republic  and  Slovenia  are the latest countries to register casess. Meanwhile, the Imvanex jab developed by Danish-based Bavarian Nordic is said to be 85 percent affective against monkeypox and Covid.

Nineteen countries have detected cases in the past month, which has sparked alarm because infections usually only occur in west and central Africa but  has now spread to Europe and the Americas . Before now, there had only been eight cases of  monkeypox in the UK , all with links to travel from West Africa. But that's not the case for this outbreak, which has now seen at least  57 in the UK  infected. There is already community transmission in the UK - but the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) stresses that the risk to the public is ""low"". Many more are expected to be diagnosed in the coming weeks, experts say. The disease appears to be  disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men . Health chiefs have warned gay and bisexual men to be on the lookout for  new unexplained rashes . Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, however can be passed on through  skin-to-skin contact during sex . It causes flu-like symptoms before a  blistering rash  spreads across the body. And  Brits have been warned to be ""alert"" of monkeypox  when they hit popular tourist spots for holiday this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the explosion of cases is “a highly unusual event”. The agency’s Europe director, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could fuel the spread of  monkeypox . Dr Kluge  said : ""I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity, and the  symptoms  are unfamiliar to many."" Asked about the risk to Brits going to summer festivals or going on holiday, chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said people “need to be alert” to the virus. Dr Hopkins, of UKHSA, told the BBC: “The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low. “People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.” A leading adviser to the WHO said the “random” outbreak of monkeypox might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe. A Gay Pride festival in Gran Canaria - attended by 80,000 people - was linked with a number of cases in Madrid, Tenerife and Italy. In Spain, which has the most monkeypox cases in Europe, infections in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid were traced back to a sauna - Sauna Paraíso - which has since been closed. A number of other communities followed reporting more cases, including Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Extremadura. A German government report to lawmakers, obtained by the AP, said the risk of catching monkeypox ""mainly appears to lie with sexual contacts among men”. The four confirmed cases in Germany have been linked to exposure at party events including on Gran Canaria and in Berlin, it said.  Meanwhile,  Belgium's  three confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, it was revealed on Friday.  Dr David Heymann, who formerly headed WHOs emergencies department, said the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission among gay and bisexual men at two raves held in Spain and Belgium.  Dr Heymann told AP that it’s known monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. It looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission, Dr Heymann said. Monkeypox typically infects people in Central and Western Africa when it jumps from a wild animal, such as rodents and primates, into humans.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18684026/china-labs-monkeypox-outbreak-tests-kits-vaccine/,The Sun
UK says monkeypox close contacts should ISOLATE for 21 days with kids among most at risk as more cases to be confirmed,Jon Rogers,"21:43, 22 May 2022","BRITS who have had close contact with monkeypox patients should self-isolate for 21 days, the government now says - as more cases are set to be announced on Monday. The updated guidance from the UK Health Security Agency also warns those at risk of  monkeypox  infection to stay away from vulnerable people. That includes pregnant women, kids under 12 and people with suppressed immunity.  High risk contacts include people sharing a house, sexual partners or even someone changing an infected person’s bedding without wearing the appropriate PPE. They should also be offered a vaccine, the UKHSA said. The guidance - which is not a legal requirement - comes after Belgium became the first country to introduce  mandatory 21-day quarantine  for monkeypox patients. As the outbreak explodes across Europe, doctors are warning new infections of the disease are being detected on a daily basis and  will rise significantly . On Friday the total number of confirmed cases in the UK  more than doubled to 20  and that is expected to rise again when the latest figures are released on Monday. One of the cases in the UK is thought to be a child who is currently in a critical condition in a  London  hospital. The cause of the outbreak in Britain is not yet known as there is “no obvious connection” between those infected to a single event, according to the UKHSA’s Dr Susan Hopkins.

Dr Hopkins says it seems to be particularly prevalent in gay and bisexual men. Anyone changing sexual partners regularly or having close contact with people they don't know should come forward if they develop a rash - one of they  key symptoms  - she said. In Spain - which has more than 50 known cases - authorities have linked some to a sauna in Madrid. Other cases in Spain and Italy are linked to  a festival  attended by crowds of 80,000 in Gran Canaria. Meanwhile, US President  Joe Biden  has said the outbreak is “a concern”. And  Austria 's first case of monkeypox was confirmed on Sunday, Vienna's health authority said. Israel  also recorded its first case this weekend. Belgium  currently has three cases, all of which were recorded on Friday and are linked to the four-day Darklands Festival in port city Antwerp. Dr Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, was asked about the risk to Brits attending summer festivals, as well as children on  sunshine holidays. She said the illness is ""relatively mild"" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. ""The risk to the general population remains extremely low,"" she said. But she added: ""People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it."" 'STAY AT HOME' Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"", Dr Hopkins said, and are like ""a viral illness"". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. ""It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,"" Dr Hopkins said. ""They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious. ""If you have a rash, immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic."" Anyone who feels ill must ""stay at home"", Dr Hopkins said. People infected with monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection The NHS says the first symptoms are: They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. Yesterday, Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said  the medical community is bracing for more as the virus spreads. She told Sky News: ""What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. ""It's already circulating in the general population. ""It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks."" Meanwhile, it has emerged experts warned three years ago that monkeypox would ""fill the void"" left by smallpox. Scientists from leading institutions including the University of Cambridge and the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the disease would evolve to fill the ""niche"" left after smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is usually mild, it can prove fatal in rare cases. The strain causing the current outbreak kills an average of one in 100 infected.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the experts attended a seminar in London back in 2019 and discussed how there was a need to develop ""a new generation vaccines and treatments"". Their discussion was published in the Vaccine journal in 2020. Monkeypox , which was first found in monkeys, can be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact - including sex.

"Monkeypox ‘may be too late to contain and will be hard to stamp out’, say experts",Vanessa Chalmers,"11:56, 3 Jun 2022","MONKEYPOX in the UK will “be hard to stamp out”, an expert has said, as the World Health Organization says it could be “too late”. There have been  190 cases  of  monkeypox  detected in the UK so far, health chiefs say, and 550 worldwide. Professor John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said  the outbreak  will likely last a number of months. Health officials will be using contact tracing to find more cases of the virus and try to contain it. But Prof Edmunds, a leading epidemiologist and scientific adviser to the Government, said it will be a “lot of work” - but ultimately it is controllable. Prof Edmunds said the fact that so many infections have been “cropping up all over the world” indicated there was “going to be a problem”. “You’re not going to get rid of it overnight,” he told  The Independent. “It’s going to take a good couple of months of really solid work to chase up all the infections and contacts and stamp it out. “It will take a while. Public health teams are chasing all of these chains of transmission — some of them are going to be cryptic for all kinds of reasons. “And the incubation period [the time between infection and symptoms] is quite long — nine or 10 days, possibly even longer. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence “So chains of transmission are slow, which is good. It gives you time to contact trace. On the other hand, if you’re missing some cases, then it’s going to bubble along for a while.” The World Health Organization (WHO) said the number of cases seen so far could be  the “tip of the iceberg”. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the sudden appearance of monkeypox in unlikely countries suggests the virus has been spreading undetected for some time. While it is endemic in West and Central African nations - with 9,000 cases a year - its emergence elsewhere has been unexpected. Dr Rosamund Lewis, the WHO’s monkeypox technical lead, said at a press conference on Wednesday: “We don’t really know whether it’s too late to contain. “What WHO and all member states are trying to do is prevent onward spread.” So far, there have been 190 confirmed cases of monkeypox identified from 6th to 31st May in the UK. Monkeypox appears to be spreading from person to person in England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Wednesday. ""The current outbreak is the first time that the virus has been passed from person to person in England where travel links to an endemic country have not been identified,"" the agency said. According to the UKHSA, the majority of cases in the UK - 132 - are in London. And 111 cases are known to be in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Only two cases are in women. Monkeypox can affect anyone, but many of the most recent diagnoses are the GBMSM community. Many of them live in, or have links to London, said Kevin Fenton, London's regional director for public health. ""As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great,"" he said. Recent foreign travel to a number of different countries in Europe has been reported by 34 confirmed cases, or about 18 per cent. . So far, the UKHSA has identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in Britain and abroad. ""Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified,"" the agency cautioned. Monkeypox typically causes  flu-like symptoms  and pus-filled skin  lesions  that usually resolve on their own within weeks, but can kill a small fraction of those infected.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18771481/monkeypox-too-late-contain-hard-stamp-out/,The Sun
Warning to parents to watch for monkeypox symptoms as child ends up in intensive care,Terri-Ann Williams,"10:33, 23 May 2022","A CHILD in the UK has contracted monkeypox as the outbreak continues to spread. Around 20 people in the country have tested positive for the illness, with one of these being a child in  London . It's not known how old the youngster is, but they are currently in a critical condition in hospital. Monkyepox  is a rare disease, with most cases found in Africa. But over the last week the virus has been detected  across the globe . Later today the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are set to announce even more cases. It's important that you know the  signs to look out for , especially in little ones, who might not be able to explain how they are feeling. Dr Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said the illness is ""relatively mild"" in adults, with young children thought to be more at risk. Initial symptoms  are usually ""non-specific"", Dr Hopkins said, and are like ""a viral illness"". A chickenpox-type  rash  later spreads across parts of the body. Mum-of-8 dies after spending years inside hiding her face due to rare disease I put my tiredness down to partying but the reality was devastating I'm a dietician - here's the 4 worst breakfast mistakes for blood sugar levels I was given cough syrup to treat a bug - now I'm facing a death sentence The rash  usually affects the face, hands and arms, but can spread to genital areas. ""It starts as red spots and moves to vesicles - those are blister-type lesions that are a bit like chickenpox,"" Dr Hopkins said. ""They scab over and once the scabs have fallen off, they're no longer infectious."" Medics  say the fatality rate in children is between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. People who have contracted monkeypox will usually start to experience symptoms five to 21 days after initial infection. Most of the time, children will experience the same symptoms as adults. If you think your little one is unwell then you should always seek medical attention. They added that a rash usually appears one to five days after the symptoms. It's important that  parents  also look out for signs that their child is feeling generally unwell. If your child is exhausted they might become irritable and not enjoy the things they usually do. When it comes to taking their temperature, experts have previously warned you should not rely on a t hermometer's traffic light system  for your children. This is because what would be deemed as a concerning temperature for babies, is different from what is concerning for an adult. The  NHS  says a normal temperature in babies and children is about 36.4C, but this can vary slightly from child to child. If they have a high temperature, this will be around 38C or more.
