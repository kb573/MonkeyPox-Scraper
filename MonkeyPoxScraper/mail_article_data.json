{"title": "UK's monkeypox outbreak passes 1,000 cases: Milestone reached as virus continues to spread among gay and bi men — but gloomy model warns of 60,000 cases a DAY by Christmas", "author": "Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 15:57, 28 June 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  cases in the UK have risen above 1,000 as the rare disease continues to spread, officials confirmed today. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said there had been 1,076 infections as of Sunday, almost double the number a fortnight ago. Authorities said they expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and are advising anyone going to large events or having sex with new partners to 'be alert' for symptoms. Cases continue to be predominantly among gay and bisexual men and the UK's outbreak has been linked to raves, saunas and dating apps, with the virus mostly spreading through sex.  It came as modelling by a Strathclyde University professor warned the outbreak could continue for another year and infect tens of thousands of Britons daily in a worst-case scenario. The simulation assumes all under-50s — the last age group to get a smallpox vaccine, which provides cross-protection —  are susceptible to monkeypox. Other scientists do not expect the virus to ever reach the heights of Covid waves because monkeypox requires prolonged close contact or contaminated surfaces to spread. Announcing Britain's new cases today, Dr Sophia Makki, incident director at the UKHSA, said: 'The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.  'We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks. If you are attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.

Under one 'very pessimistic scenario', infections peak at 60,000, the total number of people infected nears 20million and the epidemic lasts for more than one year. 'The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities,' Professor Kleczkowski said. ENDEMIC: Under separate modelling, Professor Kleczkowski said that due to monkeypox's low transmissibility and long incubation period — which allows it to survive at low levels in the population — it is possible that the virus has already been spreading in the UK 'for a long time'. Following the current spike in infections, the disease may 'settle on a long-term, relatively constant level' similar to how smallpox and chickenpox spread before vaccines were rolled out. Under this model, 'mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease', he said RECURRENT LARGE EPIDEMICS: In a separate model from Professor Kleczkowski, the current outbreak could be 'the first instance of a serious of outbreaks' fuelled by zoonotic transmission — when the disease jumps from an animal to a human — and cause sporadic surges of infection in the future. 'As the cross-immunity from smallpox vaccines wanes, the epidemics can become even more substantial,' he said. While little is known about monkeypox's potential to mutate, there is room for it to 'evolve into a more rapidly spreading variant', Professor Kleczkowski said SELF-LIMITING OUTBREAK: However, in his least severe set of calculations, he suggested that the outbreak took off due to a super-spreader event involving a network of men who have sex with men. In this scenario, the outbreak 'ends quickly' once the population at risk becomes immune and heard immunity is reached locally Previous 1 Next                                     : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. : A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   'Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk. 'If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.' Dozens of countries have logged cases of monkeypox, which is usually only spotted in Africa and has until now fizzled out after a handful of cases in other parts of the world.  Almost all infections so far have been spotted in men who have sex with men abroad, as well. Professor Adam Kleczkowski, a mathematician at the University of Strathclyde, warned Britain's infections could keep rising until the end of year — when a peak of 60,000 people could be catching the virus every day. 'Unless a combination of contact tracing and ring vaccination stops the spread, the monkeypox will continue spreading,' Professor Kleczkowski said.  To calculate how the monkeypox outbreak could continue to spread in the UK, Professor Kleczkowski estimated that each infected person would go on to infect two more people — known as the R rate. He said 53 per cent of a population would need to be infected for enough people to have immunity to stop the virus spreading — known as herd immunity. And the incubation period — the length of time from catching the virus to when symptoms start — was five to 21 days. Based on these parameters, he modelled how the outbreak would unfold if all males aged 50 and under are susceptible to the virus. This equates to 40 per cent of the UK's population — around 26.8million people — and is classified as a 'large population at risk'. He said the parameters are based on the over-50s likely having some immunity from smallpox vaccinations, which the UK stopped rolling out in 1971, and the spread so far mainly occurring among men.  Anyone can catch the virus, which is spread by close contact with an infected person.  But most cases in the ongoing surge are among the 'sexual networks' of men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection. But sex is thought to be the main mode of transmission in the ongoing outbreak. The virus, first discovered in lab monkeys in the 1950s, can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone who is infected.  Under the 'very pessimistic scenario', infections peak at 60,000, the total number of people infected nears 20million and the epidemic lasts for more than one year.  'The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities,' Professor Kleczkowski said. However, he noted that he does not have a 'working model' of the outbreak but aimed to produce 'believable scenarios of what could happen in the near future'. The calculations are based on modelling up to June 17 and are 'likely to change' as new data emerges, he said. And since his modelling on June 17, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed some gay and bisexual men will be offered the smallpox Imvanex vaccine — which is 85 per cent effective against monkeypox — to control the outbreak. Under the plans, which come from the same experts who advised on the Covid vaccine rollout, medics will offer the jab to men who have multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues. Until the move was announced last week, the jab was only offered to confirmed cases and their close contacts under a strategy called ring vaccination, which has been proven to work in other outbreaks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: 'By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak.' Under separate modelling, Professor Kleczkowski said that due to monkeypox's low transmissibility and long incubation period — which allows it to survive at low levels in the population — it is possible that the virus has already been spreading in the UK 'for a long time'. Following the current spike in infections, the disease may 'settle on a long-term, relatively constant level' similar to how smallpox spread before vaccines were rolled out. Under this model, 'mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease', he said.  A third model from Professor Kleczkowski sets out that the current outbreak could be 'the first instance of a series of outbreaks' fuelled by zoonotic transmission — when the disease jumps from an animal to a human — and cause sporadic surges of infection in the future. 'As the cross-immunity from smallpox vaccines wanes, the epidemics can become even more substantial,' he said. While little is known about monkeypox's potential to mutate, there is room for it to 'evolve into a more rapidly spreading variant', Professor Kleczkowski said.  However, in a fouth model — his least severe set of calculations — the outbreak 'ends quickly' once the population at risk becomes immune and herd immunity is reached locally. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious It comes as US health chiefs yesterday announced that monkeypox has mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. A team from the NIH studied 15 samples of the virus from the current outbreak. They restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. The researchers could not determine why the virus is changing faster than expected. But they believe that the finding could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year, which has seen 201 cases in the US. Meanwhile, the UKHSA last week set out a strategy for some gay and bisexual men at 'higher risk' of exposure to monkeypox to be offered a vaccine to control the outbreak. Officials have not put a number on how many men will be included in the rollout. Under the plans, endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), those eligible for  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — a pill that protects against HIV — will also be eligible for the vaccine. This includes people who do not always use condoms during sex and are likely to continue not using them, as well as sex workers or their clients who report having unprotected sex. NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted. As well as gay and bisexual men, the list of NHS staff eligible for the jab is also being expanded. Healthcare workers caring for monkeypox patients in specialist high consequence infectious disease (HICD) wards are already offered the jab. But now staff in other hospitals designed to care for monkeypox patients will also be offered the jab, as well as workers in laboratories that test for the virus. The UKHSA is urging all Britons to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have had close contact with a new partner. Those with symptoms are told to avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre.  ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10961075/UKs-monkeypox-outbreak-passes-1-000-cases-gloomy-model-warns-doomsday-scenario.html"},
{"title": "US allowed monkeypox vaccine stockpile to dwindle 99.99% from 20million to 2,400 doses because officials only 'planned for smallpox' and were working on shot with a longer shelf-life: California and Illinois declare state of emergency", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 17:32, 2 August 2022 ", "text": "The United States allowed its  monkeypox  vaccine stockpile to dwindle from 20million to just 2,400 doses because it had only planned for a smallpox outbreak and was working on alternatives, it was revealed today — as  California  and  Illinois  declared a state of emergency over the virus. Official documents showed how the 'strategic' stockpile was allowed to plummet to 0.012 percent from its peak in 2013, as doses of the Jynneos vaccine — which only have a three-year shelf life — ran out. An attempt was made to restock it in 2015 when another 8million doses were ordered. Once these were expired, America signed for another 1.3million — but mostly these were still in Denmark when monkeypox struck because the Food and Drug Administration still hadn't inspected their manufacturing facility. Thousands of gay or bisexual men have been left waiting weeks to get doses, with many left with no option but to spend hours sitting at home hitting refresh on their browsers in the hopes of securing a coveted appointment. States have also complained they are getting too few doses from the national stockpile. The revelation published by the  New York Times  came as America's cases tally hit 5,800, with a further 622 infections detected this weekend. There have been no deaths to date, but four have been detected outside Africa including two in Spain which has a similar-sized outbreak. California and Illinois — which have the second and third highest case counts — both said they would declare a state of emergency over monkeypox today. They join New York City and San Francisco in hitting the panic button over the outbreak, although federal officials are yet to make a similar move. America once had 20million doses of Jynneos vaccine - the preferred option for fighting monkeypox - in its national stockpile. But these jabs, with a shelf-life of three years, quickly expired. It has moved to replenish stocks since then, but bought less as the strategy shifted to developing a longer-lived jab The above map shows where in the U.S. monkeypox cases have been detected. New York has the largest outbreak and is the only state to confirm more than 1,000 cases Pictured above are men waiting in line for the monkeypox vaccine in Encino, California. It came after the state's governor declared a state of emergency in the area Pictured above are men standing in long lines to get doses of the monkeypox vaccine in San Francisco in early July. The city was the first place to declare monkeypox an emergency America's national stockpile of these jabs was ramped up after the 9/11 attacks over fears terrorist groups could get hold of and re-release the smallpox virus, which is currently eradicated. The Jynneous doses were only ever meant to be offered to vulnerable people in this case, such as young children and older adults. Millions of doses of other jabs like ACAM2000 and Dryvax were held for the general population, but these are generally not preferred because of the risk of side-effects. As the Bavarian Nordic-made jabs expired, however, federal officials decided to invest in developing new 'freeze-dried' jabs that could last for up to ten years — or three-times longer than current stocks.  Previous 1 Next                   : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like virus occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the virus is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the virus at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 5,000 cases nationwide. : Monkeypox cases are detected in children and a pregnant woman in the U.S., in a sign it is spreading to other groups. They have invested more than $1billion in this to date, but the longer-lived jabs are still yet to be developed. Amid dwindling supplies, the Federal Government also switched to buying the vaccine in bulk — or as a fluid stored in plastic bags. This is stored in Denmark and could not immediately be rolled out because it still needed to be filled-and-finished, or put into vials to be distributed to the population. An order of 1.3million more Jynneos doses was placed in 2020 to augment the national stockpile records showed.  Of these, 372,000 doses had been filled and finished by an FDA-approved contractor meaning they could quickly be shipped to the U.S. for use. But the rest — nearly a million jabs — went through this process at the company's new factory which was yet to get the rubber-stamp from the FDA. It meant that when monkeypox struck they were held up in Denmark while officials carried out the inspection. Federal  officials revealed that when monkeypox first struck they had just 2,400 Jynneos doses available. Dr Gary Disbrow, who directed the agency that supported the development of Jynneos and other jabs, told the NYT that with the national stockpile: 'Our planning was for smallpox.' 'We have to prepare against multiple threats with a limited budget.' Monkeypox — which had been known since the early 1950s from Africa — had not entered high on their list of threats because it generally did not circulate beyond the continent. All the vaccines being used were designed to fight smallpox, but officials say they can also be used against monkeypox because the two viruses are closely related. It was revealed as the governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency over the monkeypox outbreak, joining New York and San Francisco. Both states have seen cases escalate in recent weeks, with California now having the second-biggest outbreak in the country and Illinois the third largest. They have declared the emergencies to make more resources available to combat the virus, and ramp up the number of people that can dish out the jabs. Declaring the emergency in California, Governor Gavin Newsom said the state was 'working urgently... to slow the spread of monkeypox.' He added they were leveraging testing and contact tracing knowledge from the pandemic to fight the virus. Local LGBT group Equality California applauded the move, saying in a statement that the virus 'continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men'.  Pictured above are vials of the monkeypox and smallpox vaccine in Chicago, Illinois, after the state today declared an emergency over the outbreak of the virus In Illinois, Governor JB Pritzker said: 'I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and co-ordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating and preventing the spread of monkeypox. 'In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBT community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.' It is understood that the federal government is also considering declaring monkeypox an emergency, but is yet to take the step. It was reported this could be as soon as last week.  California has received 61,000 doses of the vaccine to date, and in some areas is aiming to roll them out to everyone who requests one. Los Angeles is receiving a separate vaccine allocation. This tally is far below the 600,000 to 800,000 jabs that have been requested. The health department says it is 'hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state's request'. To date more than 336,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine have been dished out to states from the national stockpile. A further almost 800,000 doses have also been delivered to the country, and are now being allocated to different states and cities. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11073415/US-allowed-monkeypox-vaccine-stockpile-dwindle-99-99-20million-2-400-doses.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox cases in UK rise by 159 to 1,235 as health officials issue warning ahead of Pride weekend urging people not to attend if they have symptoms or feel unwell", "author": "Elizabeth Haigh For Mailonline", "date": " 09:45, 2 July 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  cases in the UK continue to rise ahead of the  London  Pride parade later today, now reaching 1,235 confirmed cases. Officials have now released a warning urging anyone who thinks they might have monkeypox to stay away from the parade to avoid further spread. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the number of cases jumped by a further 159 by June 30, up from 1,076 on June 28.  Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: 'The monkeypox outbreak continues to grow.  Pride events began yesterday, July 1, and will culminate in a hue parade through central London later today Examples of the monkeypox rash, which can appear anywhere on the body and often spreads to the genital area 'Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.  'This weekend, let’s enjoy Pride safely – before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes.  'Please don’t attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell. If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested.  'Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks – especially if you are having sex with someone new.  'To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners, to help us limit further transmission where cases occur.' Meanwhile top public-health doctor Professor Kevin Fenton has also urged anyone with suspected symptoms to stay at home and contact the NHS for advice. It was time for clear messages, Prof Fenton told  BBC News . \"If you think you may have monkeypox - blisters, fevers, swollen glands - please do not go out over the weekend,\" he said. \"Stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.\" Professor Fenton expects a further rise in cases in coming weeks as it can take time for symptoms to appear. London Mayor Sadiq Khan echoed calls for anyone with possible symptoms to stay at home. But he added it was essential the parade goes ahead as planned after the recent shooting at Oslo's pride event in June.  The UKHSA says it has been advising and working with organisers of mass events throughout the outbreak, which has emerged in the last couple of months. Gay and bisexual men have been 'disproportionately affected' health officials have said. Monkeypox is spreading across the world as well as in the UK - with African countries appealing for help as the outbreak across the west is reflected in a rise in cases for them too Although there is no clear evidence as to why the majority of cases have been identified in members of the LGBT+ community, it is thought this may be to do with the fact gay and bisexual men tend to have more awareness of, and get checked more regularly for, sexually transmitted diseases. This means they are more likely to notice changes such as rashes and blisters. Until this year monkeypox had not seen a widespread global outbreak, instead being limited mainly to parts of Africa.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. MAY 7, 2022: A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. MAY 14, 2022: Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. MAY 16, 2022: Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The spate of cases was described as 'unusual' and 'surprising' as experts warn gay and bisexual men to look out for new rashes. MAY 19, 2022: Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. MAY 20, 2022: Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them MAY 23, 2022: Scotland logs its first ever monkeypox case and 36 more infection announced in England. It brings the UK total to 57. MAY 24, 2022: England logs another 14 cases, bringing the UK total to 71. MAY 25, 2022: Another seven infections are spotted in England, meaning 78 cases have been detected in the UK. MAY 26, 2022: Wales and Northern Ireland detect their first monkeypox case in the recent outbreak, while Scotland spots two more cases and England logs eight, bringing UK total to 90. MAY 27, 2022: England detects 16 more cases, meaning 106 people in Britain have confirmed infections. MAY 29, 2022: World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. MAY 30, 2022: The UK detects another 71 monkeypox cases, bringing the UK total to 179. Cases jumped 70 per cent in just three days. MAY 31, 2022: Eleven infections are spotted across the UK, bringing the infection toll to 190. JUNE 1, 2022: Another five cases are spotted in England and one is detected in Scotland, meaning the UK has now logged 196. JUNE 2, 2022: The UK spots another 11 cases in England, bringing the UK total to 207. JUNE 3, 2022: A further 18 cases are logged - 15 in England and three in Scotland, bringing Britain's monkeypox infection toll to 225. JUNE 6, 2022: Seventy-three cases are spotted in England, 2 in Scotland and 2 in Wales, bringing the UK total to 302. JUNE 8, 2022: Some 18 people in England and one in Scotland test positive, meaning 321 people have had infections confirmed. JUNE 10, 2022: Forty-three more cases are spotted in England and one in each in Scotland and Wales. The UK has now confirmed 366 infections. JUNE 13, 2022: Another 103 cases are spotted in England, bringing UK total to 470. JUNE 15, 2022: Another 52 cases are identified in England, and one each in Wales and Scotland, bringing the total infections to 524. JUNE 15, 2022: A further 50 cases are identified in the UK, bringing the total infections to 574.  JUNE 21, 2022: The UKHSA changes how often infection rates are reported. The current UK total is 793 confirmed cases, with 766 of those in England JUNE 24, 2022: Another 107 cases are reported, bringing the total to 873. JUNE 28, 2022: The UKHSA announced another 166 monkeypox cases, taking the total over 1,000 to 1,076. JULY 1, 2022: The day before the London Pride parade it is announced there are 1,235 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK. Attendees are advised to check themselves for any unusual rashes or symptoms before travelling to Pride. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. According to the UKHSA, monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people and the overall risk to the UK population remains low. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash then tends to blister and scab over before eventually drying and falling off.  Of the 1,235 cases, the UKHSA has confirmed that 77 per cent of those affected who have a registered address are residents of London. Of the 1,185 cases where gender data is available, 1,180 cases appeared in men with just five in women. The median age of infection in the UK so far is 37. London alone now has had 692 confirmed cases, with a further 287 cases where the location has not yet been determined. There are fears that the London Pride parade, which takes place today, could lead to further spread due to the close proximity of people. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to descend on the capital to celebrate. The event will mark the 50th anniversary of the first ever Pride parade in the UK, which saw just a couple of thousand attendees.  Pride in London's 2022 parade will start at Hyde Park Corner at midday, before making its way through Piccadilly and Piccadilly Circus and then turning south on Haymarket. From there it will travel towards Trafalgar Square before finishing in Whitehall at around 6pm. The event is set to see performances from huge stars, and will be headlined by Ava Max. The Trafalgar Square Stage will feature singer Emeli Sandé, Eurovision-winning superstar Netta, pop and soul icon Samantha Mumba, and Hollywood actress and Long Hot Summer singer Kat Graham. Other performers across the stages today include Tony nominee Justin Vivian Bond, stars of Pride’s recent Proud & Loud concert at the Royal Albert Hall Cat Burns and Ariōn, along with Drag Race Superstars The Vivienne, Lawrence Chaney, Tia Kofi and Victoria Scone. Cast members from hit musicals Kinky Boots and Romeo & Juliet will also make an appearance. But gay rights activist and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who helped to organise the first ever Pride event in 1972, yesterday said the parade had become 'too corporate and commercial.' Speaking about the main event, Mr Tatchell said: 'A lot of us are very concerned that the main official Pride event has become too corporate and commercial. 'It often looks like a huge PR, marketing and branding exercise by big companies. 'The human rights dimension has been lost. The original Pride was both a celebration and a protest. 'That's the way it should be this year as well. 'We need to remember that there are still issues to fight for, particularly globally where 69 countries continue to criminalise same sex relations - 12 Muslim majority countries still have the death penalty.' At least 61 countries have reported outbreaks of monkeypox cases. In Europe, the UK leads with the most confirmed infections, followed by Germany, Spain, Portugal and France. The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. But despite these efforts, there are fears that the monkeypox outbreak, combined with a resurgence of coronavirus and an expected early wave of flu, could cause massively increase pressures on the NHS. MailOnline reported yesterday that health officials have said they are expecting an 'early influenza wave' in the UK because there has not been a 'proper' flu season since the start of the Covid pandemic. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said she is watching Australia - currently in its winter season - 'very carefully' after a strain of influenza 'started early and spread fast across all age groups'. She said the country is 'having its worst flu season in five years', which could replicate in the UK as early as September. Meanwhile, Dr Hopkins added that we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox'. There are also mounting fears that the NHS will be struck down at the same time by Covid, with colder weather and darker evenings leading to increased social contact indoors — where viruses find it easier to spread. This year's march will mark the 50th anniversary of Lonodn's first ever Pride parade in 1972, and will be led by veterans of that event and the Gay Liberation Front Previous 1 Next             There is expected to be a focus on the rights of LGBT+ people around the world, as well as the government's refusal to expand the conversion therapy ban to transgender people Flu is a seasonal menace on the NHS, with outbreaks more likely between September and March because colder weather forces more people indoors where the virus — like Covid — finds it easier to spread. But influenza virtually disappeared last winter amid lockdowns aiming to control the spread of Covid. Speaking on Thursday in a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr Hopkins said: 'We are planning for an influenza wave. I don't know if people re following Australia, but we are watching very, very carefully. 'It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave. 'While we normally don't see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October – that's what we're planning for.' She added: 'We will see at least one Covid wave in the autumn-winter, once we have got through the current wave. And, for the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox.' Coronavirus infections have just jumped by 30 per cent, with around 2.3 million people infected last week.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10975461/Monkeypox-cases-UK-rise-1-235-health-officials-issue-warning-ahead-Pride-parade.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox cases are spreading into every region of the UK as vaccination campaign against disease falters, experts warn", "author": "Ethan Ennals For The Mail On Sunday", "date": " 22:26, 6 August 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  cases are now spreading into every region of the country while the vaccination campaign against the virus is faltering, experts have warned. When the virus – which causes painful blisters across the body – first arrived in the UK in May, the vast majority of infections were recorded in  London . Last month, regional cases accounted for only a fifth of the total. But now, more than 2,800 cases have been confirmed, and according to Government figures over a third are in regions outside of London. Particularly high numbers have been seen in the South East, which has recorded more than 230 cases, and the North West, with 150. Currently monkeypox is predominantly infecting gay men and spread through close contact, but the updated figures come as sexual health experts warn that overwhelming demand for the vaccine being offered mean at-risk men are struggling to access it. A long-standing smallpox vaccine has been deployed to inoculate against monkeypox because of the viruses’ high level of similarity. And scientists say a successful vaccination campaign is crucial because the virus can be deadly if it reaches children or pregnant women. Experts have warned the monkeypox vaccine campaign is faltering. Pictured is a man being vaccinated against the disease in Lille, France, today Last week, the US – which has seen more than 6,600 monkeypox cases and declared it a public health emergecy – reported that five children and one pregnant woman have caught the virus. None of the cases was life-threatening, but reports suggest at least ten adults have now died worldwide after catching the disease. The Mail on Sunday was first to report concerns among clinicians of a shortage of monkeypox vaccines last month. Insiders told this newspaper that at least 200,000 doses would be needed, but only 30,000 jabs were on hand. A week later, health chiefs announced they had purchased an extra 100,000. However, London clinicians say supplies are arriving slowly. Previous 1 Next             ‘The majority of London clinics are running out of vaccines on a daily basis and are desperately trying to work with what little they have,’ says Dr John McSorley, a consultant sexual health expert at London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust. ‘Clinics are essentially running like budget airlines – overbooking patients for jabs they don’t have in the hope they’ll have enough on the day.’ Dr McSorley, former president of the British Association For Sexual Health And HIV, said the spread of monkeypox into other regions of the country is the direct effect of this slow rollout. ‘These rising numbers around the country are the result of inaction from the Government. ‘We need to get ahead of this disease while we still have the chance, and the way to do that is to vaccinate faster.’", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11087627/Monkeypox-cases-spreading-region-UK-vaccination-campaign-falters.html"},

It will be sent to the US  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention for confirmation. The case will bring the total number of confirmed cases across America to 114 in 22 states, including the District of Colombia.  'The NJ Health Dept has confirmed the first case of  monkey pox  in Jersey City,' the city's  Instagram  account announced. Our health officials are working closely with the CDC.' The state health department provided further details, confirming it had directed the individual to isolate at home.  'The local health department is conducting contact tracing to identify any individuals who may have been exposed to the individual,' it said. 'Most New Jersey residents are not at risk of infection with monkeypox,' the statement added.  It said no more information will be released due to patient confidentiality.   The CDC stated the US had seen 113 cases by Friday June 17. The New Jersey case will bring the total number of confirmed cases across America to 114 in 22 states Previous 1 Next             The case, if confirmed, will mark New Jersey's first encounter with monkeypox, leaving it far behind California and New York, with 24 cases and 21 cases respectively. Illinois (15) and Florida (10) are also in double figures for the disease, which CDC officials said is being passed on through physical contact with symptomatic patients and by touching their clothing and bedding. Globally, the CDC counts 2,525 total cases across 37 separate countries, with the United Kingdom leading the way with 574 and Spain in second place with 497 confirmed cases of the virus.  Medical literature says that people infected with monkeypox experience flu-like symptoms within the first 21 days of catching the virus, followed by a rash that appears on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But this is rarely being observed in the current outbreak, with patients instead seeing rashes emerge on the genital areas before suffering any flu-like symptoms. Dr Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said: 'The disease is not spread through casual conversations, passing others in a grocery store, or touching things like door-knobs,' she said.  'All of the case we have seen to date in this outbreak have been related to direct contact.' Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Attempting to clear up whether face masks are needed to avoid catching the rash-causing virus, the epidemiologist explained the rash-causing virus would not 'linger in the air' like Covid.  Arizona 1 California 24 Colorado 5 District of Columbia 4 Florida 10 Georgia 3 Hawaii 5 Illinois 15  Maryland 1 Massachusetts 7 Nevada 1 New York 21 Ohio 1 Oklahoma 2 Oregon 1 Pennsylvania 2 Rhode Island 1 Texas 2 Utah 2 Virginia 1 Washington 2  During the conference, health officials also called on Americans with any sexually transmitted infection — including syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia — to get tested for monkeypox.  They warned many patients were experiencing rashes and sores on the genitals and anus that looked like STIs. Several cases of co-infection with monkeypox and a sexually transmitted disease have also been recorded. Health officials also revealed they had distributed more than 1,400 vaccines against the virus to states from their stockpile of more than a million doses. Another 300,000 doses are expected to arrive in the coming weeks. But some experts have raised concerns that the country may not have enough jabs because if the outbreak becomes more widespread there may not be enough to jab the entire country. About three in four cases are currently linked to international travel, including to Europe, while others are linked to someone who has had close contact with a known case. But there are 'several' patients across multiple states who have tested positive despite not recently traveling or having contact with a known case. Dr Jennifer McQuiston, who is leading the CDC's response to the outbreak, said it was likely the case that they acquired the infection from someone who had recently traveled but that this first case was yet to be spotted. She added: 'I can tell you that right now we don't have an area that seems to be having an urban outbreak. There is no one area where it looks like there is a lot of community transmission. 'But this could change. We need to make sure our testing is increasing and ready to catch that when it happens.' Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. It is usually spread through direct contact with animals such as squirrels, which are known to harbour the virus. However, it can also be transmitted through very close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa until now and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. However it can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Monkeypox shuts down some aspects of your body's ability to fight infections. Because of the presence of other viruses and bacteria which your body can't fight off, in the worst cases patients can succumb to a lethal shock throughout the body and blood poisoning. Death is more likely to occur in younger patients. The skin lesions are painful and disfiguring, and can be the source of further infections. Because monkeypox is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. One vaccine, Imvanex, was shown to be around 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox infection. Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10937089/New-Jersey-records-monkeypox-case-taking-total-cases-confirmed-114-20-states.html"},
{"title": "World Health Organization will rename monkeypox because 'it's RACIST and discriminatory towards Africa'", "author": "John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 08:48, 15 June 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox will be renamed following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term, it emerged today. The World Health Organization (WHO) promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  It has already swept the world to strike 45 countries, including Britain, the US, Spain and Portugal. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes. World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed they are in conversation with experts on changing the name for monkeypox Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Previous 1 Next                         A group of scientists from around the world have said the current naming of monkeypox and its clades (different types of the virus) is inaccurate, discriminatory and stigmatising. They say references to West African and Central African monkeypox do not accurately reflect the current monkeypox outbreak sweeping the world. Instead, they suggest ditching terms tied to geography, a move the World Health Organization (WHO) has broadly supported. The scientists have suggested monkeypox in general should now be renamed to MPXV. A number at the end of MPXV would indicate the particular clade of the virus. MPXV1 would indicate Central African monkeypox. MPXV2 for the West African version. And MPXV3 would be term for an offshoot of the West African responsible for pervious and current international outbreaks. But the the scientists add the current outbreak and its sustained human-to-human transmission deserves its own clade.  This would be called hMPXV with letters indicating distinct genetic lineages. With pervious international human-to-human monkeypox outbreaks in 2017-2019 with their own distinct ancestry this would mean the current outbreak would be called hMPXVB.1. While the WHO has said it supports renaming monkeypox, the formal naming of viruses is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses. This international committee of virologists would need to accept any new name for monkeypox for it to become official.   'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.' Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958.  Its naming system currently divides it into two types, the West African version and Central African or Congo Basin version. But experts want them to be replaced with numbers, like MPXV1, MPXV2 and so forth. Naming viruses geographically goes against WHO guidelines because of concerns it may spark abusive backlash or potential racism. It is, for this reason, that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) was not called the Wuhan coronavirus, despite originating in the Chinese city of the same name. Writing in a paper published last week, the coalition of infectious disease researchers from around the world also proposed creating a new 'clade' for the current outbreak. They argue the virus circulating at present has become a distinct 'human virus', compared to MPXV, which rarely transmitted between people. The new type, the experts claimed, should be called hMPXV and lineages should be referred to as A, A.1, A.1.1, B.1. They gave four examples because of data showing the West African strain has evolved slightly, based on samples collected in small human-to-human outbreaks over the past few years. The naming system would be similar system to that used for Covid variants like Omicron, with Britain hit by a wave of BA.2 and now experiencing an uptick in cases of BA.4 and BA.5. One benefit of ditching geographic terms would be encouraging countries to continue monitoring for and raising the alarm when spotting new diseases, rather than having their name negatively attached to it, the scientists said. The responsibility of renaming monkeypox actually lies with the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a committee tasked with formally labelling pathogens. It is not the first time concerns about monkeypox and racism have been raised. Last month the Foreign Press Association, Africa, a media body for journalists on the continent, urged Western media to stop using photos of black people alongside monkeypox stories describing the outbreak in Europe and North America. They accused such outlets of perpetuating 'negative stereotypes that assigns calamity to the African race and privilege of immunity to other races.'  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  Calls to rename monkeypox because of concerns of racism and discrimination echo those regarding some people calling Covid the 'Chinese virus' such as former US President Donald Trump (pictured here at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting last month) Mr Trump was widely condemned over statements referring to Covid as the 'Chinese violence' with some studies finding it increased anti-Asian comments on social media  Global Pride events are an opportunity to spread public health messages about monkeypox and must not be cancelled, an expert has told a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing. Steve Taylor, board member at EuroPride, said the virus – which has been mainly concentrated in gay and bisexual men – must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ events. Mr Taylor told the briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. 'We have been working with WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations and event producers across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves. 'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, was asked why cases have been predominantly in the men who have sex with men. She said: 'All outbreaks start somewhere… this virus doesn’t choose any one person against another, it’s opportunistic in its spread. 'And how it will spread will really be defined by the opportunities it has. 'It’s also a disease that has an incubation period of 21 days. We’re just over a month into this outbreak, understanding that outbreak, so it’s too early to conclude as to how it will be spreading amongst the general population.' They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  The current term monkeypox is already somewhat misleading as while the virus was first discovered in macaques, many cases are believed to be transmitted to humans by rodents. A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections. With milder strains, the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. Dr Ghebreyesus said that 1,600 confirmed monkeypox cases and 1,500 suspected cases have been reported to the WHO this year from 39 countries, 32 of which have been recently hit by the virus.  But other experts tracking the outbreak say at least 45 nations have logged cases or suspected cases.  While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected countries, Dr Tedros said. However, he added that the WHO is seeking to verify news reports from Brazil of a monkeypox-related death there. The UN agency will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid. Officials are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe too unless it is stamped out soon. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses have logged 524 cases in Britain. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10918619/World-Health-Organization-rename-monkeypox-scientists-claimed-RACIST.html"},

'If someone feels sick or has rashes or sores, [we] recommend not attending a gathering and visiting a healthcare provider as soon as possible.' Dr Allison Arwady, its commissioner, added: 'While the risk in Chicago remains low, [we] want the public to be able to make informed choices about gathering in spaces or participating in events where monkeypox could be spread through intimate contact.' Monkeypox primarily spreads through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions or sores on infected patients. But in rare cases it can also be passed on through the air when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. People can only transmit the virus when they have symptoms, unlike with Covid where people can infect others before they show signs of having the virus. On Monday, America recorded its biggest day-on-day rise in infections since the outbreak began. New York City health chiefs are yet to give any details on their new cases to 'protect individuals privacy'. In Massachusetts, health officials said their case was in a man who is currently isolating. They did not say whether the individual was a close contact of another case or had recently returned from abroad. But on Monday a scientist in the state warned that monkeypox was likely already spreading under the radar in the state. Pennsylvania also did not release any details about its new case citing 'privacy' issues. One expert has warned the U.S. may already have more than 300 cases of the rash-causing virus, but that these have been missed due to testing problems and because the disease may be being mis-diagnosed as others. Medical literature says that in the early stages of infection someone may experience flu-like symptoms before developing a rash on the face around three days later. But the CDC says many patients are experiencing rashes in the genital area and around the anus first. In some cases, they are also not developing any flu-like symptoms. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Most cases in America's outbreak have been detected among gay and bisexual men with links to international travel. But a growing number are being detected in close contacts of people these individuals mixed with before testing positive. There are also at least two cases with no links to known cases or international travel which suggests the disease may be spreading under the radar in the country. It comes as the WHO says it will rename monkeypox with a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely also be lettered such as A or B to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes.  'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.'", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10919605/Chicago-urges-people-rashes-not-attend-summer-festivals-case-monkeypox.html"},

Doctors counted 20 lesions over his face, ear, forearms, thighs and back, but the patient did not have a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, and he made a full recovery. None of his close contacts tested positive for monkeypox. It is not clear how he became infected, but testing has ruled out it being down to sexual abuse. The family-of-five said they had no close contact with other guests while on holiday and put their own towels on chairs and loungers. His parents, one of his siblings and a friend — who were all considered high-risk — were vaccinated with the Jynneous jab, which is being used in America.  The report comes as the United States confirms its first two cases of the tropical virus stateside, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The youngster — who has not been named — was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes (pictured is one of the first on his jaw) More than 20 rashes erupted over his body, they said Pictured above is one of the rashes that appeared on his arm  Doctors at the Dutch hospital revealed the diagnosis Thursday in the journal  Eurosurveillance . Dr Marceline van Furth, who led the investigation, said they were publicizing the case to 'raise awareness... that monkeypox can develop in children'. They warned that children — alongside older adults and pregnant women — are more vulnerable to monkeypox, with about three percent dying form the infection. Previous 1 Next             More than 16,000 cases have been detected globally in the current outbreak, mostly among gay or bisexual men who caught the disease through sexual contact. Experts fear the disease has likely already spilled over into other populations, but has not been detected yet because of a lack of testing. Monkeypox does not require sexual contact to spread, and is mainly transmitted via close physical contact or scabs that get stuck on towels or bedding. In rare cases it can also be passed on through the air. America has detected 2,500 cases in the current outbreak — the second highest tally in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. The Netherlands has spotted 700, while Turkey has detected a single case. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  The Dutch monkeypox patient first realized he was unwell shortly after returning from Turkey, when he noticed two small red skin lesions on his left cheek and jaw. His doctor initially diagnosed mild dermatomycosis — medical term for a fungal infection — and prescribed anti-fungal cream. But when more lesions appeared the medic feared he had impetigo — a bacterial infection that causes lesions on the body — and gave him antibiotics. When they continued to crop up over his ear, forearm, thighs and back the boy was referred to hospital with a suspected case of monkeypox — with swabs at the hospital being  positive. His parents and two siblings were then also tested for the virus, but all returned negative results. Dutch health authorities vaccinated both parents, one sibling and a friend who were deemed to be at 'high risk' of being infected. None later developed the virus. An investigation was launched to establish where the child caught the disease, but it was inconclusive. There was no evidence that the child had been near a suspected or confirmed case of monkeypox before catching the disease. The parents also said they had taken care while on holiday to use their own towels and had not had close contact with other guests, limiting the risk of transmission. Analyses revealed the strain the boy caught was the same as the one circulating in Europe's current outbreak. In the paper, the medics wrote: 'As no plausible source could be identified, this leaves us with an open question regarding transmission. 'In the current outbreak, the predominant route of transmission is related to sexual activity in the community of men who have sex with men. 'However, other indirect transmission routes have been described, such as respiratory transmission through droplets or contaminated materials such as bedding and towels. 'Therefore, it is possible that the child was in close contact with an infectious person or contaminated object that was not recognized as such.' They said it typically takes about eight-and-a-half days for someone infected with monkeypox to start showing symptoms. But suggested it was likely longer — up to 21 days — for the boy because the route of transmission was different. He had traveled to Turkey three weeks before symptoms began to appear. His parents said the boy had chickenpox when he was five years old.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11040533/Child-catches-Monkeypox-Boy-10-years-old-infected-disease-Netherlands.html"},

The Windy City's Department of Public Health told DailyMail.com they would put out guidance on social media and print fliers to be handed out at events. In San Francisco,  California , which is also due to host a parade this Sunday, announcements will be made on 'best practice' when in crowds. America is gearing up to celebrate Pride this weekend in major cities —  with crowds expected to exceed two million in New York alone. But it comes amid a growing outbreak of the rash-causing virus with 156 cases detected so far, many among gay and bisexual men, but no deaths. Several cases are not linked to international travel or other known infections suggesting it is already spreading undetected. Although several cities are putting out warnings at Pride events, the national hotspot New York with 28 cases is yet to announce any plans to follow suit. Last weekend doctors in Florida warned Pride attendees to avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact with others in clubs and bars in order to limit their exposure.  The above map shows states that have detected cases of monkeypox, and the tally by state. The red numbers show the change in cases over the last 24 hours Previous 1 Next             The Biden administration has started shipping monkeypox tests to commercial laboratories, in a bid to speed diagnoses for suspected infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' A spokesman for Chicago's Department of Public Health (CDPH) said: 'We will... continue to share facts about monkeypox and how to stay healthy on our social media channels throughout this weekend, with special emphasis on Pride-related events for the many people who will be taking part. 'In addition, CDPH is printing palmcards with a link to a CDC page that provides health tips for gay and bisexual men and a scannable smartphone code for organizers to hand out at events where participants can get additional tips about remaining healthy.' They added that the department had already created a template letter for event organizers to hand out on how to stay safe against monkeypox. Chicago is expecting more than 100,000 people to flock to its Pride parade this Sunday. San Francisco — which is set to host more than 500,000 people for its own parade — is also planning to put out warnings over monkeypox. Its Pride organizers told DailyMail.com: 'The Department of Health will be making public service announcements specific to monkeypox with best practices. '[This will be] as people gather, and together we are taking every precaution to ensure we are all able to have a safe and fun time during this year’s Pride celebrations.' But New York City health officials — who could be hosting as many as two million people this weekend — are yet to announce any plans to warn people over monkeypox. When contacted, the city's Department of Health directed DailyMail.com to a guidance page on its website. This told people who felt unwell to avoid 'clubs, parties or gatherings', and not to have sex or close physical contact if they or their partner are sick. Monkeypox — native to West Africa — has now been detected more than 3,000 times across 40 countries where it is not typically found.  No deaths have been recorded, but health officials warn it could spill over into more vulnerable populations if the outbreak is not contained. The doctors warned people to avoid skin-to-skin contact that is prolonged during a briefing yesterday. Pictured above from left to right is Dr Margaret Gorensek, an infectious disease expert at Holy Cross Medical Group, Dr Zachary Henry, a sexual health expert at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and Dr Frank Vittimberga, the chief medical officer for the Florida Medical Center The tropical disease is primarily spread through physical contact with infectious rashes, but in rare cases it can also be transmitted through 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Many patients have rashes on their genital area and anus as a first warning sign, before the disease spreads to the rest of the body. It can take up to four weeks to get better from the disease, with most cases being mild and clearing up on their own. Someone remains infectious until their rashes have scabbed over and eventually fallen off. Last week doctors in Florida said Pride attendees should avoid 'prolonged' skin-to-skin contact in clubs and bars in order not to catch monkeypox. Speaking at a briefing ahead of celebrations in Fort Lauderdale, Dr Zachary Henry — who spotted a case of monkeypox in his clinic — also warned people to stay away from others with unusual rashes. The sexual health expert at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation added there was no need to wear face masks because the tropical disease took 'hours' to spread through the air between people.  Henry — appearing with Dr Margaret Gorensek — was speaking ahead of a Pride march in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last Saturday which could draw more than 100,000 spectators. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10945799/Chicago-special-emphasis-warning-Pride-attendees-monkeypox-cases.html"},
{"title": "Brazilians have started poisoning MONKEYS over misplaced fears that they are to blame for growing monkeypox outbreak", "author": "Chris Jewers For Mailonline", "date": " 12:55, 10 August 2022 ", "text": "Brazilians have started poisoning monkeys over misplaced fears they are to blame for the growing  monkeypox  virus outbreak. At least 10 monkeys had been poisoned in less than a week in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, in Sao Paulo state, local reports said. Similar incidents were reported in other cities, prompting the World Health Organisation on Tuesday to urge people not to kill the animals over the virus. 'People have to know that the transmission we see now is among humans,' said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, during a press conference in Geneva. Brazil counts more than 1,700 cases of monkeypox, according to the WHO. The country's health ministry confirmed one death related to the disease on July 29 - a man who had low immunity and comorbidities. Contagion can take place from animals to humans, but the recent outbreak is related to human only contacts, Harris said. Brazilians have started poisoning monkeys over misplaced fears they are to blame for the growing monkeypox outbreak. Brazilian news website G1 reported on Sunday that 10 monkeys had been poisoned in less than a week in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, in Sao Paulo state. Similar incidents were reported in other cities. Pictured: A monkey is seen in Brazil (file photo) 'People certainly should not attack the animals,' she said. 'The transmission we are seeing now with the large outbreak of monkeypox is the person-to-person transmission. 'The virus is in some animals, and we see a jump in humans, but that's not what we're seeing now. The risk of transmission comes from another human being.' Harris stressed that the concern should instead be about where the virus is circulating in populations, and the steps people can take to protect themselves.  The best way to tackle the virus, Harris said, is for 'people [to] recognise they have symptoms and go get help and medical care and take precautions to prevent it being transmitted'. Raising awareness among at-risk groups is key to this, she said. The virus spreads through close contact, and most cases so far have been registered among men who have sex with men. The WHO has urged people not to stigmatise any people who are infected. Previous 1 Next             'Any stigmatisation of any person infected is going to increase the transmission, because if people are afraid of identifying themselves as being infected, then they will not get care and will not take precautions,' Harris said,  the Guardian reported . 'So do not stigmatise any animal or any human, because if you do do that, we will have a much larger outbreak,' she added. Brazil has a long register of attacks on monkeys during yellow fever outbreaks too. Since May, nearly 90 countries have reported more than 29,000 cases of monkeypox. The WHO classified the outbreak of the once-rare disease as an international emergency in July. Monkeypox is usually a mild to moderate infection that leads to flu-like symptoms and characteristic pus-filled skin lesions. The viral disease has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades, and was first reported this year outside those countries in May. The World Health Organization expressed sorrow on Tuesday for the killing of the animals in Brazil amid growing fears of contagion, and stressed that monkeys are not spreading the virus. Pictured: Vials of Imvanex, a vaccine to protect against Monkeypox, are seen in France Health officials in Europe are currently discussing whether to follow a move by the United States to stretch out scarce monkeypox vaccine supplies, with the World Health Organization calling for more data. There have been 27,800 monkeypox cases - largely among men who have sex with men - and 12 deaths worldwide this year. Supplies of the key Bavarian Nordic shot, the only vaccine authorized to prevent monkeypox and a key part of the global public health response, are scarce, according to WHO and other government health agencies. On Tuesday, the U.S. backed using one vial of the vaccine to administer up to five separate doses - instead of a single dose - by injecting a smaller amount in between layers of the skin.  The vaccine was designed to be injected into a layer of fat beneath the skin. This so-called 'dose-sparing' approach has been tried before with other vaccines, including for polio and yellow fever, but evidence is limited on whether it could work for monkeypox. 'The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will discuss the possibility of a dose-sparing approach,' an EMA spokesperson told Reuters, adding the regulator would discuss the strategy with the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, and European countries. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The WHO 'encourages the use of vaccines within trials that will help to gather relevant information for their use in this outbreak,' a spokesperson told Reuters by email. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, data collected in a 2015 clinical study demonstrated that dose-sparing could work without sacrificing the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Meanwhile, some governments in Europe are taking other steps to extend existing supplies. For instance, Britain is offering just one shot of the two-dose regimen to people most at risk as a temporary measure to afford at least some protection to a greater number of people. It is unclear whether either approach will result in adequate protection against monkeypox. Since May, nearly 90 countries have reported more than 29,000 cases of monkeypox. The WHO classified the outbreak of the once-rare disease as an international emergency in July  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Friday there were 'early signs' that the monkeypox outbreak is plateauing across the country and that its expansion has slowed. 'While the most recent data suggests the growth of the outbreak has slowed, we cannot be complacent,' Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said. There were 2,859 confirmed and highly probable cases of monkeypox in the UK as of Aug. 4, with nearly 99% of the cases among men, the country's health authority said in a statement. The recent analysis by the UKHSA showed that 'monkeypox continues to be transmitted primarily in interconnected sexual networks of gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men', it added. British authorities in June were recommending gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox be offered a vaccine, as the outbreak of the viral disease had gathered pace, mostly in Europe. Individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox are being offered the smallpox vaccine, Dr Chand said. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11098669/Brazilians-poisoning-MONKEYS-misplaced-fears-blame-monkeypox-outbreak.html"},

The sexual health expert at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation added there was no need to wear face masks because the tropical disease took 'hours' to spread through the air between people. Scientists say monkeypox spreads through touching infectious lesions on patients. They may be anywhere on the body — including the face, arms and genitals.

Henry — appearing with Dr Margaret Gorensek — was speaking ahead of a Pride march in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this Saturday which could draw more than 100,000 spectators. Most states such as New York and Chicago, Illinois, will hold their celebrations next weekend. Both experts warned monkeypox was likely already spreading undetected in Florida, after a scientist said earlier this week it was also transmitting under the radar in Massachusetts. America has recorded 100 cases of monkeypox so far, with Maryland and Oregon now being the twentieth and twenty-first states to spot the rash-causing virus. Globally more than 1,000 infections have been detected across 35 nations in the 'biggest outbreak' outside of Africa — where it is native — to date. But no deaths have been registered yet. America's monkeypox cases tally has now hit 100. The table on the left shows the number of cases in each state, and the number of infections recorded per state over the last 24 hours.

Pictured above from left to right is Dr Margaret Gorensek, an infectious disease expert at Holy Cross Medical Group, Dr Zachary Henry, a sexual health expert at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and Dr Frank Vittimberga, the chief medical officer for the Florida Medical Center Organizers of the Pride parade in Fort Lauderdale say it is expected to attract up to 100,000 people. Pictured above is a previous parade in the city  Speaking at the town hall on monkeypox, Henry said: 'Going out at Pride, going to the stores, the restaurants, the bars — if you are avoiding prolonged skin-to-skin contact that should be safe. 'The only other method of transmitting monkeypox is through respiratory droplets, but that's rare. 'If you are not touching someone, you would need to be indoors without a mask for several hours — if not more — to catch it. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  'So you can go outside at the Parade, don't be afraid to go for pubs and bars but watch for the rashes and look at what is on their body.' He added: 'Essentially you don't want prolonged skin-to-skin contact with someone who has that rash. 'For people who might recreationally enjoy dark rooms or commercial sex clubs where you can't see what's on the person's body — now is not the time to be there.' Gorensek, an infectious disease specialist from the state's Holy Cross Medical Group, warned people to 'minimize' skin-to-skin contact.  'There would be less risk going to concerts and gatherings — that is not high risk,' she said. 'But skin-to-skin contact puts you more in that category. 'We don't have a high number of cases [in Florida] but we can get to that point.' Zachary explained the monkeypox patient he treated had started developing rashes about a day after having sex with another individual. He said this suggested that the case had been infected before having sex with that person by another, as yet un-identified, person. The person he had sex with was also now likely infected. Columbus in Ohio and Portland in Oregon — which have each detected one monkeypox case — are also due to hold Pride parades this weekend. But neither has issued any guidance on how to stay safe from the tropical disease during the celebrations. The organizers of New York City pride — which attracts up to two million people and is the largest in America —  have, however, issued guidance on how to protect yourself against the disease. In an Instagram post on Monday they called on anyone with a rash who did not feel unwell not to attend events.  They also said anyone experiencing a fever, headache or swollen glands should contact their health provider for testing.  They said: 'The risk to most people still remains low, but knowledge empowers our community to protect its health.' Chicago also warned people who did not feel well or had an unusual rash to stay away from summer parties and festivals this week. America has now recorded 100 cases of monkeypox across 21 states with the most in California, New York and Illinois. Many infections are among gay and bisexual men and linked back to international travel. But a growing number are among people with no links to foreign travel or another known case — suggesting the virus is spreading in the country under the radar. New York City Pride organizers have also issued guidance for people looking to attend the parades. They call on those with a rash or who feel unwell to 'stay away' It comes after DailyMail.com revealed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had published bizarre guidance on how to have sex while infected with monkeypox. It states that anyone who is infected with the disease should not have sex. But for those who ignore the advice, it has published a list of the dos and donts under the bedsheets. Among its tips was to masturbate at least six feet away from your partner and also to have sex while still fully-clothed ensuring all rashes are covered. Other advice was to avoid kissing, wash hands, fetish gear and clothes immediately afterwards and even to consider having sex virtually such as over the phone. People catch monkeypox by touching infectious skin lesions, but it can also be spread through the air during 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It can take up to four weeks for anyone infected with monkeypox to recover from the disease, with about eight days needed from infection for symptoms to appear.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10927345/Avoid-prolonged-skin-skin-contact-clubs-Pride-monkeypox-Florida-docs-say.html"},
{"title": "America recorded 16 monkeypox cases last weekend bringing total to 65 as outbreak hits seventeenth state Ohio", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:54, 14 June 2022 ", "text": "Another 16  monkeypox  cases were spotted across the United States this weekend, bringing the total number of cases of the rare disease to 65. Health officials revealed the updated tally Tuesday, covering the period from Friday evening up to 2 p.m. Monday. Infections were reported in six states, with the most in national hotspot  California  - which saw its tally rise by five to 15 patients. Over the last three days  Ohio  also detected its first case of monkeypox, although no details were given to protect the patient's privacy.  Chicago's case count doubled to eight patients, with at least one case in Illinois' largest city linked to annual fetish conference Mr Leather that took place last month. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials are scrambling to contain the outbreak before the tropical disease gains a foothold in the U.S. But Monday a scientist warned there may already be 'undetected transmission chains' in Massachusetts after the state spotted two cases that were not linked to another known infection. Globally, more than 1,600 cases have been detected across more than four dozen countries outside of its native West Africa — with most in the UK (470), Spain (307) and Portugal (209). Previous 1 Next             Monkeypox could be spread through semen, scientists say. Medical literature says the disease is transmitted primarily through touching infectious skin lesions on patients. In limited cases it may also be passed on through the air if someone has 'sustained' face-to-face contact with an infected person. But now scientists in Italy say they have detected fragments of the virus in the semen of a handful of patients, suggesting it could also be transmitted through this route. Researchers at the Spallanzani Institute, in Rome, said six out of seven patients they checked had semen containing genes from the virus. In one sample there was enough virus to suggest it could infect another patient. Dr Francesco Vaia, its director general, said: 'Having an infectious virus in semen is a factor that tips the balance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that sexual transmission is one of the ways in which this virus is transmitted.' Today's cases update is the biggest surge for a three-day period so far, up 160 percent from the six registered the weekend before. Hawaii also reported another two cases after officials there warned the rash-causing virus was likely spreading 'in our community'. There was one case in Colorado, Georgia and Ohio each. Health officials in Ohio refused to give any details about their first case in order to 'protect the patient's privacy'. Most cases in America are being detected among gay and bisexual men and linked to international travel. But a growing number are being spotted in people who had close contact with a known patient, or those who are not close contacts and have not recently traveled. The CDC has so far brushed off concerns about these cases, however, saying they are likely linked to an undiagnosed case in a traveler. It also says America is yet to detect any major outbreaks in urban centers unlike nations struggling against the disease in Europe. Yesterday Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned monkeypox was likely already spreading under the radar in Massachusetts. He told DailyMail.com that the state's latest cases 'certainly indicate undetected transmission chains, although at this stage we can't say whether they are linked to the previous case in Massachusetts or are a separate introduction'. He added: 'I noticed that [Health officials in the state] have urged \"vigilance\". I think it is extremely appropriate. 'People should be aware of the symptoms — fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash — but also remember that the rash might not look like the photos in the papers which tend to be of people suffering from a different strain of the virus, with an extensive disseminated rash.' On Sunday the state reported two cases in men that were close contacts of each other but not linked to its first patient reported about a month ago. Health officials also did not say whether the patients — who were from the Boston area — had recently returned from international travel. In Rhode Island, health officials said their first case — a man in his 30s — was 'believed to be related to travel to Massachusetts'. It is not clear whether he was linked to these latest cases, the first patient or another as yet unidentified transmission chain.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10915367/America-recorded-16-monkeypox-cases-weekend-bringing-total-65.html"},

The patient will remain for treatment at Attica Hospital for the next 20 days at least to undergo further examinations in a controlled environment, local outlets reported.

But most cases in the ongoing surge are among the 'sexual networks' of men who have sex with men.

But it is thought to be the main mode of transmission in the ongoing outbreak. The virus, first discovered in lab monkeys in the 1950s, can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone who is infected.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10941087/British-tourist-30-loaded-helicopter-sealed-capsule-getting-monkeypox-Greece.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox could become endemic in US in what would be 'the worst public health failure in modern times' because it could have been prevented, former FDA director Scott Gottlieb says as infections rise to 5,189", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 17:25, 1 August 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  becoming endemic in the U.S. would be the 'worst public health failure in modern times' because it could have been prevented, an ex-Food and Drug Administration director has said. Writing in an op-ed over the weekend, Dr Scott Gottlieb pointed out that — unlike when Covid first emerged — there were already reliable vaccines and tests available to stop the disease in its tracks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) failed to act rapidly, instead following the same 'protracted checklist' and making many of the same mistakes as when Covid struck. He wrote in the  New York Times  that should the disease gain a foothold it would be a disaster both because it could have been prevented and as infections — which spark blisters across body — are painful. Many sufferers have said their symptoms were 'worse than Covid'. Last month Gottlieb predicted the tally of cases — then 1,800 — were just a fraction of the actual number. Since then it has risen to more than 5,000 with the CDC now detecting about 250 new infections per day. It is the second time Gottlieb has spoken out over the CDC response. Previously, he warned the slow pace left a risk of the virus becoming endemic in the country Writing in the op-ed, Gottlieb said: 'If monkeypox gains a permanent foothold in the United States and becomes an endemic virus that joins our circulating repertoire of pathogens, it will be one of the worst public health failures in modern times. 'Not only because of the pain and peril of the disease, but also because it was so avoidable.' Previous 1 Next             Indian authorities reported Asia's first possible monkeypox fatality on Monday after the death of a man who recently returned from United Arab Emirates testing positive. Kerala state's health ministry said tests on the 22-year-old 'showed that the man had monkeypox'.   Four monkeypox-related fatalities have so far been reported outside Africa in an outbreak that the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency. The Indian man died in Kerala on July 30 around a week after returning from the UAE and being taken to hospital. It was unclear however whether monkeypox was the cause of death. 'The youth had no symptoms of monkeypox. He had been admitted to a hospital with symptoms of encephalitis and fatigue,' the Indian Express daily quoted Kerala's health minister Veena George as saying on Sunday. The other monkeypox fatalities are: Two in Spain, one in Brazil, one in Ghana, three in Nigeria and two in the Central African Republic.  He added: 'When about 100 cases of monkeypox had been confirmed or suspected in Europe in May, it was clear the virus was spreading outside the areas where it was previously seen. These reports should have been code red for the CDC. 'But it wasn't until late June that the agency expanded testing for monkeypox to large commercial labs like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp for more capacity and access. 'Time is running out. Diseases like Zika, Covid and monkeypox are a dire warning that dangerous pathogens are on the march. 'The next one could be worse — a deadly strain of flu or something more sinister like Marburg virus. 'We've now had ample notice that the nation continues to be unprepared and that our vulnerabilities are enormous.' Gottlieb also called for the CDC to be re-focussed specifically to fighting infectious diseases.  He said cancer and heart disease could be handled by the National Institutes of Health, while smoking could be moved to the Food and Drug Administration. Gottlieb has previously briefed reporters that the window for stopping the disease turning endemic in the U.S. was likely already closing, if not had already closed. He said at the time that the national tally — then-1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the total because of poor testing coverage. Since then, it has risen to more than 5,000 cases. He also warned monkeypox had likely already spread outside of gay or bisexual men, but that this was yet to be detected. Again, it has since been detected in two children — one living in California and the other passing through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman. It came after New York became the first state to declare monkeypox a 'disaster emergency' over the weekend. New York governor Kathy Hochul announced late Friday that monkeypox is now a state disaster emergency as her administration struggles to disperse vaccines to contain the spread. People pictured queuing for the monkeypox vaccine in New York City today Lines forming for getting a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine. Second doses are being delayed due to a lack of jabs available Appointments have been available to sign up to via a link, with more being released by the City's department of health The announcement comes as monkeypox cases rise in New York City, the current US epicenter of the outbreak, where case counts passed 1,400 on Friday. Hochul tweeted: 'I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our ongoing efforts to confront the monkeypox outbreak. 'This Executive Order enables us to respond more swiftly, and allows health care professionals to take additional steps that will help get more New Yorkers vaccinated.' Hochul continued: 'More than one in four monkeypox cases in this country are in New York, currently having a disproportionate impact on at-risk groups. 'We are working around the clock to secure more vaccines, expand testing capacity, and educate New Yorkers on how to stay safe.' Monkeypox is currently hitting gay men the hardest, with an estimated 95 per cent of US infections occurring among them.

{"title": "US hits record 1,424 new monkeypox cases in a single day on Monday: Fears grow there may be outbreaks across college campuses as students return to school this month", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:37, 9 August 2022 ", "text": "The U.S. logged a record 1,424  monkeypox  cases on Monday, the highest total since the global outbreak first found its way stateside in May. It comes as officials are starting to raise concerns about the virus running rampant on college campuses during the upcoming semester. Monday's figures bring America's overall case total to 8,934 - putting the U.S. on track to be the first nation to eclipse 9,000 confirmed infection when officials report new figures Tuesday. It is likely that these figures are a severe undercount because of the lack of testing. This outbreak could soon get worse as well. The new school year is set to begin at colleges and universities across the U.S. in the coming weeks. Young students are more likely to engage in careless sexual behavior, creating a perfect storm for potential monkeypox outbreaks around the nation. Unlike Covid in 2020, many universities also do not have dedicated response plans to the virus either - making rampant spread even more likely once the virus is brought onto campus. 'As we head into the fall, I'm concerned about outbreaks on college campuses as they are often a place where individuals engage in higher risk sexual activity and are in close contact with many different people,' Dr Rachel Cox, an assistant professor in at the Mass General Health Institute of Health Professionals, told  CNN .  'We need to make sure we're prepared to allocate resources like tests, vaccines, and antivirals to places that may become hotspots.'  Not all experts believe the outbreak will absolutely spiral out of control, though. Dr Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and current board member at pharma-giant Pfizer, told  CBS' Face the Nation  on Sunday that while difficult, it is possible to prevent monkeypox from becoming an endemic virus - a prospect officials likely failed with Covid. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that America's monkeypox outbreak can still be controlled He says that the response to the virus has to be wider to control it, though. At the moment, testing has mainly been reserved to just gay and bisexual men - who make up a overwhelming majority of cases. Gottlieb believes that more cases would be found if testing was expanded beyond just that community. ‘There’s a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Gottlieb said. 'We’re continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.’ While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that they still make up a majority of cases. America is facing a shortage of both testing and vaccines at the moment, though, meaning that they have been reserved for men who have sex with other men to this point. The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point.  Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained. 'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate. 'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11095563/US-records-record-1-424-new-monkeypox-cases-Monday.html"},
{"title": "'Every American should pay attention on monkeypox': Officials warn the virus outbreak will not only affect gay men - as US becomes global hotspot with 4,639 cases", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 20:10, 28 July 2022 ", "text": "Every American should 'pay attention' to the  monkeypox  outbreak because the disease could spill over into more groups than just gay men, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned Thursday — as U.S. cases topped 4,600 to become the highest tally in the world. Dr Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, issued the stark warning during a press briefing, adding that infections with the disease were 'painful' and could also be dangerous. He did insist it was 'absolutely' still possible for the U.S. to eliminate monkeypox. The vast majority of cases are still among gay or bisexual men, but last week America recorded its first two cases in children — in a toddler in  California  and infant traveling through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman who tested positive when she was near full-term. Top experts have been warning for weeks that other groups could catch the disease because it does not require sexual contact to transmit, but only close contact such as hugs or brushing the rashes of an infected person. Becerra's comments came after the U.S. infection tally surged by 1,048 cases on Thursday to become the highest in the world, with officials warning it was set to continue to rise for 'weeks'. California and New York accounted for 75 percent of the rise, which was blamed on 'historic' cases being added to the tally. No deaths have been reported in the U.S. yet, with only one registered in Nigeria so far in this global outbreak of more than 20,000 cases. But there are concerns that should the disease spread to more vulnerable groups — including children and pregnant women — more fatalities will be recorded.  Dr Xevier Becerra, who heads up the Department of Health and Human Services, warned all Americans should be worried about the spread of monkeypox. Captain Jennifer McQuiston, who is involved with the response at the CDC, warned that cases would likely continue to rise for weeks             Lyme vaccine testing begins         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Russian 'holidaymaker' breaks down in tears after fleeing Crimea         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         MailOnline looks at Samsung's new foldable phones and accessories         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey     At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) conference, Becerra warned: 'Every American should pay attention on monkeypox.  'Monkeypox is not Covid, but it is contagious, it is painful and it can be dangerous. At the HHS our goal is — stay ahead of the virus, and to stop the outbreak. We are doing everything we can in that regard.' He added: 'On the question can we not only stay ahead but end this outbreak — absolutely. We believe we have done everything we can at the Federal level [for this].' Previous 1 Next                   A pregnant woman has tested positive for monkeypox in the United States, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief revealed yesterday. The woman has now given birth to her child, who does not appear to have caught the rash-causing virus from the mother. CDC released limited information on the case, including where in the US the woman was based. It's also unclear when the woman was infected, or exactly when she gave birth. Health officials said both were 'doing well', but the nation's top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that pregnant woman may face a 'profound risk' from the virus. A maternity doctor told DailyMail.com that women in the early stages of pregnancy faced the biggest risk from monkeypox. The mother may have been in the final stages of her pregnancy when infected, as she recently gave birth. The newborn received immune globin, an infusion of antibodies capable of fighting diseases including monkeypox, officials said. It is not clear what treatment the mother received. It is the first infection to be detected in a pregnant woman in the United States, and comes after America recorded its first two infections in children last week. The pediatric cases were unrelated and detected in California and Washington D.C. Becerra also called on every American offered the vaccine to get one, pointing out that even with Covid — which may still be more deadly than monkeypox — many Americans have still not got the jab. Nearly 800,000 more doses of the vaccine have arrived in the United States and are now being made available to states, they revealed today. This is more than double the total 338,000 that have been dished out so far. Health officials also say a further 5.5 million are due to arrive by May next year, with another 11.1 million in storage to be called upon if the outbreak worsens. Most states are currently rolling out vaccines to close contacts of reported cases, with New York City and Washington D.C. offering them to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual contacts in a fortnight. Both have cut plans to offer a second dose — usually given 28 days after the first — due to a lack of supply. Yesterday top officials also took to the airwaves to warn men who have sex with men to 'limit' their sexual contacts to help curb the spread of the disease. Dr Jennifer McQuiston, a pathology expert at the CDC, told the briefing almost every monkeypox case had been spotted in a man, with the 'vast majority' saying they had sex with other men. They were aged 35 years on average, with the oldest being 76. About two-fifths of cases were detected among white men, while another two-fifths were in the hispanic population and almost 30 percent were among black individuals. Four percent were Asian. Almost every case has experienced a rash during their infection, with fatigue, fever and swollen lymph nodes making up the rest of the four most common symptoms. No deaths from the disease have been reported in the U.S. to date, but there are mounting fears that it could spill over into more vulnerable groups including children and pregnant women. The disease only requires physical contact to spread — such as cuddles or brushing the arm of an infected person — or can be picked up from scabs from a patient left on bedding. Sexual contact is not necessary. This week the CDC revealed the first two cases in children — in a toddler from California and an infant who was traveling through Washington D.C.. Another infection was also detected in a pregnant woman, although the location has not been disclosed. Health officials say all cases are 'doing well'. But data suggests children under eight years old are at higher risk of severe disease than adults. Pregnant woman are also more at risk, particularly those in the first ten weeks of pregnancy where the disease could lead to abnormalities in organs forming in the baby. Other experts have warned monkeypox has likely already spilled over to other groups, but that this is not being detected yet because officials are doing too few tests. Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the HHS, said there were a further 11.1million doses available to the U.S. in Denmark that were currently in storage. She said these would be deployed with further funding from Congress, and if it was deemed necessary should cases escalate.  Yesterday another 1,048 cases of monkeypox were recorded in the U.S., with McQuiston saying most of this number was 'historic' with infections only now being added to the tally. It makes the U.S. outbreak the largest in the world, with Spain — among the first countries to record cases — behind with 3,738 infections alongside Germany with 2,540. But when the data is looked at in terms of population — which is more accurate because it takes into account country sizes — it shows out of the top ten countries with the highest case tally the U.S. has the eighth largest outbreak. At the top of the table is Spain, with the most cases per resident, followed by Portugal and the Netherlands.              Lyme vaccine testing begins         Thrillseekers have miraculous escape as flying carpet ride collapses         Wendy Williams seem disorientated as she steps out in NYC         Russian 'holidaymaker' breaks down in tears after fleeing Crimea         Waterpark cancels birthday party for black teen as family arrives         Moment swimming wild boar emerges from the sea startling bathers         MailOnline looks at Samsung's new foldable phones and accessories         Outdoor space converted into a garden but viewers are not convinced         Tesla in self-driving mode runs over child-sized mannequin in test         Hilarious moment woman takes a tumble after cycling home drunk         Leylah Dobinson's incredible transformation into Marilyn Monroe         Cat owner invents flap that bans pet from coming home with prey    ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11058219/Every-American-pay-attention-monkeypox-HHS-officials-warning.html"},
{"title": "Indiana and Missouri record first suspected cases of monkeypox as US official infection tally reaches 111", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:43, 20 June 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  is continuing its spread across the U.S., with  Indiana  and Missouri logging their first potential cases over the weekend - and official figures reach the 111 mark. One case was detected by  Kansas  City, Missouri, health officials on Saturday, with a resident who had recently traveled domestically testing positive for the orthopox family of viruses that includes monkeypox. State health officials in Indiana also revealed they had detected a potential case in an undisclosed part of the state. Samples from both persons will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to confirm if they are monkeypox infections with results expected in the coming days. The Midwest and Great Plains regions of the U.S. had largely been spared from the rare tropical virus so far, with only Ohio and Illinois having recorded cases before the weekend. Though it is possible that the virus has been circulating in the region before these two recent cases were logged and just were not picked up by surveillance. In total, the U.S. has confirmed 111 cases - with neither of the cases in Indiana and Missouri being included in official figures yet - with New York and California suffering the worst outbreaks with nearly two dozen infections each. Just over 2,500 cases have been detected worldwide, with the 574 cases in the UK being the most. No deaths have been tied to the recent monkeypox outbreak in countries where it is not endemic. Cases from Missouri and Indiana have not yet been added to official CDC case figures as federal officials work to confirm them. Over the weekend, the case tally rose from 100 to 111 Previous 1 Next             'This week, one of our excellent nurses suspected one of our patients may have monkeypox virus,' Dr Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department said. 'We are considering this a probable case of monkeypox virus until we receive final confirmation from the CDC labs.'   The case would be the first in the state of Missouri. Neighboring Illinois and Oklahoma has also recorded cases of monkeypox during this outbreak. If the cases in Missouri and Indiana are confirmed then it would bring America's infection count to 113. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  Officials in both states are also undergoing contact tracing measures to notify others who have may been exposed to the virus. While the exact symptoms being faced by each infected person has not been revealed, the CDC warns that common symptoms include rashes, blisters on the hands, feet, arms, genitals and other areas of the body, muscle aches and fatigue among others. The agency also warns that many may mistake the pox that come as part of the infection - the most obvious sign a person has contracted the virus - with STIs like syphilis. Monkeypox usually spreads by body-to-body contact with the infectious lesions on a person's body, though it can also be transmitted through sustained face-to-face contact. Patients are expected to first experience a fever within three weeks, followed by a rash that covers the face, and then the rest of the body. Last week, the CDC warned that many patients were not experiencing the typical symptoms. The agency reports that many were developing the rashes before fevers, with some never experiencing a fever at all. Rashes were being recorded in the mouth and genital area or anus, which has not previously been associated with the illness. The patterns of lesions appearing around the body were not consistent either. Almost all cases in the U.S. have been tied to international travel, either to an African nation where the virus is endemic or to a European country that has experienced significant spread. Some cases have no links to travel, though, indicating multiple examples of human-to-human transmission on U.S. soil. Gay and bisexual men in particular have suffered the largest burden of infections, with the virus believed to be spreading through the sexual network. Outbreaks have been tied to wo sex-raves in Belgium and Spain, and a recent Mr Leather fetish event in Chicago, Illinois, is believed to be at the center of another cluster of cases.  This has left some worried that Pride parades this June will be sources of rampant monkeypox spread. Doctors and community leaders are encouraging people to still attend these events, but to take precautions. Speaking at the town hall on monkeypox, Henry said: 'Going out at Pride, going to the stores, the restaurants, the bars — if you are avoiding prolonged skin-to-skin contact that should be safe. 'The only other method of transmitting monkeypox is through respiratory droplets, but that's rare. 'If you are not touching someone, you would need to be indoors without a mask for several hours — if not more — to catch it. 'So you can go outside at the Parade, don't be afraid to go for pubs and bars but watch for the rashes and look at what is on their body.' He added: 'Essentially you don't want prolonged skin-to-skin contact with someone who has that rash. 'For people who might recreationally enjoy dark rooms or commercial sex clubs where you can't see what's on the person's body — now is not the time to be there.' Gorensek, an infectious disease specialist from the state's Holy Cross Medical Group, warned people to 'minimize' skin-to-skin contact. 'There would be less risk going to concerts and gatherings — that is not high risk,' she said. 'But skin-to-skin contact puts you more in that category.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10934743/Indiana-Missouri-record-presumptive-cases-monkeypox.html"},

After THREE YEARS of Covid cancellations, tens of thousands party into the night joined by dozens of A-list celebs as Billie Eilish slams US abortion ruling on stage at Britain's biggest festival", "author": "Adam Solomons For Mailonline", "date": " 09:45, 25 June 2022 ", "text": "Glastonbury made a glorious return after three years as revellers resisted nationwide rail strikes and thunderstorm fears to bury memories of Covid at the world's most iconic music festival. An estimated 200,000 music fans flocked to Worthy Farm, east Somerset for the 37th iteration of Glasto, which is also the world's biggest outdoor festival. For the first time ever Glastonbury's festivities started as early as Thursday, with thousands setting up camp by Tuesday. Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is set to speak to a huge crowd from the Pyramid Stage at 5.15pm today ahead of a set by Californian female rock group Haim. Thunberg tweeted two pictures from the Somerset campsite, stating she was 'excited' to make the 'special appearance'.  This year's music headliners include  Paul McCartney , Kendrick Lamar and  Billie Eilish , who in her explosive Pyramid Stage set last night slammed the US  Supreme Court 's abortion rights overhaul. Eilish, 20, last night made history as the youngest ever star to headline Glastonbury. She delivered a stellar medley of hits alongside big brother Finneas in an edgy look that consisted of an oversized T-shirt and matching shorts for tens of thousands of waiting fans.  Taking to the stage, she said it was a  'dark day for women' following the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe V Wade, as she took to the stage at the Glastonbury Festival on Friday. The singer, 20, who first made her debut at the festival on The Other Stage at Worthy Farm in 2019, told the crowd she 'couldn't bear to think about' the ruling which ended the constitutional right to abortion in the US, meaning individual states could decide whether abortion can be made illegal. Also prominent at the festival were many   - a nod to the PM's claim that lockdown-busting gatherings were not parties.   And Sir Paul McCartney last night prepared for Glastonbury, one of the biggest gigs of his career, by playing one of the smallest. Sir Paul, 80, delivered a preview of his Glastonbury set to an audience of around 800 at the Cheese and Grain – a not-for-profit venue in a former agricultural warehouse in the town of Frome in Somerset. Fans had scrambled to pick up tickets in person after the secret gig was announced at 5pm on Thursday.

Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, 19, is set to make a 'special appearance' at Glastonbury tonight. The teen will address a crowd of tens of thousands from the Pyramid Stage at 5.15pm before female rock group Haim performs. Thunberg has continued to host regular school strikes in her native Sweden. It wasn't immediately clear how she made it to the UK. Adopting an English accent, she added: 'How are you doin?' Paul McCartney will play tonight's coveted Saturday night set, with US rapper Kendrick Lamar closing out the festival tomorrow evening. Showers hit the festival yesterday morning - and there are fears of heavy rain tomorrow and showers on Sunday afternoon. And celebrities weren't just spotted on stage, either. A-listers including Kate Moss, Games of Thrones actors Kit Harington and his wife Rose Leslie, model Daisy Lowe and Love Island host Laura Whitmore were among the VIPs pictured yesterday at Worthy Farm. Some revellers were pictured waving Partygate-themed flags ribbing Boris Johnson at the music festival. Several flags read 'this is a work event' - a nod to the PM's claim that lockdown-busting gatherings were not parties.  It comes after Mr Johnson suffered two damaging defeats in the Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton by-elections. Billie was among several stars who took to the stage on the third day of Glastonbury, with Griff taking to the John Peel stage at the festival.

Completing her look with a pair of black shoes and white socks, she soon threw a guitar over her shoulders by its strap as she performed for a crowd of thousands.  The BRIT Award winner certainly seemed to be enjoying herself while belting out her catchy hits for the impressed audience Meanwhile, TLC - consisting of bandmembers Tionne 'T-Boz' Watkins and Rozonda 'Chilli' Thomas - took to the West Holts stage.

'Showers will ease into Friday night and the band of rain will continue north-eastwards bringing some heavy bursts of rain at times.' Tomorrow, the band of rain will weaken but showers will break out to the West and South West.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said this may be because the event has gone largely cashless and attendees are paying using their phones. As of 11am today, 11 offences had been recorded since the gates of Glastonbury opened early on Wednesday morning, ending a three-year hiatus for the Somerset festival. Those offences included four incidents of theft, four drug-related offences, one incident of common assault, one incident of criminal damage and one incident of public disorder. One of the drug-related offences resulted in an arrest. Ms Ayres said some 'could be locally heavy with a risk of local thunderstorms, especially in the south west, therefore risk of some heavy showers for Glastonbury.' Northern Ireland and parts of western Scotland could see some longer spells of rain, with heavy bursts, while the north and west could experience strong winds with a risk of coastal gales. For Sunday, Ms Ayres said: 'Cloudy with outbreaks of rain in the northwest, this becoming more showery later on. Elsewhere a mixture of sunny spells and scattered showers, some showers for Glastonbury into the afternoon, these heaviest in the south west.' Strong winds continue in the north and west with a risk of coastal gales, mainly Northern Ireland, Wales and western Scotland, while it will be breezy elsewhere. It comes as Billie Eilish will make history when she takes to the Pyramid Stage tonight as Glastonbury Festival's youngest ever solo headliner. The weather is set to be dry during her performance, despite the high chance of showers throughout the afternoon. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: 'It's going to be a fairly cloudy start to the morning.  'There is going to be a few showers around but on the light side generally, so a bit of a cloudy, damp start to the day but quite a warm start with temperatures around 16C (61F). It does look like it will get drier and brighter as the morning goes on. 'There will be a few glimmers of sunshine by the early afternoon but then it looks like into the early evening there is a band of rain that is coming from the west so around 4pm there will be some showery rain that will push eastwards across Glastonbury - but it should clear around about 7pm.

If we get any sunshine it will be around 19C (66F) but compared to yesterday's 24C (75F) it will be a cooler day.' President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has addressed the crowd at Glastonbury festival with a video message which was played on the big screens at the Other Stage today. He said: 'Greetings Glastonbury. The festival resumes this year after a two-year break, the pandemic has put on hold lives of the millions of people around the world, but has not broken. We in Ukraine would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace. 'But we will not let Russia's war break us, we want to stop the war before it ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America - they are all under threat now. That is why I turn to you for support Glastonbury the greatest concentration of freedom these days and I ask you to share this feeling with everyone who's freedom is under attack. 'Spread the truth about Russia's war, help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of the war, find our United24 charity platform and put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine. 'Time is priceless and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia's war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins! Slava Ukraine.' The message was played ahead of The Libertines stage-opening set. Grammy-winning singer Eilish, 20, will perform alongside her brother and co-writer, Finneas O'Connell. The US pop star made her Glastonbury debut in 2019 when she performed on the Other Stage and treated crowds to a string of tracks such as Bad Guy and You Should See Me In A Crown. In the weeks leading up to Glastonbury, Eilish has played a string of UK and European tour dates and also hosted a climate event, Overheated, at London's O2 Arena. She also topped the bill at Coachella in the US in April, bringing out guests Khalid and Damon Albarn for a set that thrilled fans and reviewers. Eilish's mother, Maggie Baird, said her daughter's history-making set at Glastonbury is 'definitely amazing but very hard to process at the same time'. Baird, an actor, screenwriter and former theatre troupe teacher, told The Guardian: 'It's a very pinch-me moment. People always ask 'How do you feel on this momentous day?' But, as a parent, everything your kid does from the beginning is kind of amazing. 'I was blown away when she was playing the little club in our tiny area of Highland Park (in Los Angeles). It just stays mind-blowing.' On the day Eilish headlines Glastonbury, Sir Paul McCartney will be warming up for his headline slot tomorrow by performing at a Somerset music venue. The surprise gig at the Cheese & Grain entertainment venue in Frome was announced yesterday, with 'first come, first served' tickets selling out in under an hour. Sir Paul will also make history as Glastonbury Festival's oldest ever solo headliner when he takes to the stage tomorrow. The festival will see the former Beatle return to top the Pyramid stage bill for the second time after a performance in 2004. It marks exactly a week after celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of music-making. The music offering this year will also feature Kendrick Lamar headlining on Sunday, with Diana Ross filling the Sunday Teatime Legends slot. Glastonbury co-organiser Emily Eavis said on Friday morning that the festival site is 'looking amazing' and 'so beautiful'.

There's 100,000 people here and it's just absolutely gorgeous. Seeing the valley full of tents and flags and people, it's exactly how it should be. It's a really good vibe down here.' Melanie C said it would be 'the dream' for the Spice Girls to play at Glastonbury next year, adding she has a 'good feeling' band member Victoria Beckham would join them. The 48-year-old singer, who played Spice Girl anthems Who Do You Think You Are and Spice Up Your Life during her Glastonbury DJ set at Williams Green stage yesterday evening, described the experience as 'insane'. Mel C plays a DJ set at the Williams Green Stage on day two of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm in Somerset last night She told BBC Breakfast: 'I didn't expect it to be as big as it was and as many people to be going as nuts as they did, it was a wonderful introduction to Glastonbury. 'It's amazing because the wonderful thing about Glastonbury is there is something for everyone, there is so many musical styles and when you drop a Spice Girls song you think: how is it going to go? But people loved it, it was wonderful.' The singer, known as Sporty Spice, wore an 'Alexa play Spice Girls' t-shirt during her DJ set. Talking about the Spice Girls playing at Glastonbury, she said: 'It's the dream, the absolute dream, we would love to do it. 'The girls and I, we have chatted about it, it's the biggest stage in the world, we have the best festival in the world right here.' She added she has a 'good feeling' that Beckham, known as Posh Spice, would join them for the gig.   Ms Eavis was speaking as day three of the musical festival dawned on Worthy Farm, where Eilish will make history. Apart from Eilish, the line-up for the Pyramid Stage on Friday includes Sam Fender, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Crowded House, Rufus Wainwright and Wolf Alice - whose appearance hangs in the balance. In the early hours of yesterday, the band tweeted to say they were stuck in Los Angeles because their flight had been cancelled. In the evening they told fans they were waiting for a 'flight to Seattle' where they could then go directly to London. Then this morning, Wolf Alice posted a video on their Instagram story which showed them on a plane, tagging Heathrow Airport, less than seven hours before their Glastonbury performance. Ziggy Marley is Friday's first performer of the day, on the Pyramid stage, starting at 12.15pm. Other acts performing today include the Sugababes on the Avalon Stage, and Foals and St Vincent on the Other Stage, which also features performances today from Kae Tempest and The Libertines. Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra will also mark their first performance in the UK since their win, with a performance of Shangri-La's Truth Stage on today's bill. Meanwhile the Pet Shop Boys said today that they will bring 'an element of theatre' to their headline performance at Glastonbury and will be 'pulling out all the stops' on the Other Stage on Sunday. The pop duo, comprising Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, told Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2 that the secret to having a career spanning four decades is 'still enjoying it'. Tennant said: 'Forty years ago we didn't really used to tour and now we really enjoy touring and we are looking forward to Glastonbury, the energy level keeps you going.' Lowe revealed he has a 'nap room' with a 'fully made inflatable bed' with the turn-around from being fully asleep to being on stage around 15 minutes. Speaking about their upcoming Glastonbury appearance, Tennant said: 'We always wanted to bring in an element of theatre, we have worked with a young designed called Tom Scutt, we met him three years ago and then we had the pandemic, and since then he has done the new production of Cabaret but people just look at you in a fresh way, so really you take on someone else's perspective of you and that helps to keep it fresh. 'We are pulling out all the stops for Glastonbury, there is going to be someone joining us for one song, it's actually pretty obvious who it is, it's quite exciting.' The duo also revealed they wrote two albums' worth of songs and a musical during lockdown, adapting the story by Hans Christian Andersen The Emperor's New Clothes 'into a Cabaret-type musical', Tennant added.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10952027/Glasto-three-years-Covid-tens-thousands-party-night-Worthy-Farm.html"},
{"title": "White House declares monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency: Cases continue to rise across America with more than 6,600 confirmed infections - overwhelmingly among gay and bisexual men", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter", "date": " 18:08, 4 August 2022 ", "text": "America's monkeypox outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Thursday afternoon after the nation's infection tally hit 6,617 cases. Its Secretary Xavier Becerra revealed the shift to an emergency status in a press conference, saying he was prepared to go 'to the next level' and urging every American to 'take monkeypox seriously'. The declaration will make more resources available for states, allow for federal officials being deployed nationwide and enhance data collection on cases, hospitalizations and testing. Cases have been surging by more than a hundred per day for three weeks now, with CDC director Rochelle Walensky admitting today officials were unsure whether this was due to the virus spreading quickly or older infections being picked up. She said the nation was only utlizing about 10 percent of its testing capacity — or 1,000 of 10,000 swabs per day —, and called for more swabs to be sent to labs. The federal declaration comes after New York, California and Illinois — which are facing the biggest outbreaks — all declared their own public health emergencies last week. The World Health Organization made declared an international public health emergency two weeks ago, after the virus was reported in 70 countries where it is not endemic. There is 'huge concern' that monkeypox — which is spread via physical contact — could reach more vulnerable groups after at least five cases have been recorded in children, who are more at risk of serious disease from the virus. Federal officials have been slammed for a delayed response to the virus so far, allowing it to potentially spread unrestricted for weeks before expanding access to testing and rolling out vaccines to the population. At current, the country can perform up to 80,000 monkeypox tests each week. The above map shows which states have recorded monkeypox cases as of yesterday afternoon. The outbreak is biggest in New York, California and Illinois The above shows state's ranked by monkeypox cases. Only Montana and Wyoming are yet to report an infection Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra made the announcement this afternoon. The conference was also attended by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which has been slammed for a slow response to the virus Declaring the emergency, Becerra said: 'In light of all of these developments and the evolving circumstances on the ground, I want to make an announcement today that i will be declaring a public health emergency on monkeypox. 'We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus and we urge every american to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus.' Federal officials were expected to make the move last week, amid alarm over the ever-rising tally of infections. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  : First cases are confirmed in children and a pregnant woman, who are more at risk from the virus. : America set to declare public health emergency over outbreak after its case tally becomes the highest in the world. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, admitted today that officials were not sure whether the outbreak was slowing down. She said: 'Two things are happening at once that I think account for the rise in cases that we are seeing. One is the more widely available testing, and two is potentially more infections that are actually happening as a result of infections that happened two or three weeks ago.  'It is hard to disentangle those right now, but we do expect cases to continue to rise as we get more access to testing people and have more access to testing people.' She said 51 jurisdictions — although the type was not specified — have agreed to share data so far, although she hoped the rest would soon be able to. She also called for more samples to be sent for tests, saying America is only using 10 percent of the 10,000 swabs it can do a day. Almost every case detected so far has been in gay or bisexual men, officials say, although there are growing concerns the outbreak will spread to other groups. To date five children have tested positive for the virus — two in California, two in Indiana and one traveling through Washington D.C. — who are believed to have caught the virus from 'household contacts'. A pregnant woman has also tested positive for the disease. Both groups are more at risk of serious illness if they contract monkeypox, health officials said, and there is 'huge concern' about them catching the disease. During the briefing, HHS chiefs also revealed they had now delivered 600,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine to states. There is no data available on how many people have been jabbed, becuase initially states were not required to report this to the CDC. Within a week of America's first case being detected in a middle aged man in Massachusetts who had recently returned from Canada in May, both New York and Florida also declared their first infections. Since then cases have continued to surge upwards and over the last three weeks rose by more than a hundred infections per day. The biggest rise was the more than 1,000 cases in 24 hours on July 27, but CDC officials said this was mostly down to 'historical' cases only just being reported from California. The disease has also now spread to all U.S. states except Montana and Wyoming — which are very rural — with New York being the national hotspot having registered more than 1,600 infections.

He also said there was 'huge concern' that it could spill over into other groups — like children and pregnant women — who are much more vulnerable to the disease. Asked about it spreading to more vulnerable groups, Hanage said this was a 'huge question' that was causing 'a great deal of concern'. 'It is unquestionably true that the virus can infect other groups,' he said, '[but] it is not clear how sustainable transmission is within those other groups.'  'The population as a whole remains at low risk, but [officials] are going to have to be watching extremely closely to start checking how much transmission can occur within the other networks. The CDC has been repeatedly blasted for its slow response to the outbreak, with it appearing to repeat many of the same mistakes as with Covid. It took weeks for the agency to ramp up testing, with barely a hundred a day being carried out at the beginning and doctors left faced with hours of paperwork just to get a swab approved to be sent to labs. But they have now signed on five commercial labs, increasing capacity from up to 1,000 to 10,000 tests that can be processed a day. Medics are also being encouraged to send swabs forward. There have also been problems accessing vaccines, with many states saying that they have received too few from the national stockpile. Thousands have been dished out to date, but most of the jabs available when the disease first struck have spent weeks stuck in Denmark while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed a factory inspection. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11081799/White-House-plans-declare-monkeypox-outbreak-state-emergency.html"},

Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. Matt Ford, from Los Angeles, is the first patient to come forward to talk about his monkeypox diagnosis. He is pictured above with three spots due to the virus on his face @jmatthiasford sry the sound was too appropriate  #monkeypox   #monkeypoxvirus   #monkeypoxoutbreak   #monkeypoxvaccine   #CDC   #WHO   #greenscreen   #fyp   #fypシ ♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. 'I think in total I counted 25 and there are also some in more sensitive areas which tend to be the most painful. They're so painful that I had to go to my doctor to get painkillers just to be able to sleep, like really f****** painful.'  Ford also began suffering flu-like symptoms in the early stages, ranging from a fever, chills, night sweat and a cough. He is now isolating at home with most symptoms having largely subsided, but will remain there until the spots have healed over and the scabs dropped off. When he first spotted symptoms on June 17, America's monkeypox cases had just crossed into triple figures. But many scientists warned this was likely an 'undercount' because the CDC was carrying out so few tests every day. The CDC was performing about 60 tests for monkeypox a day last week, leaving it unable to stay on top of the virus. But it has now sent more swabbing kits to private laboratories as it aims to ramp up testing to tens of thousands a day. Ford showed spots on his stomach (left) and arm (right). There were about 25 in total, he said, that had erupted all over his body Ford said he took painkillers because one of the spots around his 'underwear zone' triggered so much pain he couldn't sleep. Pictured above is his arm with monkeypox warning signs Slamming the CDC's tracking of the virus on BuzzFeed, Ford said: 'Many friends and acquaintances [have] reached out to say they either also had it or had been exposed. Matt Ford, pictured above before contracting  monkeypox. He says he lives in Los Angeles and New York City 'While it was reassuring to know I wasn't alone, it also made me worry that cases were being severely undercounted.' He added in a TikTok video: 'According to my doctor... the CDC is doing a really lackluster job of tracking how many cases there actually are. '[This is] due to a lack of testing, and generally not being on top of it.' Ford is America's first monkeypox patient to reveal his identity and be featured in a national publication. Describing his symptoms, he said: 'You can see these [spots] on my face, these are thankfully healing the fastest.  'And then these are on my arms and hands that you can see — they are really not cute. I have got one on my tummy here. And those are just a few of the ones on my body. Previous 1 Next             A day after being warned he had been exposed to the tropical disease, Ford said he began to experience flu-like symptoms which led to him visiting the doctors. Medics took a swab on the Monday, June 20, but did not manage to get him a diagnosis until the following Thursday, the 23rd — by which point he 'already knew' he was infected. A nurse then began to check-in on him daily via phone, and he also received an order to remain at home until all his symptoms subsided. America has now recorded 351 cases of monkeypox. But scientists fear there are many more infections in the country that are yet to be diagnosed Ford is pictured above showing spots that had appeared due to the disease on his face. He made a video for social media to reveal his diagnosis Medical literature says patients with monkeypox initially experience flu-like symptoms — such as a cough or fever — before the characteristic rash appears and spreads across the body. But in the current outbreak this is not what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recording. They say many patients are seeing rashes and spots emerge around the genital and anal areas as the first warning sign. This is then followed by flu-like symptoms and a rash that spreads to the rest of the body. Monkeypox is passed on from close skin-to-skin contact. In the current outbreak it is mostly being transmitted through sex where people come into contact with infectious lesions. But it is not a sexually transmitted disease, and can spread without any sexual activity. In rare incidents it can also spread through the air when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. Monkeypox kills up to 10 per cent of people it infects. However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. There are no specific treatments available for monkeypox infection. However, because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. The US is currently rolling out the Jynneous jab to gay men who regularly have sex with others in New York and Washington D.C. in order to curb its spread. Another patient, based in Chicago, has also come forward on social media with their diagnosis, but has chosen to remain anonymous — going by the pseudonym 'thatgaydoctor.'  Medical literature warns someone can transmit the monkeypox virus for as long as they have any signs. They can only be declared all clear when their spots have scabbed over and dropped off. Ford said he began taking frequent baths and painkillers to help ease pain from his spots, but that it was only 'so-so' at helping with it. Symptoms began to subside about a week after they appeared, he said, but he is now waiting for the final scabs to heal over. The CDC has faced repeated criticism for its testing regime, which many doctors warned initially discouraged medics from asking for the tests. The laborious process requires a patient's sample to first be tested for an orthopox virus — the family of viruses including monkeypox — at a local laboratory. If the result is positive, the sample is then sent to the CDC for confirmation. Critics say the process also requires clinicians to report suspected cases to health departments, who decide whether it meets the criteria to be checked for orthopox. It can also involve calling public hotlines and answering extensive questionnaires, which can be slow and cumbersome dissuading doctors from seeking tests. Health officials were carrying out about 10 swabs for monkeypox a day when the outbreak began, the  Washington Post  reported. This had risen to 60 a day by last week, but was still falling well short of the number needed as the outbreak continued to grow. America has recorded 351 monkeypox cases to date, with another 45 spotted over the last 24 hours. New York and California are facing the biggest outbreaks.  But experts fear this could be just the 'tip of the iceberg', with many more infections in the community going undetected.  Experts say that as the rash-causing virus is spreading under the radar it could well become an 'entrenched' sexually transmitted disease in the population because warning signs can be easily missed. Dr. Jay Varma, an epidemiologist at the Weill Cornell Medical School in  New York City , said early infection signs are 'innocuous' and in hard to see places — like the inside of the anus — raising the likelihood it is missed. This gives the rash-causing virus a window in which to transmit to others, before more serious signs like flu-like symptoms and rashes across the body appear.  Varma added that the tropical disease was also being aided by a lack of STI testing in the U.S., leaving many cases un-diagnosed.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10962529/Americas-monkeypox-patient-come-forward-actor-Los-Angeles.html"},

On Friday, United States cases of monkeypox topped 2,800 while globally that number surpassed more than 16,000.  While those most susceptible to are men who identify as gay or bisexual - about 99% of the current cases involve men who have sex with men - the diagnosis of two pediatric patients this week raised the level of concern that the virus may be targeting other populations,  MSN  reported.  'We're looking at ways in which the response could be enhanced by declaring a public health emergency,'  White House  COVID response coordinator, Ashish Jha, said Friday.

{"title": "How to have SEX with monkeypox: CDC releases bizarre guide telling patients to ‘keep their clothes on’ or ‘masturbate six feet from their partner’ if the urge arises while infected", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 21:34, 16 June 2022 ", "text": "The  CDC  has issued bizarre guidance telling Americans infected with  monkeypox  to have sex by masturbating at least six feet away from their partner, among other recommendations. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says anyone who has the disease must not have sex. But for those who ignore the advice, the agency has published a list of the dos and donts under the bedsheets. Among its tips was also to have sex while still fully-clothed, to ensure all rashes are covered and even to avoid kissing. Other advice was to wash hands, fetish gear and clothes immediately afterwards and even to consider having sex virtually such as over the phone.  People catch monkeypox by touching infectious skin lesions, but it can also be spread through the air during 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It can take up to four weeks for anyone infected with monkeypox to recover from the disease, with about eight days needed from infection for symptoms to appear.  Another 12 monkeypox cases were recorded in America Wednesday, in the biggest day-on-day rise since the outbreak began taking the total to 85 cases. Cases are currently told to isolate themselves or hospitalize, in an echo of the early Covid pandemic.  Globally, there are more than 2,000 across about 40 countries outside of West Africa. Previous 1 Next             Health chiefs in Canada and America have issued bizarre advice on how not to catch Covid or monkeypox while having sex. : New York City on how to not catch Covid during sex : Canadian health chiefs on avoiding catching Covid during sex. : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to avoid catching monkeypox from an infected person. The CDC published its guidance on having sex with monkeypox earlier this month on its page on 'social gatherings, safer sex, and monkeypox'.  'If you or a partner has monkeypox, the best way to protect yourself and others is to not have sex of any kind (oral, anal, vaginal) and not to kiss or touch each other's body's while you are sick, especially any rashes or sores,' it reads. '[But] if you or your partner have (or think you might have monkeypox) and you decide to have sex, consider the following to reduce the chance of spreading the virus.' The guidance carries echoes of Canadian health chiefs recommendation in the first year of the Covid pandemic that people use glory holes to have sex. The British Columbia Center for Disease Control said people should 'use barriers, like walls (e.g. glory holes), that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face contact.' A glory hole is a small opening cut into a wall that allows someone to have sex with as little skin-to-skin contact as possible. In 2020 New York City health chiefs also issued advice on how to have sex without catching Covid, telling residents to 'make it a little kinky'. In a three-page memo they told people to avoid casual sex, orgies, or sexual contact with anyone outside their household. But in cases where this was not possible they said people should 'be creative' and use 'physical barriers' like walls. Virtual sex in 'Zoom parties' were also recommended, as well as in chat rooms on the internet. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, with anyone at risk of catching it from others should they touch a rash or skin lesion. But the World Health Organization is currently looking into reports that the rash-causing virus may be spread through the semen. Italian and German scientists say they have detected fragments of the tropical disease in the semen of patients. It is currently unclear whether these pieces are infectious, and capable of causing the disease in another individual. But scientists at the Spallanzani Institute, in Rome, say at least one of their patients had enough fragments in their semen to suggest another person could be infected. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Medical literature suggests monkeypox patients typically experience a flu-like fever followed by a rash emerging on the face before spreading to the rest of the body three days later. But the CDC says in many cases spotted so far patients have skipped straight to suffering the rashes. They add that these are often localized around the penis and anus — and in some cases do not spread to other areas of the body. They would also change at different speeds, with some moving to puss-filled blisters while others still had fluid-filled ones. Medical literature suggests that generally all rashes should progress at the same speed to fluid and then puss-filled blisters. Most infections in the outbreak are being detected among gay or bisexual men and linked to international travel. But at least two have now been spotted among people who have not recently traveled and are not linked to a known infections, suggesting it is transmitting under the radar. Scientists have already raised concerns that monkeypox is likely traveling undetected in some parts of the country. Most infections are mild, and clear up on their own within four weeks. But one in 100 can prove fatal, estimates suggest.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10923921/How-SEX-monkeypox-Bizarre-CDC-guide-revealed.html"},

While 50,000 vaccine doses are on order, public health experts say four times this number will be needed to halt the spread. In the UK, there have already been more than 1,850 cases of the disease, which causes painful blisters across the body, and numbers are believed to be doubling every 15 days. These have predominantly been seen in gay men. Dr Deborah Birx, the former head of the US Covid task force, told The Mail on Sunday that all gay men in  London  under the age of 50 should be vaccinated as well as women who visit gay bars. 'If you're at a gay bar and you're dancing, then there is a risk of infection,' she said. Monkeypox cases could spiral by the end of the year – and reach children, for whom the virus can be deadly – if efforts to vaccinate against it are not improved, experts have warned The virus is passed on through close physical contact, such as sex, but also kissing and hugging. Vaccines can provide effective protection, but doctors have criticised the slow rollout of the jabs to Britons most at risk and claim the UK does not have not enough doses to stop the virus from spreading into the wider population. There are particular worries that monkeypox could reach children, who are more likely to suffer severe illness as a result. On Thursday, the UK Health Security Agency confirmed that a London school sent reception classes home until the end of term after a child came into contact with a monkeypox case. According to a letter sent to parents, officials advised parents to avoid hugging their children, or any other very close contact, for two weeks. The children will now be offered the vaccine. Dr Deborah Birx (pictured), the former head of the US Covid task force, told The Mail on Sunday that all gay men in London under the age of 50 should be vaccinated as well as women who visit gay bars. 'If you're at a gay bar and you're dancing, then there is a risk of infection,' she said There are two vaccines that can protect against the virus. One, created by a small Danish company, specifically protects against monkeypox. But the decades-old smallpox vaccine also works, because the two viruses are so similar. The majority of over-50s are thought already to have good immunity to monkeypox because they would have received a compulsory smallpox jab in the 1970s and 1980s. The Mail on Sunday understands the UK has 30,000 vaccines – a combination of the two types – and sexual health clinics last week began inviting some gay men to receive the jab. Previous 1 2 Next                   However, experts say at least 200,000 doses of the jab are needed to prevent monkeypox spreading and reaching children, and spreading among them and other vulnerable groups such as pregnant women.  This figure is based on the number of men eligible for HIV-preventative drugs – those who have on average two or more male partners every six months, and as such are at most risk of catching monkeypox. If health officials are able to vaccinate this group, experts believe the disease could be effectively controlled. Examples of the monkeypox rash, which can appear anywhere on the body. In the UK, there have already been more than 1,850 cases of the disease, which causes painful blisters, and numbers are believed to be doubling every 15 days. These have predominantly been seen in gay men Official estimates suggest there are 100,000 men eligible for these drugs in the UK, 70,000 of whom are in London, where the majority of monkeypox cases have already been seen. As with Covid, two jabs are required for the vaccine to have full effect, meaning that, at present, the UK cannot vaccinate all eligible Britons. 'Health officials have told us the current strategy is to get hold of 50,000 doses of the vaccine, but since we need to give out two doses, that means only 25,000 people will get them and that's not nearly enough,' says Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV.  'Currently monkeypox is just affecting this sub-group of Britons, but if cases keep rising it won't stay that way. When it eventually breaks out into the wider population, we'll need a lot more vaccines than we can feasibly get our hands on.' Experts also believe there are many cases going undiagnosed, following a study last week from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium, which showed transmission of the virus may occur without symptoms. More than ten per cent of Britons infected have been hospitalised, though this has predominantly been for pain management, as the blisters can be debilitating, making activities such as eating and going to the toilet excruciating. In people with weaker immune systems, like children, the disease can be deadly. In June, World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was concerned that sustained transmission of monkeypox would lead to the virus establishing itself in the community and could infect 'high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women'.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11020005/Monkeypox-infect-children-end-year.html"},

{"title": "UK's monkeypox outbreak tops 500 cases as health chiefs reveal another 52 Brits have caught rash-causing virus", "author": "John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 13:39, 15 June 2022 ", "text": "Britain's monkeypox outbreak passed 500 cases today, with another 52 patients sickened with the tropical virus. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses say 'most' new infections are still among gay and bisexual men. England has recorded 504 cases, Scotland 13, Wales five and  Northern Ireland  two.   Health chiefs are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, which is usually only seen in Africa amid fears it could become endemic in Europe. Dozens of countries around the world, including the US,  Spain  and Portugal, have all been affected with around 1,800 confirmed global cases.  The growing tally comes as Pride event organisers said monkeypox must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ celebrations.  It also comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) promised to rename the rash-inducing infection following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term.  Previous 1 Next                         Global Pride events are an opportunity to spread public health messages about monkeypox and must not be cancelled, an expert has told a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing. Steve Taylor, board member at EuroPride, said the virus – which has been mainly concentrated in gay and bisexual men – must not be used as an excuse to shut down LGBTQ+ events. Mr Taylor told the briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. 'We have been working with WHO over recent weeks to develop our messages and we will encourage Pride organisations and event producers across Europe to use their events to raise awareness of the facts about monkeypox so that people can protect themselves. 'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, was asked why cases have been predominantly in the men who have sex with men. She said: 'All outbreaks start somewhere… this virus doesn’t choose any one person against another, it’s opportunistic in its spread. 'And how it will spread will really be defined by the opportunities it has. 'It’s also a disease that has an incubation period of 21 days. We’re just over a month into this outbreak, understanding that outbreak, so it’s too early to conclude as to how it will be spreading amongst the general population.' The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work.  A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The UKHSA this month declared the virus a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles. Britain's latest figures come as two more countries joined global tally of nations in reporting cases of the disease. It comes as Steve Taylor, board member at LGBTQ+ event EuroPride, said monkeypox must not be used as an excuse to shut down pride events. Mr Taylor told a WHO briefing that this summer Europe will host around 750 Pride events. 'We are reassured by the clear statement from WHO that major events including Pride should not be cancelled or curtailed because of the outbreak,' he said. He added that such events could also be used to spread public health messaging about monkeypox so people can keep an eye out for possible symptoms and protect themselves.  Mr Taylor also warned that people who hated the LGBTQ+ could use monkeypox fears as a weapon in an attempt to stop pride events from going ahead.  'Sadly, but entirely predictably, some of those who oppose Pride and who oppose equality and human rights have already been attempting to use monkeypox as a justification for calls for Pride to be banned. 'We are pleased that the WHO guidance is clear that Pride and major events should not be affected and are, in fact, opportunities to share important public health messaging.' The latest UK monkeypox figures come as the WHO confirmed it is looking to rename the disease following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term for monkeypox. WHO chiefs promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, confirmed the move. He said: '[The] WHO is working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades, and the disease it causes. World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed they are in conversation with experts on changing the name for monkeypox Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic A group of scientists from around the world have said the current naming of monkeypox and its clades (different types of the virus) is inaccurate, discriminatory and stigmatising. They say references to West African and Central African monkeypox do not accurately reflect the current monkeypox outbreak sweeping the world. Instead, they suggest ditching terms tied to geography, a move the World Health Organization (WHO) has broadly supported. The scientists have suggested monkeypox in general should now be renamed to MPXV. A number at the end of MPXV would indicate the particular clade of the virus. MPXV1 would indicate Central African monkeypox. MPXV2 for the West African version. And MPXV3 would be term for an offshoot of the West African responsible for pervious and current international outbreaks. But the the scientists add the current outbreak and its sustained human-to-human transmission deserves its own clade.  This would be called hMPXV with letters indicating distinct genetic lineages. With pervious international human-to-human monkeypox outbreaks in 2017-2019 with their own distinct ancestry this would mean the current outbreak would be called hMPXVB.1. While the WHO has said it supports renaming monkeypox, the formal naming of viruses is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses. This international committee of virologists would need to accept any new name for monkeypox for it to become official.   'We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.' Monkeypox's naming system currently divides it into two types, the West African version and Central African or Congo Basin version. But experts want them to be replaced with numbers, like MPXV1, MPXV2 and so forth. Naming viruses geographically goes against WHO guidelines because of concerns it may spark abusive backlash or potential racism. It is, for this reason, that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) was not called the Wuhan coronavirus, despite originating in the Chinese city of the same name. Writing in a paper published last week, the coalition of infectious disease researchers from around the world also proposed creating a new 'clade' for the current outbreak. They argue the virus circulating at present has become a distinct 'human virus', compared to MPXV, which rarely transmitted between people. The new type, the experts claimed, should be called hMPXV and lineages should be referred to as A, A.1, A.1.1, B.1. They gave four examples because of data showing the West African strain has evolved slightly, based on samples collected in small human-to-human outbreaks over the past few years. The naming system would be similar system to that used for Covid variants like Omicron, with Britain hit by a wave of BA.2 and now experiencing an uptick in cases of BA.4 and BA.5. One benefit of ditching geographic terms would be encouraging countries to continue monitoring for and raising the alarm when spotting new diseases, rather than having their name negatively attached to it, the scientists said. The responsibility of renaming monkeypox actually lies with the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a committee tasked with formally labelling pathogens. It is not the first time concerns about monkeypox and racism have been raised. Last month the Foreign Press Association, Africa, a media body for journalists on the continent, urged Western media to stop using photos of black people alongside monkeypox stories describing the outbreak in Europe and North America. They accused such outlets of perpetuating 'negative stereotypes that assigns calamity to the African race and privilege of immunity to other races.'  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  Calls to rename monkeypox because of concerns of racism and discrimination echo those regarding some people calling Covid the 'Chinese virus' such as former US President Donald Trump (pictured here at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting last month) Mr Trump was widely condemned over statements referring to Covid as the 'Chinese violence' with some studies finding it increased anti-Asian comments on social media  They instead urged reports on monkeypox to instead use images of hospitals in their own countries or of graphical representations of the virus itself. Calls to rename monkeypox echo those made regarding Covid after people, such as former US President Donald Trump, started referring to it as the China or Wuhan virus in 2020, shortly after the virus began spreading internationally.  The current term monkeypox is already somewhat misleading as while the virus was first discovered in macaques, many cases are believed to be transmitted to humans by rodents. A large proportion of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections. With milder strains, the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. Dr Ghebreyesus said that 1,600 confirmed monkeypox cases and 1,500 suspected cases have been reported to the WHO this year from 39 countries, 32 of which have been recently hit by the virus.  But other experts tracking the outbreak say at least 40 nations have logged cases or suspected cases.  While 72 deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox was already endemic, none have been seen in the newly affected countries, Dr Tedros said. However, he added that the WHO is seeking to verify news reports from Brazil of a monkeypox-related death there. The UN agency will hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid. Officials are scrambling to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe too unless it is stamped out soon. Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.  As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues. The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 40 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. The most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Canada and Germany. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10919427/UKs-monkeypox-outbreak-tops-500-cases-52-Brits-having-caught-rash-causing-virus.html"},

The new cases marked the biggest day-on-day rise since the outbreak began a month ago, and the first time daily cases have breached double digits. Nevada  became the eighteenth state to detect the rash-causing virus, with a man in his 20s who had recently traveled to another part of the United States testing positive for the virus. Scientists are already warning that the tropical disease may be spreading undetected in some areas, and that patients are not suffering typical symptoms. In an update the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said some patients were facing pain or bleeding around the anus, not previously associated with the illness. Many were also suffering fluid and pus-filled blisters at the same time, whereas previously these would not appear at the same time. It comes after Chicago yesterday became the first city to warn people who 'feel ill' or have rashes to avoid summer festivals to limit the risk of spreading the virus. More than 2,000 cases have been reported across 40 countries — mostly in Europe — outside the native West Africa in the current outbreak. In today's dashboard update, Florida reported the biggest rise in infections after detecting another four — taking its tally to nine. Two were spotted in Chicago and Massachusetts respectively. One case each was also detected in California, Nevada, New York City and Washington D.C. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will investigate whether monkeypox can be passed on through semen. Currently, scientists say it may spread through sex due to physical contact with infectious skin lesions on the genital area or other parts of the body. But this week Italian scientists said they had detected fragments of the virus in semen — raising the possibility it could transmit through this route. German scientists say they have also detected the virus in semen. A WHO official revealed they were looking into the reports Wednesday. The agency's monkeypox incident manager Catherine Smallwood said:  New York City currently has the biggest outbreak in the country with 16 cases, according to local officials. Sullivan County, in upstate New York, has reported a presumptive case as well. Official CDC figures list the Empire state at 16 cases.  California is tied for the most infections, also at 16. Concerns were raised this week that monkeypox was spreading undetected in Massachusetts after two cases were spotted with no links to international travel or its first infection from last month. Today another two cases were spotted in men, although health chiefs did not say whether they were close contacts of another case or had recently traveled. Earlier this week Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the state's Harvard University, said infections earlier this week 'certainly indicate undetected transmission chains'. He added: 'I noticed that [health officials in the state] have urged \"vigilance\". I think it is extremely appropriate.' Florida and Chicago are yet to release any additional details about their new cases of monkeypox. But earlier this week Chicago's health officials said people who 'feel sick' or 'have rashes' should not attend summer parties or festivals in case they have monkeypox. It said the guidance was issued to allow residents to make 'informed choices' about where they are mixing with others. Medical literature suggests monkeypox patients experience a fever within the first 21 days of being infected, followed by a rash that covers the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But in an update on Tuesday the CDC said many patients it was recording were not experiencing the typical symptoms. It said many were developing the rashes before fevers, with some never experiencing a fever at all. Skin lesions could also appear all over the body and progress at different times, whereas medical literature suggests rashes would gradually transition to fluid-filled and then puss-filled blisters at the same time. Rashes were also being recorded in the mouth and genital area or anus, which has not previously been associated with the illness. Most cases are among gay and bisexual men and linked to international travel, health chiefs have said. But at least two have now been detected in people with no links to international travel or another known case, suggesting the virus is spreading under the radar in the United States. But CDC chiefs have so far brushed off these cases, saying they are likely contacts of people who returned from international travel but were not diagnosed. It says they are yet to record any urban outbreaks of the tropical disease similar to those being registered in Europe. It comes as the World Health Organization says it will rename monkeypox with a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely also be lettered such as A or B to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted.

{"title": "Experts slam US response to monkeypox as a 'failure' because public health officials and bureaucrats did not ramp up testing or acquire vaccines in time to control virus: America's infection tally reaches 866", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 16:00, 12 July 2022 ", "text": "The United States' response to the budding  monkeypox  outbreak is being slammed by health experts - blaming officials for being asleep at the wheel and failing to learn lessons from failures early during the  COVID-19  pandemic. The tropical virus has been detected 866 times in the U.S. according to more recent data from the  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention - but there is near-universal agreement among experts that the figure is a severe undercount. Monkeypox has been allowed to spread undetected because of failures in America's testing and surveillance infrastructure - similar to how Covid was allowed to spread so widely early on when it caught the world off guard in early 2020. Unlike Covid, though, monkeypox is not novel, leaving experts frustrated with how top officials failed to deal with a threat they were already knowledgeable to.  Previous 1 Next             'Why is it so hard for something that's even a known pathogen?' Dr Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA said to the New York Times. 'How many more times do we have to go through this?'  America's monkeypox response has been marred by a fractured and limited testing system and limited access to vaccines that could help Americans get ahead of infection. Dozens of people lined up for vaccines against monkeypox in New York City Friday as the city launched its second jabbing drive. The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. At a press briefing last week the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan.  This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. At first, when a person was feeling symptoms of the virus they would be tested locally for the orthopox family of viruses. If positive, their sample would need to be sent to the CDC for confirmation - a process that could take days. This meant that even working as fast as possible, case figures in the U.S. were always going to be days behind. Some of those testing gaps have since been filled, with the CDC announcing in recent days that both Labcorp and the Mayo Clinic had been enlisted in expanding testing capacity. Still, though, access to monkeypox testing is extremely limited and sparse in a nation of over 330 million people. 'It's pretty clear that we need to rapidly scale up the ability to diagnose this now,' said Dr Jay Varma, a Cornell University public health expert who advised the New York City's mayor's office during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some experts are comparing this shortage of testing to where America was early on in the Covid pandemic. One significant difference is that the scientific community had no idea what Covid was when it fist emerged, and how to diagnose it was still unclear. With a virus like monkeypox, which is endemic in some parts of the world and occasionally pops up in the United States, experts believe the same mistakes should not have been repeated again. 'We clearly identified this as a major mistake that allowed Covid to get its footprint in the U.S. and spread undetected for a month, without any of us knowing... and now we're just doing the same thing all over again, because that's the way it's done,' Dr Angela Rasmussen, a public health expert at Canada's University of Saskatchewan told the Times. The rolling out of vaccines has been spotty as well. American officials are believed to have around 800,000 doses of the two-shot Jynneos vaccine - a figure that may not be nearly enough. When vaccines have become available, supply has not been able to meet demand. In New York City - the nation's virus hotspot - walk-in events to receive the jabs often reach maximum demand within minutes of opening. These failures to properly track and prevent spread of the virus has many experts fearing that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., as it has in parts of West and Central Africa.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11006127/Experts-response-monkeypox-failure.html"},

It is being offered to men aged 18 and over who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners over the last 14 days. More than 100 people queued up for the jab today at Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic, Manhattan, as it opened at 11am. Within three hours the city was forced to suspend walk-in appointments because of demand. The clinic now has all its appointments booked until Monday, with health officials saying they hope to make more slots available 'soon'.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' It was designed to fight smallpox, but health officials say it can also work against monkeypox because the two viruses are similar. After running out of slots today, the Department said: 'We hope to make more appointments available soon. 'We are in talks with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain more doses and are looking into how we can boost our capacity citywide.' New York is one of the first city's in America to start rolling out monkeypox vaccines more widely. The city — along with others including San Francisco — had already been offering the jabs to close contacts of confirmed monkeypox cases. Announcing the roll-out today, mayor Eric Adams said: 'As I have said since day one, we are prepared, not panicked and this monkeypox vaccination site is one more critical tool to keep New Yorkers healthy. 'Starting today, eligible New Yorkers who may have been exposed to monkeypox can now get vaccinated to stay safe and slow the spread.' America has now spotted a total of 156 cases of the virus nationwide in almost half of its states. But experts fear many more cases are currently going undetected because they have been mistaken for other diseases or due to problems accessing testing. New York City has the biggest outbreak out of any metropolis nationwide. At a state level California has the biggest outbreak with 40 cases, followed by the state of New York and Illinois with 19. The Biden administration today announced it was rolling out swabs for the disease to commercial laboratories in an attempt to speed up diagnosis and control measures. It comes as America gears up for yet more Pride celebrations this weekend across major cities. Chicago health officials have said they will put a 'special emphasis' on Pride in their warnings this weekend, and have printed off fliers to be handed out at events on protecting yourselves against monkeypox. San Francisco has also said it will be making 'public service announcements' during Pride in the city — expected to draw crowds of more than 500,000 — to remind people to stay safe. Most people who catch monkeypox suffer a mild infection that clears up within four weeks. But statistics suggest about one in 100 people who are infected face a serious illness that results in their death. The disease is primarily transmitted through physical contact with infectious skin lesions, or through touching clothes and bedding that came into contact with a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transferred through 'sustained' face-to-face contact the CDC says. Infected people are tending to experience rashes around the genital and anal areas as a first symptom, before the rash spreads to the rest of the body. They may also face flu-like symptoms.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10947255/New-York-City-places-nation-offer-monkeypox-vaccinations-public.html"},
{"title": "White House scrambles to ship new monkeypox vaccine to clinics across the country after critics claimed America ALREADY HAS a million doses but Biden 'can't figure out how to get them out of freezers in Denmark'", "author": "Keith Griffith For Dailymail.com", "date": " 04:33, 29 June 2022 ", "text": "The Biden administration is ramping up efforts to slow the spread of  monkeypox  by distributing tens of thousands of vaccine doses, after facing criticism over its early response to a US outbreak primarily affecting gay men.  The plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine - which has so far been limited - to prevent monkeypox in areas with the highest transmission and need.  The announcement came just hours after advocates sent a  letter  to the  White House  slamming the administration's monkeypox response, saying that 1 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine already owned by the US are stuck in limbo in Denmark awaiting a facility inspection.  Although the vaccine itself has been approved for use by US regulators, the doses in Denmark were produced on a manufacturing line that is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval, officials said earlier this month.   The letter from PrEP4ALL and Partners for Health said in part: 'We must not allow the same failures of vaccine production and distribution that hampered the global COVID-19 response cause us to fail to contain the current monkeypox outbreak.' 'If this is a test run for pandemic preparedness, we are flunking,' PrEP4ALL co-founder James Krellenstein told the  Washington Post . 'We have more than a million doses of a vaccine FDA approved for preventing monkeypox,' he said. 'And the U.S. government cannot figure out how to get it out of freezers in Denmark — doses that it owns — when there's uncontained spread in the gay community.'  Lines form at a New York monkeypox vaccine clinic last week, which quickly ran out of the 1,000 Jynneos doses that were offered to men at high risk The White House plan, announced on Tuesday, involves rapidly expanding access to doses of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine - which has so far been limited The Biden administration's new plan will immediately allocate 56,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories, with 1.6 million doses made available by the end of the year, officials said.  State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions' older ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but which has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised.  Previous 1 Next             The United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000 in its stockpiles, officials said earlier this month, but the vaccine is not recommended for those with HIV.  The United States has officially recorded 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions -- but health officials fear that the true count could be higher.  Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread.  The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days Workers sit outside of D.C. Health's first monkeypox vaccination clinic, which is administering the first Jynneos vaccine doses distributed in the U.S. capital on Tuesday Even after Tuesday's announcement, some advocates expressed concerns that vaccines would not get to those who need them the most, including men who have sex with other men, a group at higher risk. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told the Post   that the latest announcement was a 'confusing mess' that did not explain the formula for distributing vaccines. 'There are profound questions of how they will allocate limited vaccines to which jurisdictions, and states and local communities need a coordinated federal plan,' Harvey told the outlet.  'We need to reach people who are at risk for monkeypox and conduct widespread vaccine efforts for gay people and other men who have sex with men.' The White House said in a statement that the vaccine doses will be distributed to 'areas with the highest transmission and need, using a tiered allocation system.' 'As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk for monkeypox have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials have been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox.  Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic  The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Jennifer McQuiston, Deputy Director of CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and gay men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading. The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. 'It's almost like we're expanding the definition of who a contact might be,' said McQuiston. If people have been to a party or other place where monkeypox has been known to spread 'we recommend they come in for a vaccine,' she said.  The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.  There have been no U.S. deaths and officials say the risk to the American public is low. But they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem. One of the steps was to expand who is recommended to get vaccinated. Vaccines customarily are given to build immunity in people before they are ever infected.  But if given within days or even a few weeks of first becoming infected, some vaccines can reduce severity of symptoms. A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, is approved for monkeypox in the U.S. The government has many more doses of an older smallpox vaccine - ACAM2000 - that they say could also be used, but that vaccine is considered to have a greater risk of side effects and is not recommended for people who have HIV.  So it's the Jynneos vaccine that officials have been trying to use as a primary weapon against the monkeypox outbreak. So far, the government has deployed over 9,000 doses of vaccine. Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic to offer the vaccine to all gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the previous two weeks. But all the appointments quickly filled up that day, and the last round of appointments was Monday.  'Until we receive more supply we are unable to release additional vaccination appointments,' said Patrick Gallahue, a spokesman for the city's health department, in an email. On Monday, the District of Columbia´s health department took a similar step. The department started taking appointments at 1pm Monday but had to stop after 20 minutes, Mangla said. The department only had 200 doses of Jynneos, and it was clear at the point that it the department didn't have the vaccine supply or staffing to continue to sign up new people, he said.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10963519/White-House-scrambles-ship-tens-thousands-monkeypox-vaccine-doses.html"},
{"title": "UK spots another 50 monkeypox cases as outbreak continues to grow", "author": "Joe Davies Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 16:34, 17 June 2022 ", "text": "Another 50 monkeypox cases have been recorded in Britain.  Health chiefs said 46 of the new infections were in England, with three more in Scotland and one in Wales.  The UK has now logged 574 cases over the past six weeks, mainly in gay and bisexual men. It is the biggest outbreak outside of Africa to date.  Authorities are desperately to contain the tropical virus, amid fears it could become endemic in Europe. Dozens of countries have been hit by the current outbreak, including the US, Spain and Portugal. No deaths have been confirmed yet.  Officials warned people to be wary of symptoms — including tell-tale rashes or blisters — especially ahead of summer festivals and events. Previous 1 Next                         Monkeypox will be renamed following calls for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term, it has emerged. The World Health Organization (WHO) promised a new name for the rash-causing virus, endemic to Africa, would be announced 'as soon as possible'. As well as renaming the actual pathogen itself, strains will likely be lettered, such as A or B, to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. Over 30 researchers last week signed a position paper stating there was an 'urgent need' to change its name given the current outbreak, which has mainly struck gay and bisexual men.  It has already swept the world to strike 45 countries, including Britain, the US, Spain and Portugal. They wrote: 'Continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.' Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has confirmed the virus will be renamed. Dr William Welfare, incident director at UKHSA, said: 'As case numbers of monkeypox continue to rise and with many summer events and festivals ahead, we're reminding people to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox. 'Particularly if you've recently had new or multiple sexual partners, to help prevent further spread and protect others. 'If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don't go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact.' 'Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you've been seen by a clinician. UKHSA bosses are trying to raise public awareness of monkeypox 'so everyone has a safe, happy and healthy summer'. As part of efforts to thwart the outbreak, all confirmed cases and their close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is thought to be around 85 per cent effective at stopping infections. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. Authorities have yet to widen out the vaccination strategy but leading scientists have suggested the next step could involve a targeted rollout to gay and bisexual men.  People who test positive are advised to isolate for 21 days, which his how long it can take for symptoms to fade. They can leave isolation early if their scabs dry and fall off. Patients are advised to wear condoms for eight weeks post-infection.  The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks.  Officials said they have linked the outbreak back to 'gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad'. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.  It can also be spread through touching contaminated clothing, bedding or towels. The disease, which is similar to smallpox, is usually mild but kills up to 10 per cent of patients.  Current outbreaks are being driven by the least severe strain detected, which has a fatality rate closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. World Health Organization chiefs are going to change the name of the rash-causing virus, it was announced this week. It followed calls from a coalition of scientists for a new 'non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising' term. As well as renaming the actual virus itself, strains will likely be lettered to remove any mention of the parts of Africa where they were first spotted. The WHO will also hold an emergency meeting next week to determine whether to classify the global outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.  Only six PHEICs have been declared in the past, with the most recent being Covid.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10927751/UK-spots-50-monkeypox-cases-outbreak-continues-grow.html"},
{"title": "Experts warn that monkeypox patients in current outbreak may not have typical symptoms like fatigue and fever - making infection harder to spot in some cases: US infection tally reaches 560", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 16:30, 6 July 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  patients that are being infected as part of the current worldwide outbreak may not be exhibiting all of the typical symptoms of the virus, allowing some cases to go undetected, experts fear. A Belgian study released in pre-print on Tuesday found that some patients who had tested positive for the virus right at the start of the outbreak. It comes a week after a UK study found that many patients in the current outbreak were not experiencing fatigue or a fever - often telltale signs of infection. While this is a signal the strain of monkeypox circulating around the world is likely more mild than previous versions of the virus, it also allows for it to more easily circulate undetected. The findings have some officials alarmed as concerns that the tropical virus will become endemic outside of Africa are raised. In the U.S., 560 cases have been detected so far as part of the outbreak though real figures are likely higher because of poor surveillance in America. Previous 1 Next             In the UK study, published Friday in  The Lancet , 54 men who have sex with other men were inspected for potential monkeypox infection. None had any recent travel history to a nation where the virus is endemic or any known exposure to the virus. All also had at least one new sexual partner in the last three weeks. 'The commonly observed symptom of skin lesions in the anal and penile areas, and the fact that a quarter of the patients tested positive for gonorrhoea or chlamydia at the same time as the monkeypox infection, suggests that transmission of the monkeypox virus in this cohort is occurring from close skin-to-skin, for example in the context of sexual activity,' Dr Ruth Byrne, of the NHS, said in a release. The lesions were the primary symptoms experienced by the men, though, with reports of the usual fever and fatigue being limited. A Belgian study, that it still pending peer-review before official publication, made similar findings. Three men tested positive for the virus despite experiencing no symptoms and having no known contact with an infected person. This likely means they picked up the virus from someone else that was asymptomatic, and had they not found out of their own infection, could have continued to spread it to others. 'The existence of asymptomatic monkeypox infection indicates that the virus might be transmitted to close contacts in the absence of symptoms,' researchers wrote. 'Our findings suggest that identification and isolation of symptomatic individuals may not suffice to contain the outbreak,'  This undetected spread is the worst fear of health officials around the world.  Experts are warning that in the U.S. in particular, the undetected spread is also occurring because of how poorly federal officials have expanded access to testing and vaccines.  'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told  The Hill . 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. Testing for the virus has been a slow and arduous process so far. When a patient begins exhibiting symptoms of the virus they are first examined for the orthopox family of viruses. The lineage includes monkeypox - along with the extinct smallpox virus - and it is likely that anyone who tests positive for it does have the tropical infection. In order to confirm a monkeypox case, samples must be sent to the CDC for testing, where it is then confirmed. Testing is slow, though. Access to these test is limited as well. This makes many experts fear that cases are going undetected. The federal government has taken steps to expand capacity but access to tests is still relatively limited. On Wednesday, the CDC announced that it had partnered with Labcorp to expand testing, doubling the capacity of testing to 20,000 per week in the near future. There have also been cases detected so far with no links to international travel or to another case of the virus - meaning there is some undetected circulation of the virus ongoing. 'We've been sort of screaming for a month about how bad the diagnostic situation is for monkeypox,' James Krellenstein, cofounder of Prep4All, told The Hill. 'And that really was a clear error, preventable, and it's very clear that this administration has not learned lessons from early Covid.' The nation's vaccine rollout has been under intense scrutiny as well. American officials have ordered around 4.4 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine - including an additional 2.5 million last week. Getting the shots into arms has been a challenge, though. New York City had its first public vaccine event two weeks ago - ahead of Pride festivities in the Big Apple - but demand for the jabs was so high officials had to cut off walk-in appointments in a matter of hours. People waiting at the clinic for the shot told DailyMail.com that the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million. Other eager recipients accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Some experts are comparing the currently broken response to monkeypox to that of COVID-19 when it first erupted in March 2020. 'I think we'll continue to repeat these mistakes because that's been our track record. That's been our track record,' Jon Andrus, a global health professor at GW, said. 'We've had, what, more than five or six waves of Covid, and we seem every time to be a little bit caught off guard,... stopping transmission requires that we're all reading from the same page. We all have the same road map.'", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10987997/Monkeypox-patients-not-typical-symptoms-making-infection-harder-spot.html"},

The warning comes after a month of Pride celebrations in the city that included Pride in the Park on June 11, a concert that attracted over 20,000 people and included a performance from Christina Aguilera as well as the city's parade which occurred on June 12. According to  the Los Angeles Times,  thousands of people lined the city's streets to celebrate the return of the parade following a two-year hiatus due to  Covid-19 .   As of June 2, there were just three cases of monkeypox in all of California,  NBC News  said at the time.  There are now 51 reported monkeypox cases in California and 199 cases nationwide, according to the CDC.  LA is now offering the JYNNEOS vaccine to 'individuals at a higher risk of monkeypox.'  JYNNEOS is a vaccine used to treat smallpox and monkeypox that was first approved for use in the US by the Federal Drug Administration in 2019.  New York City began a rollout of the vaccine in preparation for their Pride celebrations this past Thursday. There are 35 reported cases in New York state.   Most early cases in the US were in people who had just returned from traveling abroad. But the disease has spread quickly, especially among gay men.  Worldwide, health officials have already warned that there is a spike in monkeypox cases in male gay and bisexual communities.  Monkeypox — native to West Africa — has now been detected more than 3,000 times across 40 countries where it is not typically found this year.  The above map shows the spread of monkeypox across the U.S. The virus has now been detected in 24 states. Previously, New York was the epicenter of the outbreak but it has now been surpassed by California Revelers in Los Angeles enjoying the Pride parade earlier in June 2022. Following the celebration, health officials warned that recent cases in the city 'identified have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men who attended large events' Similar to New York City, the city of Los Angeles is offering the JYNNEOS vaccine to 'individuals at a higher risk of monkeypox' The theme of Los Angeles' Pride parade this year was 'Love Your Pride' The tropical disease is primarily spread through physical contact with infectious rashes, but in rare cases it can also be transmitted through 'sustained' face-to-face contact. Many patients have rashes on their genital area and anus as a first warning sign, before the disease spreads to the rest of the body. It can take up to four weeks to get better from the disease, with most cases being mild and clearing up on their own. Someone remains infectious until their rashes have scabbed over and eventually fallen off. Previous 1 Next             In May 2022, Andy Seale, a strategies adviser with the World Health Organization, was  quoted  as saying that it's important for people to celebrate Pride events as normal. He said: 'It's important that people who want to go out and celebrate gay pride, LGBTQ+ pride, to continue to go and plan to so.'  Seale also said: 'Given that this is not a gay disease, the transmission routes are common to everybody. The advice is pretty much the same for all people.'  Also in May 2022, Dr. David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO's emergencies department, told The Associated Press that the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission at raves held in Spain and Belgium.  'We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission,' said Heymann.  Monkeypox does not spread easily from person-to-person and requires the exchange of bodily fluids or prolonged exposure to someone who already has the virus There have been no deaths recorded amid the 2022 outbreak of monkeypox in Europe and the US Just a few days before Pride events kicked off in New York City, 'at risk' gay and bisexual men were offered the vaccine This week, WHO stopped short of declaring Monkeypox a global health emergency but did say that the situation would be reviewed again next month.   The Biden administration has started shipping monkeypox tests to commercial laboratories, in a bid to speed diagnoses for suspected infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending swabs to labs including Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. It said this would significant expand the nation's capacity to test for monkeypox.  Previously, testing has largely been confined to public health labs, which combined have a capacity of about 8,000 tests per week.  'All Americans should be concerned about monkeypox cases', said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement.  'Thankfully we have right now the tools to fight and treat cases in America.  'By dramatically expanding the number of testing locations throughout the country, we are making it possible for anyone who needs to be tested to do so.' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was deeply concerned about the outbreak. 'I am deeply concerned about the monkeypox outbreak, this is clearly an evolving health threat that my colleagues and I in the WHO Secretariat are following extremely closely,' Tedros said. The 'global emergency' label currently only applies to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing efforts to eradicate polio, and the U.N. agency has stepped back from applying it to the monkeypox outbreak after advice from a meeting of international experts. New York City  health chiefs were blasted for their 'last minute' roll out of  monkeypox  vaccines just two days before the city's Pride weekend Friday — as scores of walk-ins were turned away on the second day of inoculations.    Last Thursday, the city became the first in the U.S. to start offering the jab to the most 'at risk' gay or bisexual men. But within three hours of launching the drive it was forced to suspend walk-ins due to 'high demand', and all appointments were booked solid until Monday. At least 100 men queued for the jab last Thursday morning, with many not having bookings arriving up to two hours before the clinic opened. But all walk-ins were turned away and told to check online for new slots.   Chris LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, slammed the 'pop-up' inoculation and slammed the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan for failing to turn up to monitor the vaccinations. Men waiting to get inoculated today said it was 'ridiculous' that only 1,000 doses were available in a city of eight million. Others slammed health officials for giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Many of those who got the vaccine today expressed their relief, saying they would now be able to enjoy the Pride weekend safely — which is expected to draw crowds numbering more than two million. One man even left the clinic telling a friend, 'we can make out tonight!'  No deaths have been recorded amid the 2022 outbreak, but health officials warn it could spill over into more vulnerable populations if the outbreak is not contained.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955541/Los-Angeles-health-officials-warn-monkeypox-outbreak-spreading-gay-men-cases-rise-22.html"},

America is rolling out the two dose Jynneous vaccine to fight monkeypox, with the second dose due to be given four weeks after the first. But some experts say it is possible to widen the gap — as was done with the Covid vaccine in other countries — to ensure more people can be inoculated first. A Food and Drug Administration vaccines adviser has warned against the move, however, saying no studies have been carried out to determine whether it will ensure the jabs are still effective. Both New York City and Washington D.C. are offering monkeypox jabs to gay or bisexual men with multiple sexual partners. It is unlikely that another European nation will surge ahead as experts say many — including the UK — are now seeing their outbreak start to peak.  Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, said: 'The U.S. was slow to kick off widespread testing, and so now is detecting transmission chains that have been carrying on uninterrupted for some time.  'We don't know how much increased awareness, especially in the core communities of gay and bisexual men, will slow transmission down. 'But it is reasonable to suggest that the U.S. case count will continue to grow and will outpace the outbreak's elsewhere.' Spain is at the center of Europe's monkeypox outbreak, being among the first country's to report the disease — with early cases linked to unsafe sex among gay or bisexual men at a venue outside the country's capital, Madrid, and a Pride event in the Canary Islands. Since then the vast majority of cases have been detected in the same group, but some have been spotted in women — often those living with gay or bisexual men. A three-year-old also tested positive for the virus. Health authorities in the country have rolled out vaccines to close contacts in order to curb cases, but there have been problems getting hold of doses.  Spain — like the U.S. — is using the Jynneous vaccine, but only had 200 doses available in early July. It has said more doses will be ordered, but has not specified a number. In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected. Hotspots New York City and Washington D.C. are rolling out vaccines against the virus to gay or bisexual men with multiple partners in two weeks to put a lid on the virus, but these programs have hit a brick wall with too few doses being supplied by the Federal Government.  Spain has the most per capita cases of monkeypox, while the U.S. has the greatest total number Both cities are now delaying second doses, due four weeks after the first, due to demand. A total of five million vaccines have been ordered so far, on top of the more than one million that were available when the program began.  Testing has also been ramped up after it was slammed early on for the stringent guidance on which samples could be tested leading to just 23 swabs being checked for the virus a day early in the outbreak. Five commercial labs have been brought onboard now with a combined capacity for about 80,000 swabs per week.  Daily tallies have rocketed since, with the biggest daily increase yet reported on Wednesday, with 1,048 cases in the last 24 hours. Breaking the data down by area shows New York City currently has the largest outbreak at 1,040 confirmed infections according to its Department of Health. The CDC says the state has 990 infections at present.  It was followed by California, at 356, and Illinois, with 341. Only four states — Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming — are yet to detect a single infection with the disease.  It is not clear whether other states — alongside New York — are preparing to start vaccinating gay or bisexual men where most cases are being detected to get a handle on the outbreak. Monkeypox is normally confined to West Africa, but earlier this year it was picked up at a Pride festival in Spain. Since then more than 40 countries worldwide — mostly in Europe — have spotted cases of the disease, which are mostly among gay or bisexual men. Unlike in previous outbreaks, the disease appears to mostly be spreading via sexual contact with lesions — which allow transmission — initially appearing on the genital and anal regions. Experts say the disease has likely already spilled over into other groups, however, which are more at risk.  In the U.S., two children were found to have been infected last week. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11056039/US-global-monkeypox-capital-record-breaking-1-048-diagnoses-24-hours-sees-total-pass-Spain.html"},
{"title": "REVEALED: Monkeypox is now in almost EVERY state in America - as nation's outbreak spiralled from dozens of cases a week to hundreds a day by mid-July as California, Illinois and New York declare a state of emergency", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 21:21, 3 August 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  has now been detected in almost every U.S. state as cases reached the 6,326 mark across 48 states, the District and Columbia and Puerto Rico — with only Montana and Wyoming not having logged an infection, official figures revealed today. The national outbreak of the virus has spiraled since the first case was detected in Boston,  Massachusetts , in late May. It has consistently surged by more than a hundred cases a day over the last three weeks amid ramped up testing with New York and  California  having emerged as national hotspots. Alongside  Illinois , they have declared emergency states to handle the virus. Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told DailyMail.com that the virus likely arrived in many states much earlier than when it was officially detected. He points to anecdotal reports from Spain of monkeypox-like patients in February — three months before the outbreak began in Europe.  Hanage warned it was now 'very widespread' and 'not under control' across the United States, and that there was 'huge concern' it could spill over into other groups. There is mounting concern that monkeypox — which spreads via physical touch — could already be transmitting into more vulnerable groups like children and pregnant women, who are most at risk from serious disease. Five cases have been spotted in under-18s so far and one in a mother-to-be, with experts warning there may be others that are not being picked up because of a lack of testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has repeatedly being slammed for its slow response to the virus, failing to ramp up testing quickly to spot cases and to roll out vaccines fast to stymie the tide of cases. The above map shows the states that have reported monkeypox infections up to August 2nd, the latest date available. It reveals that almost every one has now detected it except Montana and Wyoming MAY 18 (left) and JUNE 8 (right): The above maps show which states have detected cases of monkeypox virus, as it began to spread across the United States JUNE 22 (left) and JULY 6 (right): The virus was detected in yet more states and in larger numbers following celebrations for Pride. It has mostly been detected among gay or bisexual men JULY 20 (left) and JULY 27 (right): The CDC starts to report far more cases once testing is ramped up. It has recorded more than a hundred every working day for the past few weeks The CDC has made monkeypox a nationally notifiable condition starting August 1, making all states and localities report case figures to federal officials each day. They hope is that this will not only give Americans a more accurate daily look at the state of the virus, but also smooth out reporting figures each day. So far almost every infection has been detected in men, with the vast majority also identifying as gay or bisexual. But there are signs that the disease — spread via physical touch — may now be spreading to other groups. Within a week of the first case being reported in a man who had recently returned from Canada, New York and Florida both reported their first patients. By the end of June more than half of U.S. states — or 34 — said they had detected the virus at least once. Cities including New York and Washington D.C. began to administer vaccines against the disease to gay or bisexual men to quell the growing outbreak. Previous 1 Next                   A second child in California is thought to have been infected with monkeypox, health officials revealed today taking the U.S. tally to five. The youngster — under 17 years old — presented with unspecified symptoms of the virus at a clinic in Los Angeles. They received treatment, and have since recovered,  they said.  It is likely they became infected from a 'household contact', like in two other cases in children.  Cases among children are sparking concern because those less than eight years are at heightened risk of severe disease and death if they catch the virus. Two cases were reported in children in Indiana this week, although no further information was given. A case has also been reported in a toddler in California and a baby that was travelling through Washington D.C.   But the rollouts were dogged by delays receiving doses and there being too few to meet the 'enormous' demand to get inoculated. Into July the situation only worsened with the U.S. infection tally crossing the milestone of 1,000 cases within the second week of the month. By the end of this month 48 states — even Maine, Vermont and Alaska — had all picked up the infection. Cases spiraled over this month as testing capacity expanded from 1,000 to 10,000 swabs a day — with New York alone recording infections in four figures by the end of the month. A record 1,048 cases were reported on July 27, but the CDC said this surge was down to 'historical cases' being reported mostly from California — which had not updated its count for days. The growing sense of crisis led San Francisco to become the first city to warn it would declare an emergency over the outbreak. Days later it was followed by New York City, alongside the states of New York, Illinois and California as a whole. No declaration has yet been made at the federal level though it has reportedly been considered by the Biden administration. Several patients have been hospitalized so far — in some cases only because they could not isolate at home — but no deaths have been reported in the U.S.. There have been ten to date globally, including four outside Africa — with four in Spain and one each in Brazil and India.  Commenting on how the virus had spread, Hanage told DailyMail.com: 'We are not necessarily seeing spread, what we are seeing here is detection. 'There has been so little testing for so long and it has been so patchily applied... that what you are actually seeing is transmission chains that were already started some time ago and now finally people are cottoning on to them. 'That sounds like it is a positive thing, but it is not really.  '[The maps] show the outbreak is already very widespread and not under control. It really is only a matter of time before all states pick it up.' There is mounting concern that the outbreak — now at 6,326 infections — could soon spill over into children and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the virus. America has detected five cases in children to date, with the latest being in a child from Los Angeles, California. State officials say the youngster was 'symptomatic' but has now recovered. Two children have also tested positive for monkeypox in Indiana, while cases have been detected in a toddler in California and a baby that was 'travelling through' Washington D.C. Three of the cases likely caught the virus from 'household contacts'. A pregnant woman has also tested positive for the virus in the U.S., but did not pass on the virus to her now-born baby. Experts say it poses the greatest risk early in the pregnancy, because it could lead to developmental abnormalities in the fetus. Asked about it spreading to more vulnerable groups, Hanage said this was a 'huge question' that was causing 'a great deal of concern'. Dr Bill Hanage, from Harvard University, (left) warned there was great concern that the virus would spill over into other groups. Dr Robert Murphy, the executive director for the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, told DailyMail.com it was too early to tell whether cases had begun to peak because testing had been so inconsistent. Pictured above are men queuing to get the monkeypox vaccine in Encino, California. It is being rolled out to the group as this is where the most cases have been detected Pictured above are men queuing for the jab in San Francisco, California. The city has complained it is getting too few jabs 'It is unquestionably true that the virus can infect other groups,' he said, '[but] it is not clear how sustainable transmission is within those other groups.' 'The population as a whole remains at low risk, but we are going to have to be watching extremely closely to start checking how much transmission can occur within the other networks. 'At the moment, we are systematically under-identifying cases because we are not testing there.' There is no sign in the data yet that cases may be slowing down, with CDC officials warning at a briefing last week that they expect the tally to keep rising for 'weeks'. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  : First cases are confirmed in children and a pregnant woman, who are more at risk from the virus. Dr Robert Murphy, the executive director for the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, told DailyMail.com it was too early to tell whether cases had begun to peak because testing had been so inconsistent.  'Cases detected now were so under-report it is difficult to say what's happening now. There have been inconsistencies in testing, and this is also not a reportable disease in the United States which could impact the figures,' he said. But he said it was possible that the roll out of vaccines and raised awareness of the disease — which may be sparking changes in sexual behavior — could be slowing the spread of the virus. Even if the U.S. did get on top of the outbreak, however, it will likely need to brace for future introductions from other countries where the virus will continue spreading. In particular, this includes Africa where several nations including Nigeria have been battling an outbreak of the disease for years. America was recording less than ten cases a day during the first few weeks of the outbreak, but at the time medics were complaining they were struggling to get people with monkeypox-like symptoms swabbed for the disease. But when private labs were brought in last month — ramping up capacity to more than 10,000 swabs a day — the number of cases spotted every 24 hours rocketed into the hundreds. The CDC has been repeatedly blasted for failing to get swabs rolled out early leaving the United States unaware of the scale of the outbreak. It has also — alongside the federal government — being criticized for failing to offer swabs against the virus rapidly to those who are most at risk from the disease. Before the outbreak, the country's national stockpile was allowed to dwindle from 20 million to just 2,400 doses of the vaccine — a drop of 99.9 percent — in the years leading up to the outbreak. Initially, the stockpile was expanded over concerns that bio-terrorists could weaponize smallpox — which the vaccines also work against. But as the jabs three-year shelf life came to an end instead of replacing them federal officials invested in developing a longer-lived vaccine. This meant that by the time monkeypox struck there were very few doses still available in the country, slowing the roll out. This was then further hampered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) taking weeks to complete an inspection of a new factory where the jabs were being put into vials before being shipped to America. New York City, Washington D.C. and parts of California are among those currently rolling out the jab to all gay or bisexual men to help curb the outbreak — and have complained they are not receiving enough jabs.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11077465/How-monkeypox-spread-American-state.html"},

Gavin Newsom on Monday declared the  monkeypox  outbreak a state of emergency in  California , despite a gay, leather kink festival taking place in San Francisco over the weekend - a little more than a year since kids were banned from going back to school due to COVID. California became the second state in three days to take the step, after New York, and Newsom said the declaration will help state officials better coordinate a government-wide response, seek more vaccines and lead outreach and education efforts on where people can get treatment and vaccination.  'We'll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the  LGBTQ  community fighting stigmatization,' Newsom said. A booth offers information on monkeypox at the 'Dore Alley,' or also called the 'Up Your Alley' fetish and leather festival on Folsom Street in San Francisco on Sunday, as the viral disease keeps spreading in California. Nearly 800 cases of monkeypox have been reported in the state Nearly 800 cases of monkeypox have been reported in California, according to state public health officials. But that didn't stop the LGBTQ+ community on Sunday from organizing a street fair called 'Dore Alley' or 'Up Your Alley,' a leather and fetish event that is commonly compared to to the Folsom Street Fair — California's third-largest single-day and outdoor spectator event — as well as the world's largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture.  Festival officials made sure that this year's venue was more spread out and that hand sanitization stations were seen California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over monkeypox on Monday, becoming the second state in three days to take the step after New York -- the epidemic of the viral disease Kinky games and street vendors selling leather apparel including chokers, collars, whips and bondage kits are a common at the venue, which mostly attracts gay men out of any demographic. A sound stage was also set up for festivalgoers to dance. 'I like to think of it as the biggest leather block party,' Executive Director Angel Adeyoha told  ABC 7 .   She raised her concerns, however, over the timing of this year's festival, especially as it took place soon after the City of San Francisco announced a state of emergency over monkeypox on July 28.  'I don't know if you came in previous years, but you would be body to body. Clearly that's not the case now, we've made room for folks,' Adeyoha told ABC 7. In 2020, both the Up Your Alley Fair and Folsom were canceled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This year, the San Francisco Department of Public Health was on-site to inform the local community about the viral disease and to keep them safe by adding hand sanitizing stations. The festival was also more spread out than usual so people could freely roam around.  'I think probably more risky things in both Outside Lands and Dore Alley will be the things that happen after the event or around the private event spaces, where people are intimate with each other,' UCSF infectious disease specialist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong told  NBC Bay Area . With a growing monkeypox outbreak that has so far predominately affected gay and bisexual men, city officials in San Francisco have declared a state of emergency.

In 2020, the venue was canceled due to COVID  Previous 1 Next             The monkeypox virus spreads through prolonged and close skin-to-skin contact, which can include hugging, cuddling and kissing, as well as through the sharing of bedding, towels and clothing. People getting sick so far have mainly been men who have sex with men, though health officials note that the virus can infect anyone. 'Public health officials are clear: stigma is unacceptable and counterproductive in public health response,' Michelle Gibbons, executive director of the County Health Executives Association of California said. 'The fact is that monkeypox is primarily spread by skin-to-skin contact and sharing objects like bedding or towels, without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.' The type of monkeypox virus identified in this outbreak is rarely fatal and people usually recover within weeks. But the lesions and blisters caused by the virus are painful and can prevent swallowing or bowel movements if in the throat or anus. The declaration in California came after a similar one in New York state on Saturday, and in San Francisco on Thursday. Newsom's administration had said as recently as Friday that it was too soon for such a declaration. After pressing for Newsom to make such a declaration, State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-SF) hailed the governor's decision. 'The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,' Wiener said. People stand in long lines to receive the monkeypox vaccine at San Francisco General Hospital on July 12 A man holds a sign urging increased access to the monkeypox vaccine during a protest in San Francisco, July 18 Newsom's proclamation allows emergency medical personnel to administer monkeypox vaccines that are approved by the federal government. That's similar to a recent law that allows pharmacists to administer vaccines, Newsom's administration said. It said the state's response is building on the steps developed during the coronavirus pandemic to set up vaccination clinics and make sure there is outreach to vulnerable populations in cooperation with local and community-based organizations. California has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses and has distributed more than 25,000 doses. 'We don't have any time to waste,' Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement. She said the nation's most-populous county must use all available resources to speed the distribution of vaccines and help to those who have been infected. Newsom's office said Los Angeles County has received a separate allocation of vaccine. As of last week, the state had expanded its testing capacity to process more than 1,000 tests a week. Critics have said the long wait for test results delayed treatment options. New York City is home to one of the United States largest LGBT communities, and is in line to receive 110,000 doses of the federal governments 800,000 upcoming monkeypox vaccines - but Governor Kathy Hochul still wants more.  Case counts in New York City, the current US epicenter of the outbreak, surpassed 1,400 on Friday.

{"title": "Is America's monkeypox outbreak REALLY the worst in the world? Statistics show it has the eighth- highest case count per million residents - a fourth of Spain's total: The US has declared a public health emergency", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 19:31, 5 August 2022 ", "text": "The United States on Thursday became the first country to declare a public health emergency over the  monkeypox  virus, the only thing is: America's outbreak is four times smaller than the largest outbreak in  Spain , with statistics showing that it has the eighth-highest case count per capita, official figures show. The U.S. has detected the most monkeypox cases out of any country, with its total reaching 7,102 Thursday — more than a third higher than the 4,577 detected in the next highest country, Spain. But when this tally is considered per population — a more accurate measure because it takes into account America's much larger head count — the U.S. ranks eighth, with 21 cases per million people.  That's equivalent to one in 47,000 people having a confirmed infection to date. Conversely, in Spain, the number is 96 per million or one in 10,000, also higher than every American state. Dr Jessica Justman, an infectious diseases expert at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City, said even though the U.S. was behind other nations the number of infections detected and nature of illness — with patients suffering painful lesions — meant it was right to declare an emergency. Hundreds of cases are still being detected daily in the U.S. whereas in other European countries — like the UK — the outbreak is now slowing down. America moved to an emergency footing yesterday, two weeks after the World Health Organization also declared an international emergency over the outbreak. Justman added that other nations would likely follow suit, but said it was also possible they had not moved to this level of alert because of differences in how they operate. Experts have warned it would be the 'worst public health failure in modern times' should monkeypox become entrenched in the United States because it 'could have been prevented'. Unlike with Covid, accurate tests and effective vaccines were already readily available — but there has been a struggle to roll them out. The above left panel shows the total monkeypox infections detected per country over time, and on the right it shows this as a rate of per million people. Experts said it was more accurate to consider the data in this way because it shows the difference in infections between nations. Figures are from OurWorldinData, a data platform run by experts at Oxford University  The above graph shows monkeypox cases per capita in Spain, which has the highest infection rate, and the five U.S. states with the highest rates of the virus — New York, Georgia, Illinois, Florida and Maryland. It also shows the infection rate for the whole United States (the dotted line) The above shows the number of cases per state, and each states tally. This data is not shown as a monkeypox infection rate per million people Pictured above are people lining up to get a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine at Obregon Park in Los Angeles, California Figures for monkeypox infection rates per million people by nation were calculated by  OurWorldinData , a platform run by experts at the prestigious Oxford University in the United Kingdom. DailyMail.com used population data from the US census bureau to calculate infection rates per million by state. At the ground level, it shows Spain currently has the biggest monkeypox outbreak in the world per head with 96 cases per million people (one in 10,000). Portugal has the second highest rate at 69 per million, followed by the Netherlands at 54 per million and the United Kingdom at 39 per million. Germany (34), France (33), and Canada (23) also have a higher tally than the US. Previous 1 Next                   The EU is set to repeat its COVID vaccine shambles with a failure to deliver monkeypox jabs. Doctors are having to turn away patients because of a lack of doses, with the bloc's collective procurement policy stalling again. While the UK has ordered more than 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses, Eurocrats have procured just 160,000 for its 27 members. As many as 1,000 vaccinations were recorded in a single weekend in London. But in hotspot Madrid, where there have been monkeypox deaths, there have been only 790 vaccinations in total. Dr. Jean-Christophe Goffard, of the Erasme Hospital, in Brussels, said: 'The vaccine is not available in Belgium at the moment. 'We've had a growing demand for tests... and close to 90 per cent prove positive. 'We don't have the impression we are currently able to control the epidemic well.' The EU's two biggest powers, France and Germany, have turned their backs on the EU scheme and are buying their own vaccines. Spain was one of the first countries to detect monkeypox in men who attended Pride festivals in May, and there are anecdotal reports that the virus may have been circulating in the country as early as February. Both Spain and Portugal are yet to launch a mass vaccination drive for all gay or bisexual men — although this may be because both nations are struggling to get hold of adequate Jynneos doses from Bavarian Nordic, which is being used to treat the virus. But in Europe there are now signs that some monkeypox outbreaks may be starting to run out of steam as health authorities get a grip on the outbreak. In the UK, health authorities there say cases are now beginning to 'plateau'. They recorded 299 new infections over the past seven days, drawing level with the 261 infections detected the previous week. This is not the case in the United States, however, since which is now recording about 439 cases a day on average compared to just 224 two weeks ago. No clear data was available on testing rates, but if other countries are testing less this suggests their outbreaks may be outpacing the U.S. even further. America can currently carry out about 10,000 tests a day for monkeypox, but only about a tenth of these are being utilized. Asked whether the U.S. was right to shift to an emergency footing, Justman said: 'I think this is a situation that does require mobilization of resources of recruitment and access. 'Is it a response that has been done with careful thinking, and we should not dismiss this because it happens to primarily effect a smaller segment of the population.' She added: 'I am glad that the U.S. is declaring an emergency, that is a good thing.' There is no sign of other countries following suit. For example, in the UK monkeypox was only ever designated a level two outbreak — reserved for transmission within a defined sub-population. This is two markers off level four or the highest level of alert, when there is evidence of wider community transmission of the virus. Breaking down America's figures into states also shows that none have a higher infection rate for monkeypox than that reported in Spain. New York had the highest at 88 cases per million, followed by Georgia (50), Illinois (45) and Florida (26). Compared to their European counterparts, New York, California (which ranks 10th out of US states) and Illinois have each already declared emergencies over the outbreak of the virus and started rolling out vaccines to gay or bisexual men. At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, admitted officials were still not sure to what extent the cases they were detecting represented new spread or historic cases that were only now being picked up thanks to ramped up testing. But cases have risen by several hundred every day for the past few weeks, with the virus now being detected in every state except Montana and Wyoming — which are both very rural. Last week officials warned the tally would likely continue to rise for weeks. Monkeypox is a serious disease that triggers flu-like symptoms in the early stages before patients develop a rash that will spread across almost all of the body. It is not like COVID, being spread via physical touch alone. Almost every case has been identified in men with the vast majority identifying as gay or bisexual to date in America. But there are fears that it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk of serious disease. Pictured is a man receiving his first dose of the monkeypox vaccine at Dekalb County Board of Health in Atlanta, Georgia. Second doses are being delayed in many areas because of a lack of supply Pictured above are men waiting to receive a first dose of the monkeypox vaccine in New York City. It is at the center of the nation's outbreak of the virus At least five cases have been spotted in children so far — two in California, two in Indiana and one traveling through Washington, D.C. — who likely caught the virus from 'household contacts' and one case in a pregnant woman. Both groups are more at risk of serious illness. Declaring the emergency yesterday, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources Dr. Xavier Becerra said: 'In light of all of these developments and the evolving circumstances on the ground, I want to make an announcement today that i will be declaring a public health emergency on monkeypox. 'We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus.'  The declaration will make more resources available for states, allow for federal officials being deployed nationwide and enhance data collection on cases, hospitalizations and testing. Federal officials have been slammed for a delayed response to the virus so far, allowing it to potentially spread unrestricted for weeks before expanding access to testing and rolling out vaccines to the population. At current, the country can perform up to 80,000 monkeypox tests each week. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11084691/America-eighth-biggest-monkeypox-outbreak-world-data-shows.html"},

Dr Rochelle Walensky said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak.  It was not clear when they caught the virus, or what symptoms they suffered. They are receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation.   They are the first cases among children to be detected in America.

A  boy under 10 years old  tested positive for the virus in the Netherlands in June, as was revealed this week. The Dutch child suffered more than 20 red lesions on his face, forearms and thighs but had no fever or swollen lymph nodes — with the infection mostly clearing within a week.  Two children have tested positive for monkeypox in the United States since the outbreak began, it was revealed today Revealing the infections at a virtual event for the Washington Post, Walensky said: 'We have seen now two cases that have occurred in children. 'Both of these are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community, the gay men's community.' She added that these cases have been on the whole 'adjacent to the community most at risk'. Previous 1 Next             : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  In a press release, the agency said: 'CDC and public health authorities are still investigating how the children became infected. 'While both children have monkeypox symptoms, they are in good health.' They added: 'Monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which — in the case of children — could include hugging, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups and utensils.'  Last week the CDC said it was only aware of monkeypox infections among adults, mostly in gay or bisexual men. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert warned last week the virus had likely already spread to other groups, but that this was yet to be detected due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that children — as well as older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. In the Dutch case, doctors said they counted 20 lesions on the face, ear, forearms, thighs and back of the child — but that he did not suffer a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, they added. It was not clear how he became infected, although doctors said he likely had contact with an infected person or contaminated object that 'was not recognized'. Monkeypox primarily spreads through close physical contact or towels or bedsheets that have also been used by a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transmitted through the air.  The CDC has been repeatedly slammed for its response to the virus, with testing initially being slow to get off the ground masking the spread of the virus. There have also been problems rolling out the vaccine, with New York City — at the epicenter of the crisis — having to delay second doses for patients because too few jabs have been supplied.  A  Dutch  child under the age of ten has tested positive for  monkeypox  after a family holiday to Turkey - the first confirmed pediatric case as part of the current outbreak of the tropical virus.  The unnamed youngster was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes. Doctors counted 20 lesions over his face, ear, forearms, thighs and back, but the patient did not have a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, and he made a full recovery. None of his close contacts tested positive for monkeypox. It is not clear how he became infected, but testing has ruled out it being down to sexual abuse. The family-of-five said they had no close contact with other guests while on holiday and put their own towels on chairs and loungers. His parents, one of his siblings and a friend — who were all considered high-risk — were vaccinated with the Jynneous jab, which is being used in America.  The report comes as the United States confirms its first two cases of the tropical virus stateside, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The youngster — who has not been named — was taken to Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in late June complaining of rashes (pictured is one of the first on his jaw) More than 20 rashes erupted over his body, they said Pictured above is one of the rashes that appeared on his arm  Doctors at the Dutch hospital revealed the diagnosis Thursday in the journal  Eurosurveillance . Dr Marceline van Furth, who led the investigation, said they were publicizing the case to 'raise awareness... that monkeypox can develop in children'. They warned that children — alongside older adults and pregnant women — are more vulnerable to monkeypox, with about three percent dying form the infection. Previous 1 Next             A man in California says he has been infected with COVID and monkeypox at the same time in the first known case in America. Mitcho Thompson, a cannabis salesman in Sebastopol, tested positive for the pandemic virus in late June after feeling 'wiped out'. Days later, red lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which he said doctors diagnosed as monkeypox. Thompson was bedridden for weeks as trouble breathing and chills left him barely able to get up for water. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious diseases expert at Stanford University, said it was possible for someone to be infected by both viruses at once. He said Thompson had had 'incredibly bad luck'. It comes as America's monkeypox tally surges to 2,593 cases — the second highest tally in the world, right behind Spain, which has 3,125 cases. More than 16,000 cases have been detected globally in the current outbreak, mostly among gay or bisexual men who caught the disease through sexual contact. Experts fear the disease has likely already spilled over into other populations, but has not been detected yet because of a lack of testing. Monkeypox does not require sexual contact to spread, and is mainly transmitted via close physical contact or scabs that get stuck on towels or bedding. In rare cases it can also be passed on through the air. America has detected 2,500 cases in the current outbreak — the second highest tally in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. The Netherlands has spotted 700, while Turkey has detected a single case. The Dutch monkeypox patient first realized he was unwell shortly after returning from Turkey, when he noticed two small red skin lesions on his left cheek and jaw. His doctor initially diagnosed mild dermatomycosis — medical term for a fungal infection — and prescribed anti-fungal cream. But when more lesions appeared the medic feared he had impetigo — a bacterial infection that causes lesions on the body — and gave him antibiotics. When they continued to crop up over his ear, forearm, thighs and back the boy was referred to hospital with a suspected case of monkeypox — with swabs at the hospital being  positive. His parents and two siblings were then also tested for the virus, but all returned negative results. Dutch health authorities vaccinated both parents, one sibling and a friend who were deemed to be at 'high risk' of being infected. None later developed the virus. An investigation was launched to establish where the child caught the disease, but it was inconclusive. There was no evidence that the child had been near a suspected or confirmed case of monkeypox before catching the disease. The parents also said they had taken care while on holiday to use their own towels and had not had close contact with other guests, limiting the risk of transmission. Analyses revealed the strain the boy caught was the same as the one circulating in Europe's current outbreak. In the paper, the medics wrote: 'As no plausible source could be identified, this leaves us with an open question regarding transmission. 'In the current outbreak, the predominant route of transmission is related to sexual activity in the community of men who have sex with men. 'However, other indirect transmission routes have been described, such as respiratory transmission through droplets or contaminated materials such as bedding and towels. 'Therefore, it is possible that the child was in close contact with an infectious person or contaminated object that was not recognized as such.' They said it typically takes about eight-and-a-half days for someone infected with monkeypox to start showing symptoms. But suggested it was likely longer — up to 21 days — for the boy because the route of transmission was different. He had traveled to Turkey three weeks before symptoms began to appear. His parents said the boy had chickenpox when he was five years old.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11040679/Two-children-test-positive-monkeypox-CDC-confirms.html"},

The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. New York now has 141 cases of monkeypox, the most out of any city in the United States — which has registered 700 infections to date. Pictured above is the queue of mostly men waiting to get the monkeypox vaccine at Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan, New York City. Appointments ran out in minutes yesterday Vaccines against monkeypox are being offered to men who have sex with men who have multiple sexual partners in a week They are also available to any close contacts of suspected or confirmed monkeypox cases New York City is the first metropolis to record more than 100 cases of the virus in America New York's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is rolling out vaccines against monkeypox at the Central Harlem and Chelsea clinics. They also plan to bring in the Corona sexual health clinic, in Queens, over the next few weeks. At a press briefing yesterday the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan. Previous 1 Next             New York City became the first metropolis in America to record more than 100 cases of monkeypox late Wednesday, just over a week after its annual Pride celebrations. The city's Department of Health revealed it has now spotted 119 infections with the tropical disease, up by half on the same time seven days ago. Before the Pride weekend concerns were raised that the events — which drew crowds numbering more than 2 million — could spread monkeypox. In San Francisco officials have already linked several Pride-themed parties in nightclubs to outbreaks of the disease. America has recorded 700 cases of monkeypox to date, with most in New York, California and Florida. No deaths have been reported. This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. But residents have previously blasted these paltry tallies as 'ridiculous' considering the city has a population of several million. Officials initially released 600 appointments Wednesday but, because of the glitch, they only went to people who had a link to the old appointment site stored on their browsers. This meant these were all booked up before they were released to the general public. Later that same day another 1,900 appointments were made available — but these filled up in just 10 minutes. The city offered walk-ins during the first roll out of 1,000 doses, but quickly shelved them due to high demand.  Nicholas Diamond, one of those who spent hours refreshing the New York City website to get a dose, told the New York Times: 'By following the Department of Health's instructions, we had zero chance of getting the vaccine. 'I am really concerned that the city, state and federal government have learned nothing from the Covid response, and essentially the burden again has been left on us to figure out how to care for ourselves.' Announcing the launch of the roll-out, Vasan said: 'Providing vaccine for New Yorkers at highest risk of transmission will ensure more New Yorkers are protected against monkeypox. 'Thank you to our federal partners for providing the necessary support we need to curb transmission and keep New Yorkers safe.' He added that the city would continue to 'work with' the federal government to secure further doses. Patients are being offered the Jynneous vaccine, which is given as two doses about four weeks apart. Experts say recipients should have some protection shortly after getting the first dose, but that they won't be fully protected until about two weeks after the second. The jab — made using weakened smallpox viruses — is about 85 percent effective against infection with the disease. New York City became the first major city in the country to hit more than 100 cases of monkeypox yesterday, more than a week after Pride celebrations. Washington D.C. is the only other area rolling out jabs to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners at present. Monkeypox is spread by direct physical contact with infectious skin lesions, which in the current outbreak are appearing in the genital and anal areas. Health chiefs have been repeatedly slammed for their slow response to the outbreak, in echoes of the Covid era, and for failing to make enough tests and vaccines available for people affected.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10995625/Dozens-people-line-monkeypox-vaccine-NYC.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox isolation rules DITCHED for contacts of infected because virus is mainly spreading through sex - as UK buys another 100,000 vaccines to thwart ever-growing outbreak", "author": "Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 19:05, 19 July 2022 ", "text": "Close contacts of  monkeypox  cases will no longer need to self-isolate unless they develop tell-tale symptoms, UK health chiefs announced today. Only those who develop ailments such as a fever, headache and rash after being in contact with someone infected will now need to stay at home.  UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said the change, which includes people who have had sex with the infected, is because only a 'relatively small number' of contacts develop monkeypox.  Officials said there is a 'lack of evidence' the rash-causing virus — usually only spotted in west and central Africa before the current global outbreak took off in gay and bisexual men — is spreading outside of intimate contact and sex. Dr Merav Kliner, deputy incident director at UKHSA, said that while self-isolation is easing, monkeypox still poses a 'serious public health challenge'. Contacts should still 'take a break' from skin to skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing 'to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly', she said. Meanwhile, the UKHSA today confirmed cases had surpassed the 2,000 barrier.  It has bought 100,000 extra doses of the smallpox vaccine, which works against its milder cousin monkeypox and is offered to close contacts and some gay and bisexual men as part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak. As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. The US today entered a new deal to buy half a million more doses of the vaccine, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. Its extra supply will be delivered this year. For comparison, the UK is understood to have just 25,000 doses — 20 times fewer than America's order Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious Previous 1 2 Next                         : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. : A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   The UKHSA guidance sets out new steps for high-risk monkeypox contacts — including sexual contacts who did not use a condom, household contacts and medics who treated an infected person without PPE. Until now, contacts had to isolate for 21 days.  As well as not having to isolate, these groups now should only contact NHS 111 or a sexual health clinic if they develop symptoms. A fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion are the initial monkeypox symptoms, which are followed by a rash that looks like chickenpox or syphilis.  However, high-risk contacts are told to avoid skin-to-skin contact with others, refrain from sexual contact, avoid international travel and let dentists know you are infected. People who have physical contact with a monkeypox case or touched their bedding are told to avoid contact with under-fives, pregnant women and the immunosuppressed. If they work with anyone from these groups, the UKHSA or their employer may inform them to take time off after a clinical assessment. Health teams are offering smallpox vaccines, which are 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, to close contacts who had a high-risk exposure to an infected person. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been proven to work in other outbreaks. And gay and bisexual men who are at a 'high risk' of catching monkeypox were offered the jab from last month. But latest UKHSA data shows the outbreak is continuing to grow.  Since the first case was detected on May 6, there has been 2,137 confirmed monkeypox infections. And the figure for July 18 is up by 272 since July 14. Of these, 2,050 are in England, 51 are in Scotland, while 23 are in Wales and 13 in Northern Ireland. Within England, the vast majority (1,492) are in London. Hotspots also include the South East (172), North West (115) and East of England (82).  Almost all of cases so far have been identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community.  But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash. Almost all of the cases are mild and no deaths have been recorded.  Dr Kliner said: 'We have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow. 'Based on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms. 'While our advice on isolation is changing, monkeypox is still a serious public health challenge, and we urge contacts to take a break from any activities or events involving skin to skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly.  'Stay alert to symptoms and call a sexual health clinic if you become unwell. 'Thank you to all contacts who have isolated already in response to this outbreak. We understand that isolation can be difficult but this was a necessary precaution whilst our knowledge of the outbreak was limited.' It comes as health chiefs today bought another 100,000 smallpox vaccines from Denmark-based Bavarian Nordic. The doses will arrive between July and September. The UK had already ordered 30,000 doses of the vaccine to rollout to infected people and their contacts.  Studies have shown Imvanex — known as Jynneos in the US — is around 85 per cent effective at preventing a monkeypox infection. The vaccine was developed for use against smallpox but offers cross-protection against monkeypox because the viruses are so similar. Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: 'Monkeypox is a rare and usually mild disease that does not spread easily between people. 'But we are taking action to help further manage the outbreak in the UK by procuring over 100,000 additional doses of vaccine. 'The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine, and I would urge people to take up the offer as soon as they are contacted.  'In the meantime, please contact a sexual health clinic if you notice any unusual rashes or lesions. 'I am hugely grateful to the fantastic sexual health staff and 111 call handlers for working hard to keep the current outbreak under control.' Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, head of immunisation at UKHSA said the additional doses mean the UK is 'in an even stronger position to bring the current monkeypox outbreak under control'. She said: 'Although most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people. 'So it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.  'Anyone can get monkeypox and we continue to urge anyone with a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, to take a break from events, meeting with friends or having sexual contact.  'Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.'   Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually spread by infected rodents — including rats, mice and even squirrels — in west and central Africa. Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs, or eat wild game or bush meat. The orthopoxvirus, which causes monkeypox, can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people. However, health chiefs insist it was very rare until the current outbreak. Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs. The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.  In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.  Yet, the disease  However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. The West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain, is behind the current spread. No deaths have been reported as part of the ongoing outbreak. It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox. Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab — the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.  It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms. Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. The UK Health Security Agency advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last three weeks. Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid contact with others until they have been seen by a medic. Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.  The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox. The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.  Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization. This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971. The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.  Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak. But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them. Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.  MailOnline revealed monkeypox patients and their close contacts, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.  The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease. Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection who have symptoms are being told to stay at home. And those without symptoms are told to avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'. As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact. Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a wider targeted jab rollout to more NHS staff and female sex workers in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'. Close contacts of the UK's known cases and some gay and bisexual men are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar. A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise. Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups. He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.  More than 70 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have detected cases of monkeypox. Most cases have been detected in the UK, Spain, Germany, US and France. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.  The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.  Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection. There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.  An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11029133/Monkeypox-isolation-rules-DITCHED-contacts-infected.html"},

In a separate interview with  NBC 5 , he revealed a contact tracer first alerted him that he had been exposed to the rash-causing virus.

'The pain and tenderness was constant,' he said. Asked whether it was like Covid, he said: 'Oh, 100 times worse. this was a totally different level of extreme fatigue.' Shannahan was diagnosed two weeks and a day ago, and says most of his symptoms have now subsided. But he will still remain in isolation for at least three weeks. Patients must remain in quarantine until all their blisters have scabbed over and the scabs have dropped off because even these could spread the virus, according to official guidelines. Shannahan has set up a gofundme page to replace lost wages as a bartender, which has so far made him $1,700. Texas has recorded 81 cases of monkeypox to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. These are mostly among gay or bisexual men, although this week the Lone Star state also announced its first case among women. Nationwide, infections have quadrupled over the last two weeks amid a surge in testing for the virus. It has prompted warnings from some top experts that America has likely 'lost control' of the disease. But CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky hit back against the claims yesterday, insisting they were 'misinformed and off base'. Other experts say it will take another few days to become clear whether the rash-causing virus is now out of control in the United States. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic Monkeypox patients are offered the Jynneous vaccine in the early stages of their illness, which doctors say can help reduce symptoms. It is set to help kick-start the immune system to fight the virus off. Many are also being offered TPOXX, an antiviral which works by stopping the monkeypox virus from invading other cells. It was designed for use against smallpox, but is also being used to fight monkeypox infections because the two viruses are closely related. There are mounting concerns over a shortage of monkeypox vaccines in the U.S. at present.  New York City and Washington D.C. are the first to start offering the jab to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. But in both appointments are running out in minutes when they are released, with New York now warning it may not be able to dish out second doses. Residents have branded it 'ridiculous' that there are so few vaccines available in a city of more than eight million.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11031999/Complete-hell-Texas-man-says-monkeypox-100-times-worse-Covid.html"},

Bloomberg  reports that in order to quell a shortage of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine officials are planning on delivering doses of the vaccine that are only 0.1 milliliter (ml) - a massive fall from the 0.5 ml standard dose. They believe that using an intradermal injection - which delivers the vaccine between the layers of the skin instead of underneath the skin's fat - will make sure the shot is just as effective. The FDA is set to approve plans to cut the dosage of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine by 80%, and deliver it intradermally in a bid to solve America's vaccine shortage (file photo) It comes in response to a massive shortage in monkeypox vaccines available in the U.S. Officials have so far distributed only 600,000 doses to state and local jurisdictions around the country. When jabs have become available in major population centers like New York City, appointments have been filled within minutes due to the exceedingly high demand. The science behind the move is limited, though. A single 2015  study  funded by the National Institutes of Health shows that vaccines can be just as effective through the intradermal route, but no other data exists. This would be a massive shift in America's response to the virus based on limited existing evidence. The move comes as the U.S. logged a record 1,424 cases on Monday, the highest total since the global outbreak first found its way stateside in May. In total, the U.S. has logged 8,934 infections - the most of any country. This outbreak could soon get worse as well. The new school year is set to begin at colleges and universities across the U.S. in the coming weeks. Young students are more likely to engage in careless sexual behavior, creating a perfect storm for potential monkeypox outbreaks around the nation. Previous 1 Next             Officials wrote in an email obtained by Bloomberg that the FDA will soon give emergency clearance to the rationed jabs.  The Jynneos vaccine was developed by Bavarian Nordic for smallpox, but it also effective against monkeypox. Last week, FDA Chief Robert Califf explained that this new approach will allow the nation to make the most of its resources without losing effectiveness. 'The upside is you can stretch out doses,' Dr John Moore, a virologist at Cornell University told the  New York Times  of the plan.  'The downside is, if you cut it too far or take too many liberties, you reduce the efficacy. And how are you going to know that? It's educated guesswork.'  Federal officials currently have access to around 1.1 million shots - well short of enough to cover vulnerable populations in America. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services declared the virus a public health emergency, opening the door for regulators to make these types of moves. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that America's monkeypox outbreak can still be controlled But there are some questions as to whether this is the right move. In 2015, researchers gathered that smallpox vaccines were just as effective when delivered in smaller doses if the injection was performed intradermally. It was just one study performed on 524 participants, though, and using a different vaccine. Currently, shots are mainly reserved for men who have sex with other men - though some exposed people have been granted the shot as a precaution. Access to the shots may need to be expanded soon. Some officials fear that the virus has already escaped that sexual network and is now in other groups as well. 'There's a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Dr Scott Gottlieb, formed FDA chief, told  CBS' Face the Nation  over the weekend. 'We're continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.' While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that gay and bisexual men still make up a majority of cases.  The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point. Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained. 'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate. 'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11096293/US-regulators-set-clear-new-monkeypox-vaccine-technique-rations-jabs.html"},

Public health leaders from the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSD) and George Washington University (GW) warn that a fractured and lacking response to the outbreak so far can have severe consequences. Previous experts have warned that the virus has likely been spreading undetected in the U.S. for some time, and fear it could become endemic in the nation is not curbed soon.  As if Friday - the most recently available data - the U.S. has logged 460 cases across 31 states and the District of Columbia.  Iowa  is believed to have recorded its first case over the weekend as well, though Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) figures have not yet reflected it. Previous 1 Next             'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told  The Hill . 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' Testing for the virus has been a slow and arduous process so far. When a patient begins exhibiting symptoms of the virus they are first examined for the orthopox family of viruses. The lineage includes monkeypox - along with the extinct smallpox virus - and it is likely that anyone who tests positive for it does have the tropical infection. The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. In order to confirm a monkeypox case, samples must be sent to the CDC for testing, where it is then confirmed. Testing is slow, though. Access to these test is limited as well. This makes many experts fear that cases are going undetected. The federal government has taken steps to expand capacity but access to tests is still relatively limited. There have also been cases detected so far with no links to international travel or to another case of the virus - meaning there is some undetected circulation of the virus ongoing. 'We've been sort of screaming for a month about how bad the diagnostic situation is for monkeypox,' James Krellenstein, cofounder of Prep4All, told The Hill. 'And that really was a clear error, preventable, and it's very clear that this administration has not learned lessons from early Covid.' The nation's vaccine rollout has been under intense scrutiny as well. American officials have ordered around 4.4 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine - including an additional 2.5 million last week. Getting the shots into arms has been a challenge, though. New York City had its first public vaccine event two weeks ago - ahead of Pride festivities in the Big Apple - but demand for the jabs was so high officials had to cut off walk-in appointments in a matter of hours. People waiting at the clinic for the shot told DailyMail.com that the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million.  Other eager recipients accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed.  Some experts are comparing the currently broken response to monkeypox to that of COVID-19 when it first erupted in March 2020. 'I think we'll continue to repeat these mistakes because that's been our track record. That's been our track record,' Jon Andrus, a global health professor at GW, said. 'We've had, what, more than five or six waves of Covid, and we seem every time to be a little bit caught off guard,... stopping transmission requires that we're all reading from the same page. We all have the same road map.' ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10980519/Experts-warn-soon-lose-control-monkeypox.html"},

Yesterday the city became the first in the U.S. to start offering the jab to the most 'at risk' gay or bisexual men. But within three hours of launching the drive it was forced to suspend walk-ins due to 'high demand', and all appointments were booked solid until Monday. At least 100 men queued for the jab this morning, with many not having bookings arriving up to two hours before the clinic opened. But all walk-ins were turned away and told to check online for new slots. Chris LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, slammed the 'pop-up' inoculation and slammed the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan for failing to turn up to monitor the vaccinations. Men waiting to get inoculated today said it was 'ridiculous' that only 1,000 doses were available in a city of eight million. Others slammed health officials for giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Many of those who got the vaccine today expressed their relief, saying they would now be able to enjoy the Pride weekend safely — which is expected to draw crowds numbering more than two million. One man even left the clinic telling a friend, 'we can make out tonight!' New York City is America's monkeypox hotspot with more than 39 cases detected so far, with almost all among gay and bisexual men. Nationwide the tally has hit 179 cases, with fears mounting the rash-causing virus is spreading undetected. More than a hundred men lined up outside the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan today to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. The clinic only admitted people who had got appointments, and turned away all others Two lines had formed this morning outside the clinic. One was for people hoping to get a walk-in jab - who had been there since at least 9am - and the second was for those with appointments. New York City suspended walk-ins yesterday just three hours after the clinic opened due to 'high demand' Attendees were first screened at a pop-up clinic (pictured) to ensure they were eligible for the jab. They were then sent inside to one of seven booths where the vaccine was being administered by a nurse. Recipients had to wait about 10 minutes after they were inoculated to ensure they suffered no side-effects. Men who have sex with men, and had multiple sexual partners over the past two weeks are eligible for the jab Pictured above are men embracing each other while they wait in the queue for the Jynneous vaccine. The jab is designed to fight off smallpox infections, but scientists say it also works against monkeypox because the two viruses are similar Chris LeBron, the Democrat candidate for the 75th district — which includes the Chelsea area of Manhattan — blasted New York City's health officials for their last minute and 'random' roll out of the vaccines.

The jab is being rolled out via appointment between 11am and 7pm New York City is offering gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners within two weeks the monkeypox vaccine at the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan. Today marked the second day the vaccine has been administered in the city, with a line of men in their 20s and 30s forming outside the clinic. It has the capacity to vaccinate up to 170 people a day at present, with seven nurses jabbing one person every 20 minutes. After getting the jab, recipients are required to wait for a further 10 minutes to ensure they have not suffered any side-effects — like with the Covid jabs.  New York City says it will be open from 11am to 7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. It is yet to open up bookings for appointments this Monday.  It is rolling out the Jynneous jab — which is 85 percent effective against infection — which is administered as two doses four weeks apart. Experts say recipients gain immunity from monkeypox days after getting the first jab. Previous 1 Next                   Chicago will put a 'special emphasis' on warning Pride attendees of the risks of catching monkeypox this weekend, while San Francisco's parade will be punctuated by regular announcements over the disease amid fears the events could spark an uptick in cases. The Windy City's Department of Public Health told DailyMail.com they would put out guidance on social media and print fliers to be handed out at events. In San Francisco, California, which is also due to host a parade this Sunday, announcements will be made on 'best practice' when in crowds. America is gearing up to celebrate Pride this weekend in major cities — with crowds expected to exceed two million in New York alone. But it comes amid a growing outbreak of the rash-causing virus with 179 cases detected so far, many among gay and bisexual men.  Several cases are not linked to international travel or other known infections suggesting it is already spreading undetected. New York City became the first to offer jabs against monkeypox to the most 'at risk' men this weekend. But it has been slammed for rolling out so few doses.  Experts say vaccinated people have protection shortly afterwards. Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, said for people exposed to monkeypox it gives protection 'immediately' providing it is administered within the first four days of contact with a case. Blasting the Department today and health commissioner for the city, LeBron told DailyMail.com: 'Do I think enough is being done? No. 'The fact that these vaccines just popped up and a random announcement was made is actually detrimental to individuals faith in Government when dealing with a health crisis like this. It does nobody any good. 'I do believe the Health commissioner of New York City should be here, present, to assess what's happening right now. 'There is a line of individuals waiting for canceled appointments, and there is a high need clearly for this vaccine. 'He needs to come here, he needs to assess, he needs to apply proper policy and planning to ensure that these individuals get the service they deserve.' People began lining up for the vaccine — even if they didn't have an appointment — from 9am this morning, in either the appointments or walk-ins lines. By the time the clinic opened its doors at 11am, more than 100 people were queuing up for the jab and the line stretched around the side of the vaccination center. Among those turned away was Yougourten Ayouni, 24, an advertising technology consultant who came back today after queuing for two hours yesterday and being sent away. He told DailyMail.com that staff working the clinic kept 'contradicting' each other, with some saying they were not taking walk-ins and others saying they would but only after five or six hours when they see how many appointments were missed. Slamming the Department, he said: 'Everybody is not on the same page and they have only a thousand vaccines and there website is already booked up. 'I don't understand why even start telling people to just wait and get an appointment etcetera. They are just not being honest, they are not being forward, and everybody is not on the same page.' Derek Brant, 33, a sales manager and one of the few to get vaccinated today, said it was an 'incredible' stroke of luck to get the jab but also 'ridiculous' that New York City had so few shots available. 'It's kind of ridiculous that there are only 1,000 doses,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I feel very lucky to have got one, I'm trying to count my blessings about it.' He heard about the clinic yesterday via a friend who sent him a link to the vaccination clinic. Another furious couple leaving the clinic, who asked not to be named, said it was a 'disgrace' that these jabs were being handed out just a day before the city's Pride weekend. New York City announced yesterday that it was rolling out the monkeypox vaccine to the most at risk men. Pictured above is the queue to get the vaccine that formed today  Pictured above are men queuing to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. They will need to return for a second jab in the next four weeks, and are being invited via email Men began queuing from 9am this morning to get the vaccine. Pictured above are several waiting in the queue Recipients told DailyMail.com the jab did not hurt to get. Many were given a plaster afterwards (pictured) A health worker talks to a man waiting in line for the vaccine to protect against monkeypox  : A total of 47 people are found to have been infected with the virus after coming into contact with animals.  This was linked to a shipment of 800 rodents — including squirrels —  from Ghana to Texas. Some of the infected animals were then moved to Illinois and housed near Prairie dogs. They passed on the virus to these animals, which then gave it to humans when they were rehomed. : An individual in Texas is found to have been infected with monkeypox after returning to the U.S. from Nigeria.  A total of 200 people were monitored for infection, but after 21 days none had developed symptoms. : An individual tested positive for the virus after returning to Maryland from Nigeria. They did not pass the virus on to others. : A man is found to have been infected with the virus after returning to Massachusetts from Canada. In this outbreak more than 170 cases have been spotted across almost 25 states. New York City has been sent 1,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine to date — which is enough to jab just 500 residents. As well as rolling out doses through the clinic, it has also offered some to close contacts of known monkeypox cases to head off their infection. Other cities are also dishing out the jabs to close contacts. America has more than 74,000 doses of Jynneous and more than a million shots of ACAM2000 — which is also at least 85 percent effective against infection — in its arsenal, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a briefing on June 10. DailyMail.com has asked the CDC how many have been offered to each state, and how many have been rolled out to date. Another 300,000 Jynneous doses are expected to arrive in the U.S. within weeks, along with a further 500,000 before the end of the year. Both jabs are designed to trigger immunity against smallpox, but scientists say they will also work against monkeypox because the two viruses are very similar. Gay or bisexual men who got their monkeypox vaccines today emerged from the clinic jubilant and feeling 'lucky' to be among the few to get inoculated. One even exited telling a friend: 'We can make out tonight!' Marcello Santiago, 35, who owns a pet grooming store, was among those to get the vaccine today. He told DailyMail.com that he now felt protected and safe after getting the shot ahead of Pride. Caesar, 30, a fashion designer who did not give his last name was also among those to get the shot today. He said it 'felt great' to be inoculated and that he was looking forward to having a 'Prideful weekend'. Another couple, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com they came to get the vaccine because it seemed like the 'prudent' thing to do. They said they had been concerned about attending large events in Brooklyn this weekend without being jabbed. America has now recorded more than 170 cases of monkeypox, with New York City having the most infections out of any major city. Breaking down the figures by state, California has the most cases (48), followed by New York state (30) and Illinois (19). Today's roll out comes ahead of a weekend of Pride celebrations in the city, where the health department plans to hand out fliers at events to warn people over the risks of contracting the disease.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10950761/New-York-City-health-chiefs-blasted-minute-random-monkeypox-jab-roll-out.html"},

Professor Paul Kelly's dramatic declaration on Thursday means the virus will now require national policies, intervention and public messaging - not unlike how Covid was dealt with. Australia's paltry number of cases is in stark comparison to the infections overseas, with it spreading throughout Europe and the US recording more than 1,000 new cases.  Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declared monkeypox as an 'incident of national significance' The declaration follows the  World Health Organization 's announcement on Wednesday that monkeypox virus is to be treated as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. More than 20,000 monkeypox cases have been recorded in 71 countries which have no previous record of the virus, including Australia where 44 cases have been reported. The virus has existed for many years but is usually contained to portions of west and central Africa where it is endemic, meaning it circulates among the population regularly.  The majority of Australia's cases have been reported in returned international travellers.  However, Mr Kelly reassured Australians the virus is far less harmful than Covid, with serious disease or death very unlikely. 'Monkeypox is also not transmitted in the same way as Covid and is far less transmissible,' he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared monkeypox a 'public health emergency of international concern' on Wednesday 'Monkeypox rash and flu-like symptoms are relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments.' Monkeypox can cause a wide range of symptoms that varying in severity from case to case. Symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. Previous 1 2 Next                   These symptoms are accompanied by a rash identified by pus-filled lesions that lasts between two and three weeks. The WHO says a person is no longer infectious once the lesions have 'crusted over, the scabs fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath'. The virus can spread from animals to people as well as person to person through body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has recommended two smallpox vaccines to protect against the monkeypox virus The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended the use of two smallpox vaccines to immunise the population against monkeypox in response to growing concerns. The two specific vaccines it recommends are third generation JYNNEOS and second generation ACAM2000. 'Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur, particularly in immunocompromised people,' it said.   ATAG advised supplies of the vaccine have been secured by some states and territories.  Professor Kelly said the majority of cases in Australia have been detected in men who have sex with men, which has also been reported overseas.  Monkeypox is a viral infection that spreads from animals to people and person to person.  The disease's most recognisable symptoms is a rash which can last two to three weeks. It can be found on the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and genital and/or anal regions of the body. The most common symptoms include a fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. The severity of symptoms changes from case to case. Some people will experience mild symptoms while others will feel them severely. People at higher risk of severe disease include people who are pregnant, children and the immunocompromised. Most cases of monkeypox heal on their own within a few weeks. However, severe cases of the disease can result in serious complications or death. Newborn babies, children and people with underlying immunity problems may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.  Complications from the disease can include secondary skin infections, pneumonia, confusion and eye problems.  Source:  World Health Organisation", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11056301/Australias-chief-medical-officer-sounds-alarm-monkeypox.html"},

'But they are changing the name because racism or something.' 'So, we had a vote,' Carlson then said: 'There was no ballot harvesting. You can trust our counting. And the new name for monkeypox is now officially – and we’re declaring it – schlong COVID. That won our audience election result with about 40% of the vote. So, let Rochelle Walensky at the  CDC  know.' Walensky is the director of the CDC, and one of the most public health officials in the United States' The term 'schlong COVID' appears to be a reference to the fact that around 95 per cent of people so-far infected by COVID have been gay men.    Carlson's Twitter poll had more than 26,000 votes, with schlong COVID the favorite among 39 per cent of respondents. Midterm Variant was runner-up, with 24 per cent, while Adam Schiffilis came third, with 20 per cent, and Hunter Hives was fifth, with 17 per cent.  Some progressive health officials have asked for monkeypox to have its name changed because the original title could be construed as racist. Last month, the World Health Organization said it would rename the disease, although it has yet to announce the replacement term.   The results are in. Monkeypox will now officially be called “Schlong Covid.”  pic.twitter.com/nEFZjvWAnV July 29, 2022 Tucker Carlson said Thursday the winner of his Twitter poll to rename 'monkeypox' was 'Schlong covid,' in reference to the high rate of gay men contracting the disease Monkeypox has exploded in the US, with New York and California becoming the hardest-hit states. San Francisco's mayor declared a state of emergency over the disease, in part because of calls from LGBTQ leaders The jokes came as San Francisco, a city with a high population of gay people, declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak of the disease.  Mayor London Breed's said her announcement would allow officials to cut through red tape and fight a public health crisis reminiscent of the AIDS epidemic that devastated the city in the 1980s.  Monkeypox generally resolves itself with mild symptoms, while AIDS had an almost 100 per cent death rate for the first 15 years of the epidemic, up until the mid-1990s.  Others have suggested that San Francisco is an overreaction.   'We are at a very scary place. And we don't want to be ignored by the federal government in our need. So many leaders of the LGBT community have also, weeks ago, asked for additional help and support and assistance,' said Mayor London Breed. The city is in 'desperate need of vaccines,' she said. Previous 1 2 Next                   The declaration, which takes effect Monday, was welcomed by gay advocates who have grown increasingly frustrated by what they called San Francisco's lackluster response to a virus that so far has affected primarily men who have sex with men, although anyone can get infected. 'San Francisco was at the forefront of the public health responses to HIV and COVID-19, and we will be at the forefront when it comes to monkeypox,' said state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents the city. 'We can´t and won´t leave the LGBTQ community out to dry.' The city has 281 cases, out of about 800 in California and 4,600 nationwide, according to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. A national shortage of vaccine has resulted in people waiting in line for hours for scarce doses, often to be turned away when the shots run out.  The United States has become the global epicenter of the  monkeypox  outbreak, overtaking  Spain  following a record-breaking 24 hours in which 1,048 new cases were confirmed.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on Wednesday that the uptick in cases was likely due to an increase in testing, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week. But the infection rate in the U.S. is below many other European countries including the UK and Germany (both at three per 100,000).  Experts fear the disease has already spilled over into more vulnerable groups, such as children under eight years old that health officials say are at high risk of severe disease.  Two children — in California and 'transiting through' D.C. — have tested positive for monkeypox to date, the CDC says.    America's response to monkeypox was slammed for being too slow to roll out tests and vaccinations at the start of the outbreak, especially to gay or bisexual men where most cases are being recorded.  No deaths have been registered to date but several patients have been hospitalized.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11060439/Tucker-Carlson-pushes-rename-monkeypox-Schlong-COVID.html"},
{"title": "Could monkeypox be the next West Nile Virus? Scientist warns tropical disease could be next to establish itself in the US after other arrived in 1999 and gained a foothold within a year", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 18:02, 22 June 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  may become endemic in the U.S. just like the West Nile Virus did after spilling over into the wild mosquito population two decades ago, an expert warns. Dr Bobbi Pritt, a pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in  Minnesota , told DailyMail.com a key similarity between the diseases was that both had spread under the radar before being detected. But she said monkeypox is likely to prove much easier to control because it was mostly being spread through sexual contact with infectious skin lesions, whereas the other is 'indiscriminately' transmitted by mosquitoes. The West Nile Virus (WNV) became endemic to the U.S. just a year after its arrival and is now the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the country — sparking tens of thousands of cases every year. About eight in ten people infected with the virus suffer no symptoms, but for those that do one in five face a fever, headache and vomiting while one in 150 can suffer encephalitis — inflammation of the brain. About 70 deaths related to the disease are recorded every 12-months. European health chiefs have warned monkeypox could also jump into the animal population, although add the risk remains 'very low'. There was a risk the tropical disease would in 2003 when it infected more than 40 prairie dogs, but the outbreak was eventually snuffed out. The warning comes after America recorded another 28 cases of monkeypox over this weekend and the Juneteenth across 23 states and Washington D.C. New Jersey, Indiana and Missouri were the latest states to detect the disease this weekend. The tally has now hit 142, but no deaths have been recorded in the U.S. or other countries currently facing an outbreak.  The above map shows states that have detected monkeypox (Red) in the current outbreak and those that are still to, the cumulative number of monkeypox cases every week day (left) and cases by state (right) The above map shows states that have detected West Nile virus this year. The incidence rate is per 100,000 people. Hawaii is yet to report its disease incidence The above map shows the states that have reported West Nile Virus in humans (dark green) and other animals (light green) since 2021. It shows the virus is now in every state of the country. Hawaii is yet to report its case count Warning that monkeypox could become established in the U.S. just like WNV, Pritt said: 'I would hesitate to say monkeypox is endemic yet, although it definitely has this potential.'  'It will be, however, easier to prevent monkeypox from spreading. 'They have quite different modes of transmission. WNV is spread through mosquito bites and is really quite indiscriminate. But monkeypox is mostly spread through sexual contact, at the moment particularly among men who have sex with men — although it could reach other populations. Previous 1 Next                   West Nile virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes, which can pick it up from birds. It was discovered in Uganda in the 1930s and is now found on almost every continent in the world. It reached the U.S. in 1999, likely on a shipment from the Middle East. The disease now triggers tens of thousands of cases every year, although most go unreported because eight in ten develop no symptoms. People who catch the disease generally do not show symptoms until three to 14 days later. Those that do develop warning signs tend to suffer flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and headaches. About one in 50 cases develop a severe illness, however, where they can face a coma, tremors and paralysis. About one in 150 patients could also suffer encephalitis— inflammation of the brain — which is life threatening. There is no specific treatment for West Nile Virus patients, but severely ill patients will be admitted to hospital for close monitoring. People with mild illness are recommended to get over-the-counter pain relieves to reduce their fever and other symptoms.  About 70 people die from the disease in the U.S. every year.   Sources:  CDC   'This could be stopped through practicing safe sex. 'There is more chance of stopping it than WNV. With WNV it can only really be stopped by wearing insect repellant.' American health chiefs took nearly two weeks to diagnose their first case of monkeypox in Massachusetts after standard swabs failed to detect other infections. They only decided to test the patient for the tropical virus after spotting alerts from Europe — led by the UK — over the outbreak there. In comparison, a WNV outbreak was spotted in New York City in late August after eight previously healthy people who lived within 16 miles of each other were struck down with encephalitis. The tropical disease has been known for decades after it was first spotted in the West Nile district of Northern Uganda in 1937. Since then it began to pop up in several other countries across the continent, parts of Asia and even in Romania, Europe. The disease arrived in the U.S. in 1999, likely on a shipment that had come from the Middle East — where Israel was also experiencing an outbreak at that time. It is not clear whether it was in geese or another bird that was imported or arrived via mosquitos that hitched a ride on a ship. Health officials became suspicious of its presence in late August when they spotted suggestive-cases in Queens. There also spotted many birds falling sick with a virus that had a high fatality rate. WNV is spread by mosquitoes to humans and birds, after the insect picks up the disease from another infected animal — which could well be an unwell bird. The following year they detected another outbreak of the disease, and within three years it had been recorded across as many as 44 states. It also triggered a major outbreak in 2002 when a total of 4,100 cases were detected including more than 2,000 people who suffered from encephalitis. There were also 284 fatalities. But Pritt said because so many people who catch the virus suffer no symptoms, it was likely the true case tally was in the tens of thousands. Other experts have also warned monkeypox could mimic WNV in becoming established in the country.  Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins in Maryland, previously told  CNN : 'It got seeded into the mosquito populations and... bird populations and was able to establish itself,' he said. But he also warned this was a far from inevitable outcome for monkeypox pointing out that '2003 was a good opportunity for it to happen' but that this did not occur. Monkeypox — which is native to West Africa — was first spotted in Europe in May, with cases traced back to unsafe sex at mass gatherings which took place in Spain and Belgium. It was then first detected in the U.S. a few weeks later in an individual who had recently returned from Canada, but the World Health Organization says it could have been spreading for years beforehand.

They passed on the virus to these animals, which then gave it to humans when they were rehomed. : An individual in Texas is found to have been infected with monkeypox after returning to the U.S. from Nigeria.  A total of 200 people were monitored for infection, but after 21 days none had developed symptoms. : An individual tested positive for the virus after returning to Maryland from Nigeria. They did not pass the virus on to others. : A man is found to have been infected with the virus after returning to Massachusetts from Canada. Another case is currently being probed in New York City.  Most infections are being spotted among gay and bisexual men and linked back to international travel — including to Europe. But a growing number of cases are now being spotted with no links to other infections or international travel, suggesting the virus is already spreading under the radar in the country. It comes after New Jersey recorded its first suspected case of monkeypox in Jersey City yesterday, with a sample now being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. The patient was told to isolate at home, and contact tracing is now underway. They said on Instagram: 'The NJ Department of Health has confirmed the first case of monkeypox in Jersey City. Our health officials are working closely with the CDC. 'The local health department is conducting contact tracing to identify any individuals who may have been exposed to the individual. 'Most New Jersey residents are not at risk of infection with monkeypox.'  Globally, the CDC counts 2,525 total cases across 37 separate countries, with the United Kingdom leading the way with 574 and Spain in second place with 497 confirmed cases of the virus. Medical literature says that people infected with monkeypox experience flu-like symptoms within the first 21 days of catching the virus, followed by a rash that appears on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. But this is rarely being observed in the current outbreak, with patients instead seeing rashes emerge on the genital areas before suffering any flu-like symptoms. Dr Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said: 'The disease is not spread through casual conversations, passing others in a grocery store, or touching things like door-knobs,' she said. 'All of the case we have seen to date in this outbreak have been related to direct contact.'", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10941781/Could-monkeypox-West-Nile-Virus.html"},

The woman has now given birth to her child, who does not appear to have caught the rash-causing virus from the mother. CDC released limited information on the case, including where in the US the woman was based. It's also unclear when the woman was infected, or exactly when she gave birth. Health officials said both were 'doing well', but the nation's top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that pregnant woman may face a 'profound risk' from the virus.  A maternity doctor told DailyMail.com that women in the early stages of pregnancy faced the biggest risk from monkeypox. The mother may have been in the final stages of her pregnancy when infected, as she recently gave birth.  The newborn received immune globin, an infusion of antibodies capable of fighting diseases including monkeypox, officials said. It is not clear what treatment the mother received. It is the first infection to be detected in a pregnant woman in the United States, and comes after America recorded its first two infections in children last week. The pediatric cases were unrelated and detected in California and Washington D.C. There are currently 3,591 monkeypox infections confirmed in America — the second biggest outbreak in the world behind Spain's 3,738 cases. Pictured above is the spread of monkeypox cases across the United States. New York has the most infections at present, followed by California and Illinois The U.S. currently has the second biggest monkeypox outbreak in the world, behind only Spain which was one of the first countries hit by the disease America has detected its first monkeypox case in a pregnant woman in the United States. Pictured above are images of cells infected with monkeypox virus (red dots) Dr John Brooks, chief medical officer in the CDC's monkeypox response, revealed the case during a webinar with the Infectious Diseases Society of America Saturday.   'There has been a case of a pregnant woman who delivered,' Brooks said. 'The neonate received the IG prophylactically (immune globin given to prevent disease). Both mom and baby are doing well.' CDC officials confirmed the case to DailyMail.com. Their website warns pregnant women are 'more likely to get seriously ill or die' from monkeypox.

There are now more than 3,000 cases nationwide. : Two children and a pregnant women test positive for monkeypox, as the disease spreads to other groups. The children were in  California and traveling through Washington D.C., it was not clear where the woman was. Fauci — the top infectious diseases expert in the U.S. — warned in an interview about yesterday that pregnant women were among those more at risk from monkeypox. He told NPR: 'We've got to understand the modality of transmission, the manifestations, also the risk for people like children and pregnant women. There's really a profound risk. 'Right now, thank goodness, we have a report of only two cases in children, but they're all at risk populations.'  Dr Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine expert at Rosh Maternal and Fetal Medicine in New York, told DailyMail.com that pregnant women and their babies faced the greatest risk from monkeypox early in pregnancy because the babies organs were still developing, raising the risk of birth defects. In the later stages he said babies are more at risk of catching the virus because there is more blood flow to them, but less likely to suffer birth defects as most organs are already developed. He told DailyMail.com: 'If they catch the virus in the first ten weeks of pregnancy since the baby has just started to develop there is a greater risk of congenital abnormalities. '[But] in the third trimester there is more blood flow from placenta to the fetus and it's easier to get the virus.' Pregnant women who catch monkeypox can pass it on to their babies in the womb via the placenta. It can also be transmitted once a child is born through close contact — such as cuddles — and there may be a risk of it being passed on via the breastmilk. Roshan said immune globin would be administered to a pregnant woman who caught monkeypox to help fight off the infection. Asked how the parent became infected, Roshan said this was likely via close contact with an infected patient. He advised pregnant women to observe 'normal protocol' to avoid becoming infected. 'I would say they should just be careful with the contact,' he said. 'Stay away from people with rashes or fever, and follow personal hygiene.' The CDC says that babies born to pregnant women should be washed immediately after birth with wipes and soapy water. In guidance published this week, they add doctors should then decide whether to administer a vaccine to the child or antiviral. Infants must then be monitored for 21 days — during which time they should be looked after by a carer or family member — to ensure they have not caught the virus. Infected mothers should steer clear of their children until all the lesions triggered by monkeypox have scabbed over, and the scabs have fallen off. Dr John Brooks, chief medical officer in the CDC's monkeypox response, revealed the case in a pregnant woman during a webinar on Saturday. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's leading infectious diseases expert, said pregnant women were at 'profound risk' from the virus Medical literature shows monkeypox infections in pregnant women have previously led to miscarriage, stillbirth, early delivery and infection in the womb. But it is not clear how often these occur, because so few pregnant women have previously been infected. A 2017 study that tracked four pregnant women with the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo found two miscarried there babies and there was one fetal death.  Smallpox, monkeypox's now-eradicated cousin, was also more severe among pregnant women. Last week the CDC revealed America's first two cases of monkeypox had been detected in children as the virus spreads to other groups. One is a toddler from California, while the other is an infant who was travelling through Washington D.C. when the case was detected. Neither had contact with each other. It is thought both children likely caught the virus from 'household contacts', which includes people they live with and visitors to their home. Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak. They have received the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert has warned that the virus has likely already spread to other groups, but was not being detected among them yet due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that pregnant women are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11054073/Pregnant-woman-tests-positive-monkeypox-America.html"},

Days later, red lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which he said doctors diagnosed as monkeypox. Thompson was bedridden for weeks as trouble breathing and chills left him barely able to get up for water. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious diseases expert at Stanford University, said it was possible for someone to be infected by both viruses at once. He said Thompson had had 'incredibly bad luck'. It comes as America's monkeypox tally surges to 2,593 cases — the second highest tally in the world, right behind Spain, which has 3,125 cases. Mitcho Thompson, a cannabis salesman in Sebastopol, says he has been infected with COVID and monkeypox at the same time.

But a few days later, lesions erupted across his back, legs, arms and neck, which doctors diagnosed as monkeypox Thompson — who also has a pet cat — revealed his diagnosis with both diseases during an interview with  NBC Bay Area . He told the broadcaster: 'The COVID was first, and that's what made it really weird because I did not actually realize I had monkeypox until I started breaking out [in lesions]. 'The doctor was very certain that I have monkeypox and that I have both. Previous 1 Next             America still has the 'opportunity' to contain monkeypox, the director of the CDC has insisted as the cases tally rises to the second-highest in the world. Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed in an interview today the Government's response is growing stronger every day. She added: 'I think we still have an opportunity to contain this.'  But her comments come as the United States recorded another 270 infections, taking its tally to 2,593. This is the second-highest in the world, behind only Spain which has recorded more than 3,000. America's response to the outbreak has been slow from the outset, with the CDC taking weeks to get testing up and running. In the early days of the outbreak it was carrying out less than 100 a day. The federal government has also been slammed for failing to roll out vaccines quickly, which public health experts say would have helped to slow the spread of the virus.  'That was the question, could I get them both at the same time, and he said \"yes, yes, yes.\" ' Thompson said both viruses left him feeling 'really sick.' 'And the worst of it was honestly was just when I could barely get out of bed, and you could barely like get a drink of water.' A COVID infection triggers flu-like symptoms including a fever, cough, shortness of breath and muscle aches. A monkeypox infection also triggers these warning signs in the early stages, which then develop into a rash that spreads across the body. Thompson said he tested positive for COVID, however, ruling out the possibility that his flu-symptoms were just the result of monkeypox. It was not clear how Thompson caught monkeypox or COVID, or what treatments he had received. Health authorities are offering antivirals like Paxlovid to COVID patients to help fight their infection, and vaccines to those who test positive for monkeypox which they say can reduce symptoms. Asked whether it was possible to catch COVID and monkeypox at the same time, Winslow said: 'It's certainly not impossible for that to occur, it's just, you know, incredibly bad luck.  'But they are very different viruses.  'Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses that smallpox is.  'One of the small good things about monkeypox is it is really transmitted almost exclusively by very close contact and not necessarily sexual contact but certainly very close contact.' Monkeypox belongs to the orthopox family of viruses, which tend to trigger rashes in those they infect. On the other hand, COVID is part of the Coronaviruses family — which get their name due to the spike proteins that surround them 'like a crown'. Another key difference is that COVID transmits primarily through droplets expelled into the air, whereas monkeypox only does this in very rare cases, when there is 'sustained' face-to-face contact. It came as the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) insisted America still had the 'opportunity' to contain monkeypox. Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed in an interview Friday that the government's response is growing stronger every day. 'I think we still have an opportunity to contain this,' she said.  But her comments came as the US cases tally rose to the second-highest globally, and after other experts warned the disease is likely now out of control.

Its infection rate is also below many other European countries including the UK and Germany (both at three per 100,000). The U.S. may also now be carrying out more tests for the disease than its European neighbors — meaning it is more likely to detect cases, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week.  Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned that it was 'reasonable' to suggest America's cases tally would 'outpace' those in other nations.

Previous 1 Next                   Washington D.C. has postponed its roll out of second doses of the monkeypox, joining New York City. Its Department of Health revealed the move Monday, citing 'very limited' supplies of the jabs and a fast increase in cases. They said: 'This is extremely important because getting more individuals vaccinated with their first shot will help us contain the virus.' America is rolling out the two dose Jynneous vaccine to fight monkeypox, with the second dose due to be given four weeks after the first. But some experts say it is possible to widen the gap — as was done with the Covid vaccine in other countries — to ensure more people can be inoculated first. A Food and Drug Administration vaccines adviser has warned against the move, however, saying no studies have been carried out to determine whether it will ensure the jabs are still effective. Both New York City and Washington D.C. are offering monkeypox jabs to gay or bisexual men with multiple sexual partners. Based on these figures, America's tally could rise above Spain's as early as Saturday this week. It is unlikely that another European nation will surge ahead as experts say many — including the UK — are now seeing their outbreak start to peak. Asked whether the U.S. would soon have the worst outbreak, Hanage said: 'The U.S. was slow to kick off widespread testing, and so now is detecting transmission chains that have been carrying on uninterrupted for some time. We don't know how much increased awareness, especially in the core communities of gay and bisexual men, will slow transmission down. 'But it is reasonable to suggest that the U.S. case count will continue to grow and will outpace the outbreak's elsewhere.' Spain is at the center of Europe's monkeypox outbreak, being among the first country's to report the disease — with early cases linked to unsafe sex among gay or bisexual men at a venue outside the country's capital, Madrid, and a Pride event in the Canary Islands. Since then the vast majority of cases have been detected in the same group, but some have been spotted in women — often those living with gay or bisexual men. A three-year-old also tested positive for the virus. Health authorities in the country have rolled out vaccines to close contacts in order to curb cases, but there have been problems getting hold of doses. Spain — like the U.S. — is using the Jynneous vaccine, but only had 200 doses available in early July. It has said more doses will be ordered, but has not specified a number. In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected. Hotspots New York City and Washington D.C. are rolling out vaccines against the virus to gay or bisexual men with multiple partners in two weeks to put a lid on the virus, but these programs have hit a brick wall with too few doses being supplied by the Federal Government. Both cities are now delaying second doses, due four weeks after the first, due to demand. A total of 5million vaccines have been ordered so far, on top of the more than one million that were available when the program began.  Testing has also been ramped up after it was slammed early on for the stringent guidance on which samples could be tested leading to just 23 swabs being checked for the virus a day early in the outbreak. Five commercial labs have been brought onboard now with a combined capacity for about 80,000 swabs per week.  Daily tallies have rocketed since, with the biggest daily increase yet reported last Thursday with 298 cases spotted within 24 hours. Over Friday, Saturday and Sunday another 596 cases were recorded — or 198 per day —, CDC figures show, but capacity is generally lower on weekends because many people are away from their desks. Breaking the data down by area shows New York City currently has the largest outbreak at 1,040 confirmed infections according to its Department of Health. The CDC says the state has 990 infections at present. It was followed by California, at 356, and Illinois, with 341. Only four states — Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming — are yet to detect a single infection with the disease.  It is not clear whether other states — alongside New York — are preparing to start vaccinating gay or bisexual men where most cases are being detected to get a handle on the outbreak. Monkeypox is normally confined to West Africa, but earlier this year it was picked up at a Pride festival in Spain. Since then more than 40 countries worldwide — mostly in Europe — have spotted cases of the disease, which are mostly among gay or bisexual men. Unlike in previous outbreaks, the disease appears to mostly be spreading via sexual contact with lesions — which allow transmission — initially appearing on the genital and anal regions. Experts say the disease has likely already spilled over into other groups, however, which are more at risk.

Earlier this month when the number of confirmed cases stood at just over 3,000 in Spain, it was identified as the monkeypox world leader.  The earliest cases in May were linked to a gay sauna in Madrid and a Pride festival in Gran Canaria.  Last week the World Health Organisation declared monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed.  Monkeypox has affected more than 16,000 people across 75 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Previous 1 2 Next                   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee.  It was the first time the chief of the U.N. health agency has taken such an action. 'We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,' Tedros said. 'I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members of the committee,' he added. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. Director General Dr Tedros said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was 'high'.  The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio.   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (above) made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee Although monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spread beyond the continent or to move widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of individual outbreaks in Europe, North America and elsewhere.  Traditionally, people with monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11062969/Monkeypox-claims-victim-Europe-Spain-confirms-4-200-cases.html"},

In a bid to stem case numbers, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today confirmed some gay and bisexual men would be offered the Imvanex vaccine — which is 85 per cent effective — to control the outbreak. Under the plans, which come from the same experts who advised on the Covid vaccine rollout, medics will offer the jab to men who have multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues. Until now, the jab was only offered to confirmed cases and their close contacts under a strategy called ring vaccination, which has been proven to work in other outbreaks. Experts told MailOnline a fortnight ago the next sensible step if infections continued to spiral would be to widen the vaccination programme in a targeted rollout to more men who have sex with men, anyone visiting a sexual health clinic and NHS staff. It comes as Covid-weary Britons were today warned that the monkeypox outbreak could get 10 times bigger by experts behind gloomy models used to justify lockdown restrictions. The modelling suggested, however, that any surge in cases among groups other than gay and bisexual men was 'unlikely'. Meanwhile, British health bosses reported another 219 infections today — the highest daily toll — bringing the UK total to 793. London is the country's virus hotspot. Dozens of countries, including the US, Spain and Germany, have been struck by the outbreak — the biggest ever detected outside of Africa to date. Almost all of infections so far have been spotted in the men who have sex with other men community.

Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20.

It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles.   The UKHSA today published a strategy which set out that some gay and bisexual men at 'higher risk' of exposure to monkeypox should be offered a vaccine to control the outbreak. Officials have not put a number on how many men will be included in the rollout. Anyone can catch the virus, which is spread by close contact with an infected person. But most cases in the ongoing surge are among the 'sexual networks' of men who have sex with men.  Monkeypox, which will be renamed because of claims that it is discriminatory towards Africa, is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection. But it is thought to be the main mode of transmission in the ongoing outbreak.  The virus, first discovered in lab monkeys in the 1950s, can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone who is infected. Under the plans, endorsed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), those eligible for  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — a pill that protects against HIV — will also be eligible for the vaccine. This includes people who do not always use condoms during sex and are likely to continue not using them, as well as sex workers or their clients who report having unprotected sex. NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted. As well as gay and bisexual men, the list of NHS staff eligible for the jab is also being expanded. Healthcare workers caring for monkeypox patients in specialist high consequence infectious disease (HICD) wards are already offered the jab. But now staff in other hospitals designed to care for monkeypox patients will also be offered the jab, as well as workers in laboratories that test for the virus. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: 'Our extensive contact tracing work has helped to limit the spread of the monkeypox virus, but we are continuing to see a notable proportion of cases in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  'By expanding the vaccine offer to those at higher risk, we hope to break chains of transmission and help contain the outbreak. 'Although most cases are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to target groups where spread is ongoing. The NHS will soon set out details on how this will be delivered – so do not come forward for the vaccine yet.' The UKHSA is urging all Britons to be alert to any new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body, particularly if they have had close contact with a new partner. Those with symptoms are told to avoid close contact with others and call NHS 111 or your local sexual health centre. Alex Sparrowhawk, health promotion specialist at HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'This targeted vaccination programme is a positive move forward while the data still shows monkeypox is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK.' Robbie de Santos, director of communications and external affairs at LGBT charity Stonewall said it welcomed the vaccine being offered to those who are most at risk of catching the virus. He said: 'It is important that gay and bi men get the vaccine when offered to protect themselves and others. Let's help get the outbreak under control so we can all have a safe and happy pride season.' It comes as the UKHSA today confirmed Britain's outbreak has grown by 38 per cent since Friday to 793. Among the 766 cases with confirmed addresses, 498 are in London, 37 are in the South East and 26 are in the North West. All other regions have logged 20 cases or fewer. Public Health Scotland on Sunday said that all cases appear to be 'generally mild and not life-threatening' with no reported deaths in the UK to date. Monkeypox cases have been aged 37, on average, health bosses said.   Meanwhile, scientists behind the monkeypox modelling that warned of another 10,000 cases include Professor John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist who was among the most outspoken SAGE members during the Covid outbreak. Two other study authors are also Government advisers, sitting on the notorious SPI-M modelling committee. It warned of up to 6,000 deaths per day in the run-up to the Christmas just gone, despite the actual peak being 20 times lower. Without tough interventions, they also warned Omicron could potentially cause daily hospitalisations to breach 10,000 — quadruple the figure that happened in reality. In their latest modelling, Professor Edmunds and other LSHTM scientists looked at how monkeypox could keep spreading. Their estimates were based on sexual partnership data in the UK, gathered from a survey of 45,000 people that is conducted every decade. At the time of the modelling on May 31, 728 confirmed and suspected cases had been reported worldwide in more than 25 countries. Since then, almost 3,000 infections have been logged worldwide. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious The results, published on pre-print website  medRxiv , show that without interventions or changes in sexual behaviour, it is 'highly likely' that a 'major outbreak' would be seen among men who have sex with men. A major outbreak was defined as being at least another 10,000 cases, on top of the ones already detected. The modellers said their findings, which have not been peer-reviewed, show that a 'small fraction' of individuals with a 'disproportionately large' number of sexual partners could explain the 'sustained growth' of monkeypox among men who have sex with men. Monkeypox likely always had the risk of 'substantial transmission potential' among this community, their paper states.  But it has not been able to take off because too few cases have been logged outside of Africa over the past few decades, they said. However, the team said sustained transmission in other groups is 'unlikely'.  But they noted that between 10 and 10,000 extra cases could be spotted outside of the men who have sex with men community if lots of this group become infected. The monkeypox R rate — a term made famous during the pandemic, which reflects the number of people an infected person passes the virus onto — may be 'substantially greater than one' which could make it challenging to contain the outbreak, their paper states.  Contact tracing and vaccinating close contacts of infected people — the approaches used in the UK — only work if almost all contacts of an infected person are identified, they warned. They said experts should identify 'acceptable and effective' ways of preventing transmission among men with the highest number of sexual partners who could have a 'disproportionate effect on transmission overall'. Monkeypox is usually mild and has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning it can take three weeks for the tell-tale symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. It can, however, kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. But the milder strain causing the current outbreak has a case-fatality rate of around one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.  No deaths linked with the ongoing outbreak have yet been reported. Outside of the UK, Spain (497), Germany (421) and Portugal (297) have logged the most infections. Experts have warned monkeypox could become endemic among animals in Europe, as it is in parts of Nigeria, if the virus spreads to pets and wildlife. This would make animals a permanent reservoir of the virus that could infect humans, triggering sporadic outbreaks.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10937773/Monkeypox-outbreak-10-TIMES-bigger-Scientists-warn-major-epidemic-highly-likely.html"},

The Indiana Department of Health announced the infections, but refused to give any further information citing privacy concerns. They join a toddler in  California  who has caught the virus, and a baby who tested positive while traveling through Washington D.C. A pregnant woman was also found to have been infected last week. It raises concerns because children under the age of eight years are at higher risk of a more severe monkeypox infection. More than 5,800 cases have been spotted in America so far — the biggest outbreak in the world, mostly among men and gay or bisexual individuals. But experts warn the disease will likely spill over into other groups because it only requires physical touch to be passed on. No deaths have yet been recorded in the United States, but ten fatalities have been registered worldwide including four out of Africa. The two in Spain are reported to be among young men.   The above map shows countries that have detected monkeypox (yellow) and that have confirmed a monkeypox death (red). There have been ten fatalities globally so far Revealing the cases in children last week, the state added: 'No additional information about the cases will be released at this time due to patient privacy.' They did not say whether they had been hospitalized, or what treatments they were being offered.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed the first two cases in children a fortnight ago, but said both were 'doing well' at the time. DailyMail.com has asked for an update.

It is thought they most likely became infected from 'household contacts', which can include family members as well as visitors to where they live. Dr Rochelle Walensky said both the children had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected currently. The two youngsters were receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with how the virus matures. Monkeypox infections have been mostly confined to adult men — who were behind more than 99 percent of total cases last week. But experts are repeatedly warning the virus will spill over into other groups because it only requires physical contact with lesions to transmit. This has sparked concern if it spreads to children, because evidence suggests they are at risk of more severe disease. The World Health Organization warns that children — alongside older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of youngsters with monkeypox die from the disease, although this depends on the strain they catch. Announcing the case in Indiana, state health commissioner Dr Kris Box said: 'Monkeypox does not easily spread through brief casual contact, but it's important to remember that anyone can be affected if they are a close contact of a positive case. 'Hoosiers who believe they may have been exposed or who develop symptoms consistent with monkeypox are urged to contact a healthcare provider.' Indiana has the 17th biggest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, with 54 infections recorded to date. But this has grown rapidly from two weeks ago, when there were just 11 cases detected. The biggest outbreak is in New York City where 1,390 cases have now being detected followed by California (827) and Illinois (520).

{"title": "CDC launches Emergency Activation Center to combat growing monkeypox outbreak in US as cases hit 244 with 43 added over Pride weekend", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor", "date": " 20:51, 28 June 2022 ", "text": "The  CDC  has launched an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to combat the nation's budding  monkeypox  outbreak, the agency announced Tuesday. It comes as the nation's case tally reached 244, including 43 that were added to the ledger after the weekend. No U.S. deaths have been tied to the virus. Some experts fear that true case figures are even higher than reported, as the virus is spreading uncirculated as those infected may miss signs that they have it and the nation's testing infrastructure is relatively limited. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched the EOC to serve as the center point in coordinating the response to the virus in a bid to expand the response to the virus. A move of this type signals that the agency worries that the outbreak could continue to grow and even get out of hand - like it has in some European countries - if the response is not fortified. The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days The CDC has launched an Emergency Activation Center to combat the rise of monkeypox in the U.S. It will have more than 300 dedicated staff members (file photo) Previous 1 Next             'Today, CDC continues to lean forward with an aggressive public health response to the monkeypox outbreak by activating its Emergency Operations Center (EOC),' the agency wrote in a statement. The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. 'This action stands up the CDC’s command center for monitoring and coordinating the emergency response to monkeypox and mobilizing additional CDC personnel and resources. CDC’s activation of the EOC allows the agency to further increase operational support for the response to meet the outbreak’s evolving challenges.' The agency says that more than 300 staff members will work within the EOC. It comes just after the final weekend of Pride month, which many feared would spark outbreaks of the virus that has spread across communities of gay and bisexual men around the world. It is likely that many cases of monkeypox are also going undiagnosed due to a lack of testing, or being written off as another infection. Last weekend America recorded its biggest two-day rise in monkeypox infections since the outbreak was detected last month. The rash-causing virus is likely spreading under the radar as well. Several cases now not linked to a previously known infection or international travel, and experts have warned that poor surveillance methods are leaving populations vulnerable. Nationwide, California has the biggest outbreak, with 67 cases, followed by New York with 37 and Florida and Illinois with 27 each. Globally cases now top more than 4,000 across about 60 countries, but only one death has been recorded to date in an individual from Nigeria. While cases are mostly being detected among men who have sex with men at present, there are fears it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk from the disease, such as the immunocompromised. The disease is primarily passed on through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions, leading to fears it could also become entrenched as a sexually transmitted disease.

She also labeled herself a 'Christian Nationalist,' which earned appreciative noises from the crowd at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Tampa, Florida. Greene gave a brief but fiery speech on the second day of the conference. Her popularity among Republican teens and young adults was clearly evident in the standing ovation she received both before and after her speech. 'We have a new global pandemic, have you heard about this? Monkeypox, that's right,' the congresswoman said. 'It's the newest thing.' 'Listen, you guys have to update your social media, right next to your Ukraine flag emoji and your vaccine shot emoji, you need to make sure you have a monkey emoji.' She appeared to be taking a shot at left-wing Twitter personalities who add emojis to their profiles to show allegiance with certain causes. Greene joked, 'I want you all to be with it, you can't be behind, you have to have full outrage over everything that the left and the media tells you.' Just a few chuckles could be heard from the crowd.  It comes hours after WHO declared the global monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. Nearly 3,000 cases have been reported in the US so far - including, recently, two children.   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got a standing ovation both before and after her remarks at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit Her comment about monkeypox came hours after the World Health Organization labeled it a global emergency A line that was more warmly received was Greene proudly labeling herself a 'Christian Nationalist.' Being a nationalist, she said, means 'you care about your country.'  'That's not a bad word,' she said as the audience cheered. 'That's actually a good thing. There's nothing wrong with leading with your faith.'  She added that leading with that Christian Nationalist mentality is 'what the Republican Party should be about' and encouraged the millennial and Gen Z Republicans to lead with their 'proud Christian faith.' 'If we do not live our lives and vote like we are nationalists - caring about our country, and putting our country first and wanting that to be the focus of our federal government - if we do not lead that way, then we will not be able to fix it,' Greene said. Previous 1 Next                         Greene also blasted her colleagues in Washington for caring more about 'corporate welfare' than 'American workers,' earning appreciative applause from the crowd. But the audience erupted in cheers when Greene called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  'Our government right now, the Biden administration, is completely corrupt, and I'm going to tell you something right now - Joe Biden should be impeached,' she said. 'And I'm also going to add, so should Nancy Pelosi.' Greene's call to jail the president's son, Hunter Biden, prompted chants of 'Lock him up' that caught on across the nearly-full room. A cardboard sign with the likeness of former President Donald Trump is viewed during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, Friday, July 22 Hundreds of young Republican voters descended on Tampa for the multi-day event   'I think we should,' she added after the chants subsided, before pivoting to making fun of her political rival Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'Speaking of getting locked up, let's talk about someone that was arrested just this past week - AOC.' The progressive New York lawmaker was arrested with 16 other House Democrats during a pro-abortion protest outside of the Supreme Court on Tuesday. She sparked widespread mockery when images and videos of her arrest appear to show Ocasio-Cortez holding her hands behind her back as if she was handcuffed - despite pumping one fist in the air to supporters in a show of solidarity. Ocasio-Cortez has denied faking being handcuffed. 'You don't play in the road like AOC and her girlfriends, right?' Greene asked the crowd. 'They were out there playing in the road, laying in the road in front of the Supreme Court and the Capitol Police had to tell him to get off the road. But what did they do? They got arrested.' Of the handcuffs controversy, she added: 'See? It's all fake, it's a great big lie.' 'Because you know what? That's what a lot of people in Congress are. They're great, big liars. And that's what we have to change,' Greene said.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11042421/Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-calls-Christian-Nationalist-speech-young-Republican-gathering.html"},

Glastonbury revellers are warned of skin-to-skin contact danger by health chiefs as the music event returns for the first time in three years after Covid delays", "author": "Kaya Terry", "date": " 02:13, 23 June 2022 ", "text": "Jubilant festivalgoers at Glastonbury have been warned of skin-to-skin contact and the danger of  monkeypox  by health chiefs as the music event returns for the first time in three years after Covid delays.  To the dismay of many festival-goers, showers and thunderstorms are predicted from Friday onwards, and the event coincides with three days of planned major rail strikes over rail workers' pay, leading to travel disruption for people making their way to Worthy Farm in Somerset. The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) has now urged the 20,000 people who are set to descend on the site for the five-day-long festival to be mindful of the disease as case numbers in the UK continue to rise.  So far 793 people in the UK have tested positive for the virus, with the vast majority of these cases being found in England, and in gay and bisexual men. Earlier this month the  World Health Organisation  (WHO) warned that festivals in Europe this summer could act as super spreading events for the disease.  Thousands of people queued at the entrance to the farm yesterday morning, eager to start five days of partying and ready to enjoy a star-studded line-up of music acts including headliners Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar.  And the first day saw crowds bathed in glorious sunshine, as the British summer welcomed revellers back to Somerset for the first time since 2019. People both young and old and from all parts of the UK - and some even from abroad - descended on the farm near Shepton Mallet, powering through the ongoing national rail strike that has paralysed train networks across the country. Dressed in brightly coloured clothes and enjoying the festival atmosphere, those who got there early showed no signs of letting the strike ruin their good mood. The festival's main stage will not open until Friday, with headliner  Billie Eilish  set for the iconic Pyramid Stage followed by Sir  Paul McCartney  on Saturday and rapper Kendrick Lamar bringing the event to a close on Sunday. However, DJs and live music is planned from today for eager fans who have arrived at the site early - as more than 200,000 people are expected to descend at Glastonbury over the next two days. A couple embrace in the sunset at Worthy Farm in Somerset yesterday as the first day of Glastonbury Festival 2022 got underway  Festival goers, dressed in suitable clothing for the glorious sunshine, walk through the camp as they look to soak in the atmosphere Hundreds of people gathered to sit on one of the hills at the festival as they made the most of the sunshine before forecasted rain later this weekend Festivalgoers take advantage of the Great Western Railway network to head to Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm Festivalgoers near the festival sign on day one of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 22 At the first Glastonbury since 2019, Ed proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea as the sun begins to set on the first day of the festival Revellers watch the sun go down on the first official day of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 22 Thousands of people arrived at the festival yesterday, with more than 20,000 people expected to attend the five-day-long extravaganza The Pyramid stage, which will host the likes of Sir Paul McCartney and Billie Eilish over the weekend, looms in the distance amid a sea of tents Festivalgoers gather around Pride-themed artwork at Worthy Farm on the first day of the first Glastonbury Festival since 2019 Festivalgoers wasted no time setting up their tents in the massive campsite, which is expected to host around 20,000 people throughout the weekend Groups of friends from all over the UK have come to the festival, powering through the national rail strike which has caused travel chaos But those in attendance have been warned to enjoy themselves responsibly and be mindful of the increasing number of monkeypox cases in the UK.  A spokesperson for the UKHSA said: 'Festival-goers should also be aware that there is currently transmission of monkeypox in the UK. 'The infection mainly spreads between people through direct (skin to skin) contact, including sexual contact, or close contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with the monkeypox virus. 'If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don't go to events, meet with friends, or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. 'If you have been advised to self-isolate, please continue to do so and you should not attend the festival without prior clearance from the relevant health authority.' Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Europe regional director, said earlier this month that the resumption of international travel and events such as festivals had allowed disease to spread.  'Rapid, amplified transmission has occurred in the context of the recent lifting of pandemic restrictions on international travel and events,' he said. He added the current outbreak was the 'largest and most geographically widespread' ever reported, with Europe at its 'epicentre'.  'Many – but not all cases – report fleeting and/or multiple sexual partners, sometimes associated with large events or parties,' he added. The glorious sunshine was welcomed by festivalgoers who might have been expecting the classic British summer weather of torrential rain. This woman raises her shirt as she gets sprayed with water by a festival worker to cool down People both young and old have come to the festival.

Organisers told fans they could begin parking at the site from 4pm on Tuesday after trains and Tube services were disrupted for a second day running - forcing revellers to get to Worthy Farm early to beat the rush.  The founder of the Somerset festival Michael Eavis was pictured officially opening the gate to Glastonbury this morning marking the official start of the four-day music spectacular. The festival is returning for its 50th anniversary after a three-year hiatus due to Covid-19.  Eavis and his daughter Emily were stood at one of the festival's many entry points and clapped as the first attendees entered the site. Eavis, 86, told those entering the gates: 'This is going to be the best show in town. Wait and see. You better believe it.' Huge crowds of revellers were pictured sitting on camping chairs by metal railings as they secured their spot in line to the entrance of the festival. Armed with camping gear and cool boxes, excited fans waited patiently as they queued to get in to the UK's most-anticipated music event of the year as they were met with glorious 19C (66F) sunshine - a pleasant change from the usual rain that marks the start of the muddy festival.  Festivalgoers have defied the national rail strikes crippling the UK's transport system and threats of camping in torrential rain to make it to Glastonbury's Worthy Farm for the first time since before Covid (pictured arriving on Wednesday) This year's Glastonbury festival is the first since summer 2019, and revellers are ready to enjoy the star-studded line-up of music acts including headliners Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar over the course of the weekend.

but this morning roads to the site were gridlocked with traffic.  Emily Eavis has said it is an 'amazing feeling' to see people returning to Glastonbury festival. The music event has opened its gates this morning, signalling its return for the first time in three years after it was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Lauren Laverne on 6 Music, she said of the gates opening: 'I mean, I'm still recovering because the build up has just been so long, we've never had a build up as long as this, obviously. 'We've never all collectively been through such an extreme time together, so it's like, to actually be able to see people there and welcome them in and just watch them streaming in and just running to pitch their tents up and fill the fields, it's just an amazing feeling.'

'Everyone is appreciating it so, so much... everyone is just still beaming because they are so pleased, everyone is so chuffed to be back so it's a totally unique atmosphere, I just can't wait to get everyone in here.' Shortly before the gates opened, radio host Jo Whiley said Glastonbury is the 'ultimate festival' and that Sir Paul McCartney's headlining slot on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday night is a 'very, very important and significant performance'. The former Beatle, 80, will become the music festival's oldest ever solo headliner when he takes to the stage this weekend.

Ahead of the five-day event, meteorologist Tom Morgan from the Met Office told the PA news agency, this year's weather outlook promises to be 'one of two halves'. Temperatures could reach 27C at the 900-acre site - 9C higher than usual - in the lead-up to the world-famous event. However, the mud synonymous with Glastonbury is still set to make an appearance, with showers and thunderstorms predicted from Friday onwards. To the dismay of many festival-goers the event coincides with three days of planned major rail strikes over rail workers' pay, leading to travel disruption for people making their way to Worthy Farm. Just 60% of trains will run across Wednesday, with walkouts planned for Thursday and Saturday. This year's much-anticipated festival, running from Wednesday to Sunday, will host huge stars from Diana Ross and Sir Paul McCartney, to Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Olivia Rodrigo.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10943621/Glastonbury-revellers-warned-monkeypox-danger-health-chiefs-event-returns-three-years.html"},
{"title": "NYC opens THREE mass vaccination centers for monkeypox with each able to dish out 1,400 doses a day — but jabs STILL run out within an hour: US cases of tropical virus reach 2,891", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 19:09, 25 July 2022 ", "text": "New York City  unveiled three mass vaccination centers for  monkeypox  Friday with each able to dish out 1,400 doses a day — but appointments at each site ran out within an hour, signaling the high demand for the jabs. The vaccine centers are based in Brooklyn, Bronx and the Queens and began rolling out doses this Sunday. They will roll out the rest this weekend. The Big Apple is running the largest inoculation drive for gay or bisexual men in the country, with only Washington D.C. also aiming to jab the group. Those who got at the Brooklyn center yesterday said they had just 'got lucky', adding they knew many others waiting for doses. There is mounting concern that monkeypox could spill over into other groups — including children, older adults and pregnant women — which are more vulnerable to the disease. It does not require sex to be transmitted, and can be spread through physical contact such as touching others or a hug. Cases in America are starting to surge as well, reaching 2,891 over the weekend as officials fear case counts are only picking up a fraction of the true number of Americans that have been infected so far. NYC has opened three mass vaccination centers in Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens with each able to dish out about 1,400 doses a day. City health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan is pictured at the mass vaccination center in Brooklyn Each center can give out between 75 and 85 doses at once, a spokesman for the New York Department of Health said Pictured above are the vaccination tablesin the vaccination center, set up in an old spots hall Appointments ran out within an hour of going live on Friday, several publications reported. There are growing calls for New York to secure more doses This Friday the city's Department of Health announced it was opening up appointments for another 17,000 doses of the vaccine. The appointments opened at 6 p.m., but an hour-and-a-half later health officials tweeted they had all been booked. Several papers reported they were full in an hour. Ondrea Didier, a resident in Chelsea, was one individual who 'got lucky' after securing a dose at the mass vaccination center in Flatbush. Previous 1 Next             They told  CBS New York : 'There would be one appointment in the Bronx or something, and then that would be gone. There'd be one in Staten Island, that would be gone.  'I don't know how I got this appointment. I just got lucky.' Vincent Vega, a Harlem resident who also secured a dose at the center, said: 'I didn't care where it was going to be. 'I know that, obviously this is a serious thing and a lot of people didn't take Covid very seriously, especially people around me. 'They're like, \"oh, it's not gonna be that bad\", and two years later we're wishing we were more cautious.' The mass vaccination sites are able to deliver between 75 and 85 doses at once, a spokesman for the health department told DailyMail.com. They are an echo of the Covid vaccination drive, when mass centers were doling out thousands of doses a day in an attempt to protect everyone against the virus. Announcing the opening of the centers on Friday, NYC's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said: 'The Health Department is moving quickly to distribute as many vaccine doses as we can in the most equitable way possible. 'With cases rising, it's clear that there is a great need for more vaccine in New York City, and we are working with our federal partners to obtain more doses.' Pictured above are men lining up to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine in Brooklyn yesterday Men wait in line to receive a dose of the monkeypox vaccine in Brooklyn New York received another 26,000 doses last week, with another 9,000 held back to offer to people who are close contacts of known cases. Its roll out has been repeatedly slammed for failing to offer enough doses, and problems with its vaccination booking system. Last month the Health Department told residents to not try to book doses until late in the afternoon when slots would become available. But a 'technical glitch' saw some residents given early access to the slots, meaning they were almost fully booked before they went online. Concerns have also been raised by the city's decision to delay second doses, in order to provide primary inoculations. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration have warned against the move, saying it has not yet been properly tested.  It comes amid mounting concern that the virus will spill over into other groups that are more vulnerable. On Friday it was revealed that two children had tested positive for monkeypox. Although health officials said both were 'doing well', medics say children under eight years old are generally more at risk from the virus.  Two children have tested positive for monkeypox in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed Friday. One is a toddler from California; the other is in an infant who is not a U.S. resident and was 'transiting through' Washington D.C. Neither had contact with each other. Health officials said both children were 'doing well', but warned children under the age of eight are at high risk of severe monkeypox. It is thought both children likely caught the virus from 'household contacts'. Dr Rochelle Walensky said the children both had contact with gay or bisexual men — the community where most cases are being detected in the current outbreak. It was not clear when they caught the virus, or what symptoms they suffered. They are receiving the antiviral TPOXX, which can help stop an infection in its tracks by interfering with the virus's maturation. They are the first cases among children to be detected in America. There are currently more than 2,500 cases of monkeypox in the U.S. — the second biggest outbreak in the world behind only Spain with 3,000. : Monkeypox is discovered when an outbreak of pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : First human case of the disease is recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was later detected in a number of other central and western African countries. : America's former largest monkeypox outbreak occurs. A total of 47 people are infected after having contact with pet prairie dogs that picked up the disease at a farm. : Monkeypox case detected in the U.S. in a citizen who had recently returned from Nigeria.  : Monkeypox is detected in another U.S. resident who recently returned from Nigeria. : A man in Massachusetts is diagnosed with monkeypox, becoming the first case in the current outbreak. There are now more than 2,000 cases nationwide.  A boy under 10 years old tested positive for the virus in the Netherlands in June, as was revealed this week. The Dutch child suffered more than 20 red lesions on his face, forearms and thighs but had no fever or swollen lymph nodes — with the infection mostly clearing within a week. Revealing the infections at a virtual event for the Washington Post, Walensky said: 'We have seen now two cases that have occurred in children. 'Both of these are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community, the gay men's community.' She added that these cases have been on the whole 'adjacent to the community most at risk'. In a press release, the agency said: 'CDC and public health authorities are still investigating how the children became infected. 'While both children have monkeypox symptoms, they are in good health.' They added: 'Monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which — in the case of children — could include hugging, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups and utensils.' Last week the CDC said it was only aware of monkeypox infections among adults, mostly in gay or bisexual men. Until now monkeypox infections have been almost exclusively among gay or bisexual men. But a top expert warned last week the virus had likely already spread to other groups, but that this was yet to be detected due to a lack of testing. The World Health Organization warns that children — as well as older people and pregnant women — are more at risk from monkeypox. Scientific studies suggest that between three and ten percent of children infected with monkeypox die from the disease, depending on the strain they catch. In the Dutch case, doctors said they counted 20 lesions on the face, ear, forearms, thighs and back of the child — but that he did not suffer a fever or swollen lymph nodes. Within a week the virus in his body had dropped to non-detectable levels, they added. It was not clear how he became infected, although doctors said he likely had contact with an infected person or contaminated object that 'was not recognized'. Monkeypox primarily spreads through close physical contact or towels or bedsheets that have also been used by a patient. In rare cases, it can also be transmitted through the air. The CDC has been repeatedly slammed for its response to the virus, with testing initially being slow to get off the ground masking the spread of the virus. There have also been problems rolling out the vaccine, with New York City — at the epicenter of the crisis — having to delay second doses for patients because too few jabs have been supplied.  ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11046817/NYC-opens-THREE-mass-vaccination-centers-monkeypox-able-dish-1-400-doses-day.html"},

Dr Rochelle Walensky also claimed in a statement that it was still possible to 'significantly decrease' infections thanks to more testing — with about 10,000 swabs carried out a day — more vaccines, and more awareness. Walensky's comments came after Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that the window to get a handle on the tropical disease had likely already closed. Firing a broadside at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he also accused the agency of repeating the same mistakes as when Covid first arrived. Dr Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told DailyMail.com today it was not yet clear whether the disease was out of control — although this should emerge in the coming weeks thanks to ramped up testing. America currently has about 1,900 cases of monkeypox — up from 500 two weeks ago — but many experts fear there are already several thousand. Dr Rochelle Walensky, who heads up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), claimed it was 'misinformed' to say monkeypox was already out of control. But Dr Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, made the warning this weekend as case numbers continued to accelerate Insisting monkeypox could still be contained, Walensky said in a statement emailed to DailyMail.com: '(Gottlieb's) interview was misinformed and off base. 'It's true that we have work to do — here and internationally — and are likely to see more monkeypox cases in the near term. 'But it is possible to significantly decrease the number of cases and contain the current monkeypox outbreak through education and increased testing and access to vaccines — all priorities we've made dramatic progress on.' Walensky also said the CDC was now carrying out 80,000 swabs for monkeypox a week, up from 6,000 when the disease first emerged in early May. Previous 1 Next             She also claimed credit for the vaccine roll out, which has been repeatedly criticized for being too slow to get doses to people. America has faced three outbreaks of monkeypox in the past, with each being successfully contained. The largest was in 2003 when 47 people caught the virus from infected pet prairie dogs. But the current outbreak differs from the others in that the disease is spreading following close contact during sex, particularly among gay and bisexual men. Warning Sunday that monkeypox was likely out of control, Gottlieb told  CBS : 'I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. 'If it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close.' He added: 'We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases because we had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested. New York City is set to delay rolling out second doses of the monkeypox vaccine because it has too few doses, health officials say amid warnings the U.S. outbreak is already out of control. The city's Department of Health warned Friday it would likely be unable to meet this deadline because it has received too few doses from the federal government. Guidance states patients should receive their second dose of the jab four weeks after the first to ensure best protection.  New York — which is at the epicenter of the outbreak — has switched track to prioritize getting first doses to as many patients as possible. It is also releasing the 1,000 doses it initially held back for second shots. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears over a vaccine shortage telling STAT News that New York City was among those set to receive yet more deliveries. Dr Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said it was 'not recommended' to delay second doses. 'By and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. 'So we're looking there, we're finding cases there, but it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now. We're not picking them up because we are not looking there.' Gottlieb also compared the response to monkeypox to that against Covid, saying the U.S. was making 'a lot of the same mistakes'. He pointed to a lack of testing early on and too few vaccines being made available quickly as warning signs that lessons had not been learned. Initially, the CDC was carrying out barely 100 tests a day nationwide while it struggled to hammer out deals with commercial laboratories. This has now risen to more than 10,000, but many medics are still saying they are having trouble accessing the tests because patients do not meet the criteria to be eligible. Several cities — particularly New York — are also facing issues getting hold of the monkeypox vaccine. New York is currently offering the jab to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. It is releasing batches of up to 9,000 appointments at a time, but these are being booked out within minutes. Supplies are so low that the city has also shelved plans for second doses — due four weeks after a first jab — in favour of inoculating as many people as possible. Residents have blasted the roll out of so few vaccines as 'ridiculous' considering the city has a population of more than eight million. And local politicians have also slammed the health department for failing to take action quickly to curb the outbreak. Hanage says it is still unclear whether the monkeypox outbreak could be contained. 'There's more testing available now thanks to the likes of labcorp, and it remains to be seen exactly how large the iceberg of undetected transmission chains is now we are looking for them,' he told DailyMail.com. 'That will determine whether it can be contained.' He also agreed with Gottlieb that the CDC appeared to be repeating many of the same mistakes it made during the early days of Covid.  'I think (Gottlieb) is right to comment that there are points of comparison in the response. Slow testing roll out for instance,' he said. 'I know from colleagues that they've struggled to get tests for patients with lesions that would be considered \"suspicious\".' Monkeypox cases have spiraled in recent days after the CDC ramped up testing for the virus, allowing it to break through the backlog. But it can take several days to diagnose a case after symptoms appear, because the tests rely on swabbing pustules which only appear in the later stages of infection. This leaves a window during which someone could unwittingly spread the infection to others.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11028137/CDC-chief-insists-monkeypox-not-control-United-States.html"},

At least 120 Monkeypox carriers have required hospitalisation in Spain, reported El Mundo, representing 3.2 per cent of cases, as one expert warned more deaths can be expected. It comes after a 'middle aged' man from Alicante, in the Valencia region, became the first death in Europe on Friday.  He has not been identified but health authorities said he died from encephalitis associated with the disease, a serious condition which causes the brain to become swollen.  It followed the death a 41-year-old male in Brazil. He had serious immune system complications and was hospitalised at the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, at the time of his death Thursday. Eight deaths have now been reported as part of the outbreak, with five occurring in African nations where the virus is endemic Monkeypox has affected more than 16,000 people across 75 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Several countries have now begun launching vaccination drives aimed at men who have sex with men, who continue to be the most at risk group (Pictured: Long queue forms at Guy's Hospital in central London on Saturday) Eight deaths have now been reported as part of the outbreak, with five occurring in African nations where the virus is endemic.  Experts in Spain said the strain of the virus currently plaguing the country is from Nigeria and is less fatal than those seen in other parts of the continent. But Alfredo Corell, professor of Immunology at the University of Valladolid warned: 'We are facing the possibility of seeing more deaths.'  While the average age of patients in Spain is 37, the age of those who have been infected range from 10 months old to 88.  Several countries have now begun launching vaccination drives aimed at men who have sex with men, who continue to be the most at risk group.  Huge queues for a walk-in jab service were pictured at Guy's Hospital in central London on Saturday, with similar scenes witnessed last weekend.  It comes after sexual health services, particularly in the capital, have been forced to cut back or even suspend walk-ins and other services as they struggle to cope with being on the frontlines of the outbreak.  Previous 1 Next             People queue up to receive monkeypox vaccinations during a pop-up clinic at Guy's Hospital in central London on July 30, 2022 Last week the World Health Organisation declared Monkeypox a global health emergency, meaning it now views the current outbreak as enough of a significant threat that a coordinated international response is needed.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the decision to issue the declaration despite a lack of consensus among experts serving on the U.N. health agency's emergency committee. It was the first time the chief of the U.N. health agency has taken such an action. 'We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,' Tedros said. 'I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members of the committee,' he added. The WHO announcement came after the virus spread to more than 75 countries. Director General Dr Tedros said at the time the risk of people catching the virus in Europe was 'high'. The WHO previously declared emergencies for public health crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus in Latin America in 2016 and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio. Although Monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades, it was not known to spread beyond the continent or to move widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of individual outbreaks in Europe, North America and elsewhere.  Traditionally, people with Monkeypox have developed a fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and muscle aches. The symptoms are followed by a rash that starts on their face or mouth and then spreads to other parts of their body - particularly the hands and feet.  However, in some recent cases, patients first experienced a rash in the mouth or around the genitals or anus.  Anyone can spread Monkeypox, but the current outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated almost exclusively among men who have sexual intercourse with men. The virus spreads primarily via intimate skin-to-skin contact, usually with someone who has an active rash, as well as via contact with contaminated clothes or bedding. It is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the COVID-19 pandemic. 'COVID is spread by respiratory route and is highly infectious. This doesn't appear to be the case with the Monkeypox,' said Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11064419/Second-Monkeypox-death-announced-Spain.html"},
{"title": "Former FDA chief says its still possible to get monkeypox outbreak 'back in the box' but that testing needs to be extended beyond just gay and bisexual men: US reaches 7,510 confirmed infections over weekend", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 16:37, 8 August 2022 ", "text": "Despite the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaring  monkeypox  a public health emergency last week, one key expert is still hopeful that the virus can be contained before it develops into a full fledged outbreak. Dr Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and current board member at pharma-giant  Pfizer , told  CBS' Face the Nation  on Sunday that while difficult, it is possible to prevent monkeypox from becoming an endemic virus - a prospect officials likely failed with Covid. He says that the response to the virus has to be wider to control it, though. At the moment, testing has mainly been reserved to just gay and bisexual men - who make up a overwhelming majority of cases. Gottlieb believes that more cases would be found if testing was expanded beyond just that community. His comments come days after HHS declared a public health emergency over the virus on Thursday. The 7,510 recorded cases are the most of any country in the world so far. Per capita, the nation's one case per million residents on August 5 is around half of the 1.93 per million cases being recorded in  Spain . One of these cases is among a daycare worker in Illinois. The unnamed employee in Eastern Illinois tested positive recently, potentially exposing the vulnerable children at the facility to the virus. Officials are screening children and staff for the virus and offering the potentially exposed the Jynneos vaccine. Previous 1 Next             ‘There’s a potential to get this back in the box but its going to be very difficult at this point,' Gottlieb said.  'We’re continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men, its primarily spreading in that community, but there's no question it has spread outside that community at this point and I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly.’ While exact federal data is not available, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that they still make up a majority of cases. Former FDA Chief Dr Scott Gottlieb (pictured) told CBS' Face the Nation that the CDC should expand monkeypox testing and launch wastewater surveillance for the virus In mid-July, New York City officials revealed that 95 percent of cases in the Big Apple - the nation's monkeypox hotspot - were is men with at least three-in-five also identifying as gay, bisexual or lesbian. America is facing a shortage of both testing and vaccines at the moment, though, meaning that they have been reserved for men who have sex with other men to this point. The CDC has greatly expanded its testing capacity in recent weeks, now being able to perform 80,000 per week across its own testing and agreements set up with private partners. Last week Walensky said that only around ten percent of America's testing capacity was being used, opening the door for significant expansions in the amount of people that should be tested. Gottlieb said that any person with an atypical case of either shingles or herpes should be tested for monkeypox at this point. Expanding testing will either find more cases - giving officials more information they can use to control the outbreak - or will confirm more people as negative and confirm areas where the virus is not spreading. He also believes the CDC should begin wastewater surveillance - which can give more general pictures of where the virus is spreading without individual testing. Despite his concerns, Gottlieb does not think the virus has reached a point where the average American should be worried. ‘I don’t think this is something people need to be generally worried about,' he explained.  'I think the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. Your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is still exceedingly low outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate.  'If you want to contain it… we need to start looking more widely for it.’  The U.S. has confirmed 7,510 cases of the virus since it was first found stateside in May. Another 408 cases were added to the ledger over the weekend. Not a single death has been tied to the virus in the U.S., though nearly a dozen have internationally as part of this current outbreak. New York has far and away recorded the most cases of any U.S. state. The Empire State has logged 1,862 as of Monday morning. No other state has logged more than 1,000. Wyoming remains the lone state not to have recorded a monkeypox infection, though this could be due to a lack of surveillance in the state.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11092149/Former-FDA-chief-says-possible-monkeypox-outbreak-box.html"},

The city's Department of Health revealed it has now spotted 119 infections with the tropical disease, up by half on the same time seven days ago. Before the Pride weekend concerns were raised that the events — which drew crowds numbering more than 2 million — could spread monkeypox. In San Francisco officials have already linked several Pride-themed parties in nightclubs to outbreaks of the disease. America has recorded 605 cases of monkeypox to date, with most in New York, California and Florida. No deaths have been reported. Experts warned before the Pride weekend that people should avoid skin-to-skin contact where possible, which is how the virus transmits. But health officials mostly brushed them under the carpet, with little attempt made to put out posters or have boots on the ground warning people over the disease. Just 1,000 doses of a monkeypox vaccine were rolled out — in a city of 8.3million — before the event, which was branded as 'ridiculous'. Previous 1 2 Next                   Experts are warning that gaps in testing and vaccine coverage will leave the United States vulnerable to losing control of the monkeypox outbreak. Public health leaders from the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSD) and George Washington University (GW) say that the response is 'fractured' which is likely to have 'severe consequences'. Previously, they have warned that the virus has likely been spreading undetected in the U.S. for some time, and fear it could become endemic in the nation is not curbed soon. 'Where we have lagged is streamlining testing, making vaccines available, streamlining access to the best therapeutics,' David Harvey, executive director of the NCSD told The Hill. 'All three areas have been bureaucratic and slow, and that means we haven't contained this outbreak.' Health officials in the city are yet to reveal whether any Pride events have been linked to outbreaks of monkeypox. But in San Francisco — where Pride celebrations were attended by an estimated 1.7million people — cases have already been traced back to two events. People who went to Afterglow about nine days ago were warned over potential exposure to monkeypox Monday. The following day Electroluxx — a large party attended mostly by gay men — also revealed that at least one attendee had since tested positive for the tropical disease. There are mounting concerns among experts that monkeypox is now 'out of control' in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently carrying out little more than a hundred tests for the virus every 24 hours. It has now signed on a commercial lab that could do more than 1,000 a day, although it is unclear when it will reach this number. Experts say that the poor testing regime is leaving many cases undetected, raising the risk they could spread monkeypox to others. Vaccines are being rolled out to gay or bisexual men who have sex with multiple partners every fortnight in New York city and Washington D.C. to stem the outbreak. Yesterday New York began offering 6,000 more slots for being jabbed against the tropical disease. But within hours the slots filled up once again amid high demand, leaving many trying to get the vaccine empty-handed. The roll out also faced a 'technical glitch', with some able to book their jabs early while others were locked out of the system. It comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed it would re-convene to consider whether to declare the outbreak an international emergency. Top officials at the agency met last week, but decided not to hit the panic button. However, cases have now climbed to more than 6,000 globally across at least 40 countries, with concerns mounting the disease could spill over into more at risk groups including older people and those with underlying health conditions. Only one death has been reported so far in Nigeria, although there are fears this number could yet rise. Revealing the decision to re-convene, WHO director Tedros Ghebreyesus said they were aiming to meet again in the week of July 18.

'We apologize for the frustration caused and are working to build stable appointment infrastructure as we roll out more appointments as vaccine supply increases in the coming weeks.'  To date, New York City has administered nearly 7,000 vaccinations, while thousands more have been waiting for their chance to get inoculated against the virus.  Health officials said they were expecting 14,500 doses this week. New York City comic Jay Jurden, pictured, said he was particularly concerned that the city couldn't even get the online appointment process to work As of Wednesday, 336 people in New York City have tested positive for orthopoxvirus, a category of disease that includes smallpox.  That's a fourth more than the day before, according to city data.  Officials said they were fairly certain that all of the new cases are likely monkeypox and that many more cases remain undiagnosed. Learning from its experience with the rollout of COVID vaccines, Washington, D.C., is allowing residents to preregister for vaccination appointments.  As many as 3,000 slots were to open sometime Thursday, officials said. As news of the outbreak spread, Jeff Waters asked his doctor to be vaccinated before the Baltimore man left for a trip to Europe, where cases have been rising. 'They said 'Sorry, we just don't have them here,'' Waters recalled. Weeks later, the first signs of a monkeypox hit him while at dinner with a friend. He developed terrible headaches, a 102-degree (38.9-degree Celsius) fever, and intense chills. 'I feel grateful. I had a mild case,' Waters said. New York City is giving priority for the vaccine to men who have had anonymous sex with other men or who have had multiple partners over the past two weeks. Symptoms include rashes or sores that resemble pimples or blisters. They can sometimes be painful but usually not fatal.  Most people don't require hospitalization and recover within two to four weeks. Infections spread by direct contact with rashes, scabs or body fluids, according the CDC. It can spread through kissing, sex and body contact. In some cases, prolonged face-to-face exposure, as well as unwashed laundry contaminated by the virus, could lead to infection.

A surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic.  Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The first British monkeypox patient to go public is an HR manager from London who caught the virus after being deported from Dubai for testing positive for HIV, MailOnline can reveal.  James M, 35, has spoken out after claiming that health chiefs still haven't contacted him despite being diagnosed with monkeypox nearly a fortnight ago. He slammed the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for 'a real lack of any basic process or care to stop the spread' of the tropical virus, which has so far infected more than 300 Britons, mostly gay and bisexual men. James — who wished to keep his surname anonymous — admitted he is not following self-isolation rules because 'I was told to stay home until UKHSA contacted me... and they never did.'  He accused the UK of having a lackadaisical approach to contact tracing, saying it was 'no wonder' Britain had more cases than any other country outside of Africa. There is also a lack of awareness about monkeypox's lesser-known symptoms, he claimed.  James was readjusting to life in west London when he began suffering from 'really weird aches' in his lower back, exhaustion, extreme thirst and pain when he used the toilet. He became convinced he had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) after sleeping with around 10 new partners in the weeks before his symptoms started.  'I'm a gay man, and having just come back to the UK, I was having a good time,' he told MailOnline.  But medics wrongly assumed it wasn't monkeypox because he didn't have the virus' tell-tale rash.  James M, 35, has become the first British monkeypox patient to go public On June 23, the WHO convened an emergency committee (EC) of experts to decide if monkeypox constitutes a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) - the UN health agency's highest alert level. But a majority advised the Tedros that the situation, at that point, had not met the threshold. The second meeting was called on Thursday with case numbers rising further, where Tedros said he was worried. 'I need your advice in assessing the immediate and mid-term public health implications,' Tedros told the meeting, which lasted more than six hours. WHO's top monkeypox expert, Dr. Rosamund Lewis, said this week that 99 per cent of all the monkeypox cases beyond Africa were in men and that of those, 98 per cent involved men who have sex with men.  Experts suspect the monkeypox outbreaks in Europe and North America were spread via sex at two raves in Belgium and Spain. 'Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern for the moment, this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,' Tedros said.  'That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.' Emergencies chief Ryan, explained what preceded the director-general's decision: '(Tedros) found that the committee did not reach a consensus, despite having a very open, very useful, very considered debate on the issues, and that since he's not going against the committee, what he's recognizing is that there are deep complexities in this issue,' Ryan said.  'There are uncertainties on all sides. And he's reflecting that uncertainty and his determination of the event to be a global emergency.' A US health expert sounded a grim warning late Friday. 'Since the last #monkeypox EC just weeks ago we've seen an exponential rise in cases,' Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said on Twitter. 'It's inevitable that cases will dramatically rise in the coming weeks & months. That's why @DrTedros must sound the global alarm.' 'A failure to act will have grave consequences for global health.' The European Union's drug watchdog on Friday recommended for approval the use of Imnavex, a smallpox vaccine, to treat monkeypox. Imvanex, developed by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, has been approved in the EU since 2013 for the prevention of smallpox. It was also considered a potential vaccine for monkeypox because of the similarity between the monkeypox virus and the smallpox virus. A viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Ninety-five percent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity, according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the New England Journal of Medicine - the largest research to date. Overall, 98 percent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and around a third were known to have visited sex-on-site venues such as sex parties or saunas within the previous month. The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days. Rashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11041513/WHO-set-declare-spread-monkeypox-global-health-emergency-highest-alarm-sound.html"},
{"title": "EXCLUSIVE: Have monkeypox fears been overblown? Tropical virus may be up to 30 TIMES less deadly than originally stated as outbreak continues to sweep the world", "author": "John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline", "date": " 17:06, 11 July 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  may be less deadly than originally feared, scientists claimed today.   The tropical virus was predicted to kill roughly one in every 100 people struck down as it swept through Europe earlier this year. But after roughly 9,000 cases around the world over the past few months, only three deaths have been recorded. It means monkeypox has a fatality rate of around 0.03 per cent, around 30 times less than first mooted when the outbreak kicked off.  Furthermore, all three of the deaths have occurred in African nations where the virus is considered endemic. No fatalities have been reported elsewhere, despite the current outbreak having now reached 70 countries. The virus, which causes a similar rash to its cousin smallpox, is spreading predominately in gay and bisexual men. Scientists claim better testing and healthcare in the countries experiencing the new outbreaks will be responsible. Virologists have also stated the virus itself could have mutated to be less severe.  The latest data shows there are currently 1,552 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, 201 more than the last report.  The majority of which have been in London but the virus has been spotted in all parts of the nation. The UK's outbreak has been eclipsed by Spain's which has now topped 2,000 cases A total of 9,109 monkeypox cases have been spotted around the world so far in 2022 with 70 countries reporting confirmed or suspected cases This WHO and Pan American Health Organization chart breaks down the nearly 8,00 cases reported as of  July 7 by region. It shows the vast majority of confirmed cases have been identified in Europe (salmon coloured bars) and the Americas (light blue bars) Previous 1 Next                         : Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. : The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. : A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. : Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. : A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. : A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. : A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. : Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. : A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. Experts have suggested the virus was spreading in the UK for months before this case was spotted. : Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. : Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The UKHSA first confirms that the spate of cases, described as 'unusual' and 'surprising', are mainly among gay and bisexual men and advises them to look out for new rashes. : Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. : Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them : Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland log their first ever monkeypox cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) says risk of monkeypox is 'moderate', citing concerns about virus infecting children and immunosuppressed people if it becomes more widespread. : The UKHSA declares monkeypox a notifiable disease. It means all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases. The tropical virus now carries the same legal status as the plague, rabies and measles. Monkeypox went from a little-known tropical disease to a household topic earlier this year when the global outbreak began to take off.  Britain, the first country to raise the alarm, has now recorded 1,500 cases. London is the hotspot, accounting for 62 per cent of all known infections. Only six patients are known to be women. In its latest update on the virus, published on Friday, the UKHSA said there had been 6,027 cases and three deaths (two in the Central African Republic and one in Nigeria) reported around the globe as of July 6.  But more up-to-date estimates claim the actual number of cases sits in the region of 9,000. The West African variant, behind the current spread, has an estimated fatality rate of 1 per cent, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) analysis of previous outbreaks. If this proportion had come to pass, the world would have seen up to 90 monkeypox fatalities by now. It can, however, take time for infected patients to become severely ill and feed into the death numbers. The 1 per cent figure relates to the virus' case-fatality rate, meaning it only takes into account diagnosed patients.  Better testing in Britain and other countries experiencing the outbreak is one reason why the mortality rate is lower than originally thought. Experts have also speculated that gay and bisexual men have more awareness of, and get checked more regularly for, sexually transmitted infections. Monkeypox's current case fatality-rate, based on the known 9,000 patients, roughly equates to 0.03 per cent — similar to that for flu and Covid. The infection-fatality rate, which considers everyone who catches the virus, is always lower.  Experts still do not know monkeypox's true infection-fatality rate but argue it will be even lower, given that thousands of cases are likely to have flown under the radar in the current outbreak.   Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'Quoted death rates for monkeypox are based on rates in endemic African countries.' As well as less testing, he added that they tend to have poorer access to high quality healthcare and high rates of poorly controlled HIV infection.  'Another point is in Democratic Republic of the Congo (one of the African countries where the virus is endemic), most deaths are in people who have malaria as well as monkeypox,' he added.  'Also in Africa, many cases are in children and some evidence that children are more likely to suffer severe disease.'   Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, also said the different health standards in countries like the UK and developing African nations could be behind the low number of deaths.     'These infections are generally in young fit people living in countries where a rapid response is available, so the case fatality rate is much less than predicted,' he said.  Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, also agreed that differing health systems could be behind the lower than the expected fatality rate.  He said: 'The estimates are predominantly in populations in Africa who will not have had access to testing, tracing and vaccination,' he said. 'It is also possible increased surveillance and contact tracing along with vaccination is providing protection from severe disease.'  However, he added that there could be other factors at play, including that a stealth strain of monkeypox could have been spreading that only sprung to light this year after it mutated. 'The virus itself carries at least 40 mutations compared to strains that were around in 2018,' he said.  'These changes may suggest the virus has been circulating at a low level for several years and could have evolved to become more infectious but less pathogenic.'  Monkeypox is not normally considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through touching contaminated clothing, bedding or towels, or by interacting with infected animals.  The prevalence of the outbreak in gay or bisexual men prompted the UKHSA to urge Pride attendees earlier this month to watch out for the tell-tale blister-like spots and rashes to stop passing the disease on to others. Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic The infection often starts with small bumps that scab over and are contagious People with tell-tale symptoms, which can also include having a fever and swollen lymph nodes, are advised to contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service for help.  As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts of infected are being offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85 per cent effective against the virus. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work. Anyone infected with monkeypox is also advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11002053/Monkeypox-30-TIMES-deadly-originally-stated.html"},

The nation's hotspot was blasted last week after offering barely a thousand doses just days before the Pride weekend, with supply being so small that walk-ins were suspended just 90 minutes after the clinic opened. But now Gov Kathy Hochul has announced thousands more doses are earmarked for the city, which will be offered to the most at risk gay and bisexual men who are close contacts of cases or have multiple sexual partners in a fortnight. New York City has recorded 78 cases of the tropical virus, the most out of any city in the United States and 20 percent of the national tally. It came as the U.S. today ordered another 2.5 million doses of the Jynneous jab against the tropical disease, bringing its total to 4.4 million. The extra doses are expected to start arriving from October this year, and will then be made available to states to broaden inoculation efforts. Another 45 infections were confirmed across America yesterday with the tropical disease now spotted in as many as 28 states. Michigan is the latest to report monkeypox in a patient who is now isolating at home. No deaths from the rash-causing virus have been reported in America, but one fatality has been registered in Nigeria amid the global outbreak topping 5,000 cases. The above map shows monkeypox cases detected in America since the outbreak began. The table breaks this down by numbers, and also shows the number added in the last 24 hours More than a hundred men lined up outside the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic in Manhattan last Friday to get a dose of the monkeypox vaccine. The clinic only admitted people who had got appointments, and turned away all others Last week New York City opened a vaccination clinic for monkeypox without warning and made 1,000 doses available. But it had to stop offering doses by walk-in within 90 minutes and over appointment within hours after all slots were filled. People waiting at the clinic for the shot blasted the barely a thousand doses available as 'ridiculous' in a city of nearly eight million. Others accused officials of giving 'contradictory' information on how to get jabbed. Previous 1 Next             The first American  monkeypox  patient to go public with his battle against the tropical virus has slammed health officials for a 'lackluster' job of testing for the virus, which has left many cases undiagnosed. Matt Ford, a self-employed actor who splits his time between  Los Angeles  and New York City, has spoken out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should take it 'seriously.' He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Revealing his diagnosis to  Buzzfeed , Ford said he caught the virus after having 'skin-to-skin contact' with another patient. The actor and writer, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man,' revealed he initially noticed spots in and around his 'underwear zone,' which indicated to him he had caught the virus. Over the next few days they spread across the rest of his body, including his face, arms, hands and abdomen.  In total, he has counted 25 spots and said after appearing they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several — especially in the 'sensitive area' — became so painful they left him unable to sleep at night without taking painkillers. Chis LeBron, a Democrat candidate for the New York State Assembly, also weighed in criticizing the roll out as a last minute move ahead of the Pride weekend. New York City has got hold of the doses through the White House which has made another 56,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine available to states across America. It was not clear when the city would start offering people appointments for the jab again. It was also not clear how many doses have been secured by other states.  This two-dose jab is about 85 percent effective against infections, and sparks protection within minutes of receiving the first dose. America will make another 240,000 doses of the vaccine available in the coming weeks, with a further 750,000 set to come on stream by the end of this year. The U.S. today announced a further order of 2.5million Jynneous doses.  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said: 'This order of additional Jynneous vaccine will help us push out more vaccine quickly, knowing that we have more doses on the way in the coming months — and is only possible because of our longstanding investment in smallpox and monkeypox preparedness.'  There are also plans to offer around the million or so doses of the ACAM2000 jab, although this is not preferred because of its more severe side-effects. Both vaccines were designed to tackle smallpox, but health chiefs say they should work as well against monkeypox because the two viruses are closely related. New York City and Washington D.C. are the first two areas to begin rolling out the monkeypox vaccine to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners.  Revealing plans to roll out more monkeypox vaccines in New York City plus 2,000 in the wider state, Hochul said: 'In New York State, we have seen a disproportionate number of cases, especially for LGBTQ+ New Yorkers, which is why my team and I will continue to work around the clock to secure as many vaccines as possible for our residents.'  It comes after it was revealed that America's first monkeypox patient to come forward was a gay actor in Los Angeles who caught the infection after 'skin-to-skin' contact with another patient. Matt Ford, who lives between New York City and Los Angeles, spoke out to warn people that the disease 'sucks' and they should 'take it seriously'. He blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their poor testing efforts, saying it took officials three days to diagnose his illness by which point he 'already knew' what they would say. Matt Ford, from Los Angeles, is the first patient to come forward to talk about his monkeypox diagnosis. He is pictured above with three spots due to the virus on his face Ford showed spots on his stomach (left) and arm (right). There were about 25 in total, he said, that had erupted all over his body Revealing his diagnosis, Ford said he initially noticed spots appearing in his 'underwear zone' which then spread across the rest of his body including face, arms, hands and abdomen. The patient, who describes himself as a 'proud openly gay man' said he counted 25 spots on his body to date. After appearing he said they began to 'fill with puss' and became itchy. Several in the 'sensitive area' became so painful that they left him unable to sleep without painkillers. Ford also suffered flu-like symptoms in the early stages ranging from a fever, chills, night sweats and a cough.  He is now isolating at home with the symptoms having largely subsided, but will remain there until all the spots have scabbed over and the scabs have fallen off. The CDC was performing about 60 tests for monkeypox a day last week, leaving it unable to stay on top of the virus. But it has now sent more swabbing kits to private laboratories as it aims to ramp up testing to tens of thousands a day.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10973163/New-York-City-orders-6-000-doses-monkeypox-vaccine.html"},

NSW Health says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. 'People need to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, which can include fever, headache, body aches and a rash or lesions on the genital area,' NSW Health executive director of health protection Jeremy McAnulty said on Wednesday. Nine of the infections were acquired overseas but two may be local cases. Pictured: Perth Airport  Monkeypox can cause lesions and rashes on the skin as pictured above  He said the cases had not exhibited severe symptoms, such as an extensive rash or lesions all over the body. But Dr McAnulty warned even minor symptoms such as pimples in the genital area or buttocks needed to be taken seriously. Previous 1 Next             'The virus is mainly spread through skin to skin contact ... It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity.' 'It is important that people with symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity, as condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox.'  NSW Health says nine of the infections were probably acquired overseas but two may be local cases, which suggests community transmission could be occurring, especially among men who have sex with men. The disease can be transmitted through air droplets, close contact and sharing contaminated linen or objects. Pictured: Sydney  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection associated with travel to Central and West Africa. However, thousands of cases of monkeypox have been reported in Europe and the United States. The disease can be transmitted through air droplets, close contact and sharing contaminated linen or objects. Many of the cases have been among men who have sex with men. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. It is usually spread through direct contact with animals such as squirrels, which are known to harbour the virus. However, it can also be transmitted through very close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa until now and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. However it can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Monkeypox shuts down some aspects of your body's ability to fight infections. Because of the presence of other viruses and bacteria which your body can't fight off, in the worst cases patients can succumb to a lethal shock throughout the body and blood poisoning. Death is more likely to occur in younger patients. The skin lesions are painful and disfiguring, and can be the source of further infections. Because monkeypox is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. One vaccine, Imvanex, was shown to be around 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox infection. Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10987669/Monkeypox-outbreak-Australian-NSW-cases-rise-11-symptoms-revealed.html"},

There have been 53 cases of monkeypox reported in Australia and 25,000 across the world.  Australia currently has a stockpile of the ACAM2000 monkeypox vaccine, which can be used before or after exposure to the virus. Unlike other vaccines, people taking it are required to take precautions and cover the injection site until the scab falls off. There are also rare but serious side effects associated with it.  The alternative vaccine, known as JYNNEOS, which is a third generation vaccine, has fewer potential side effects, while also being easier to administer.  Health Minister Mark Butler has confirmed that the government has now secured additional doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, which can be used before or after exposure to monkeypox. 'We've secured supplies of new third generation vaccines,' he said in a statement. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has listed five key groups that are eligible for the vaccine. These include:   The federal government is set to make an announcement on Thursday about a monkeypox vaccine rollout in Australia (stock image) Further details about the vaccine rollout are set to be announced later today, but they will likely be administered by the states and territories to those vulnerable to the virus.

Identifiable symptoms include unusual rashes or lesions appearing on the skin.  People who contract monkeypox are required to isolate until their sores fully clear, which can be up to 21 days.  In May, NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant sent out a  warning for gay men in particular to watch out for symptoms and seek immediate help if concerned. In May, NSW's chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant sent out a warning for gay men in particular to watch out for the symptoms and seek immediate help if worried 'We know it's transmitted by that close skin to skin contact - you can be infectious and that close droplet contact in a very sort of close prolonged way,' Dr Chant said. 'We're particularly urging men who are gay or bisexual, or men who have sex with men, to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact by phone a sexual health clinic or GP without delay if they have any concerns.' The rare tropical disease is transmitted through close physical contact. It has been predominant amongst men who have sex with men (stock image) Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above) Heath Paynter, acting CEO of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, commended the Commonwealth for securing the vaccines.  'The swift procurement of these vaccines is a very positive step. While local transmission of Monkeypox has so far been limited, we can't rely on that to continue.   'The availability of MPX vaccine for people who need it is a critical forward defence against transmission. It will help people look after their own health as well as that of people they are intimate with.  'Gay and bisexual men are already taking Monkeypox very seriously, monitoring for symptoms and regularly seeking medical advice. This is a very welcome additional tool.'  Alexis Apostolellis, CEO of the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine said: 'Australia's clinical workforce has learned a lot over the past two months about how to detect, treat and prevent monkeypox, and vaccination is the critical next step.'  Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which people usually pick up in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. It is usually spread through direct contact with animals such as squirrels, which are known to harbour the virus. However, it can also be transmitted through very close contact with an infected person. Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa until now and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can prove fatal. However it can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit. Monkeypox shuts down some aspects of your body's ability to fight infections. Because of the presence of other viruses and bacteria which your body can't fight off, in the worst cases patients can succumb to a lethal shock throughout the body and blood poisoning. Death is more likely to occur in younger patients. The skin lesions are painful and disfiguring, and can be the source of further infections. Health chiefs have warned monkeypox, a virus endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions, could also spread to some pets and become endemic in Europe. Undated handout file image issued by the UK Health Security Agency of the stages of Monkeypox Because monkeypox is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, jabs for smallpox can also protect people from getting monkeypox. One vaccine, Imvanex, was shown to be around 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox infection. Antivirals and pooled blood from individuals vaccinated against smallpox can be used to treat severe cases. How does it spread? Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection by nature, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Contagious lesions, through which infections are most likely to be passed on, can appear on any part of the body. The infection can also be passed on through contact with clothing or linens used by an infected person. Until now, monkeypox had only ever been detected in four countries outside of Africa - the UK, US, Israel and Singapore. And all of those cases had travel links to Nigeria and Ghana. Most of the British and Spanish cases are gay or bisexual men, which officials say is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'. The sexuality of patients in other countries has not been disclosed. Health chiefs in the UK have issued a direct plea to men who have sex with men, telling them to come forward if they develop a rash on their face or genitals. Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the genitals, hands or feet. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.  ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11078995/Monkeypox-vaccines-available-Australia-week.html"},
{"title": "NYC plans to delay second doses of monkeypox vaccine because of jabs shortage as officials warn outbreak is 'probably' out of control", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:38, 18 July 2022 ", "text": "New York City  is set to delay rolling out second doses of the  monkeypox  vaccine because it has too few doses, health officials say amid warnings the U.S. outbreak is already out of control. The city's Department of Health warned Friday it would likely be unable to meet this deadline because it has received too few doses from the federal government. Guidance states patients should receive their second dose of the jab four weeks after the first to ensure best protection. New York — which is at the epicenter of the outbreak — has switched track to prioritize getting first doses to as many patients as possible. It is also releasing the 1,000 doses it initially held back for second shots. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears over a vaccine shortage telling  STAT News  that New York City was among those set to receive yet more deliveries. Dr Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said it was 'not recommended' to delay second doses. Dr Rochelle Walensky, who heads up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sought to calm fears saying more doses were scheduled to be delivered to New York City imminently. Dr Peter Marks, from the Food and Drug Administration, said it was not recommended to extend the dosing period America is currently rolling out the Jynneous vaccine, which is given as a two-dose course with the second shot administered four weeks after the first. But several countries — including the UK and Canada — have already expanded this bracket as they prioritize getting first doses into arms. The tweaking of dosing schedules has echoes of the Covid pandemic, where many countries — but not the U.S. — widened the gap between doses in order to reach more people faster. Previous 1 Next             Monkeypox may already be out of control in the United States, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner has warned. Speaking in a CBS interview Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb warned that the window for getting on top of the disease 'probably has closed'. He said the national tally — at 1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the actual number because of poor testing coverage. And that monkeypox had likely already spread outside of gay and bisexual men, but that this was yet to be detected. Monkeypox has now been spotted in almost every U.S. state — except Mississippi in the south, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, and in Maine and Vermont. Of the tally, eight cases have been spotted so far in women nationally, and none in children and adolescents. No studies have been carried out on how effective the Jynneous vaccine is with a longer gap between doses. But manufacturers point to trial results showing it is as effective as ACAM2000 — the other monkeypox vaccine — from two weeks after the first dose to show a longer dosing interval may be possible. Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, raised no concerns over extending the time between doses when asked by DailyMail.com. 'There's nothing magical about the dosing interval and individuals can be caught up when supply is more abundant,' he said. 'The priority is getting some level of immunity in those at highest risk for exposure.'  New York City launched its monkeypox vaccine roll out on June 23 for gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks. The first recipients will be eligible for their second jab in just three days time. Revealing the delay Friday, the city said: 'Given the rapid increase in cases, the Health Department has decided that providing first doses to offer protection to more at-risk New Yorkers is the best strategy until we receive adequate vaccine supply. 'In many instances, this means that individuals may not get a second dose by the 28-day interval between doses as indicated in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing label.' They added: 'Until there is sufficient supply in the city, all vaccine doses will be treated as first doses, and we will only begin scheduling second dose appointments once we have enough vaccine to do so. 'The Department will communicate to people who have received first doses about when second doses are available and how to receive them.' Monkeypox vaccines are in very high demand in New York City, with appointments for the 9,300 doses released Friday all booked within minutes. Washington D.C., the other rolling out the jabs, is also seeing appointments run out rapidly. Nationally, more than 1,800 cases have been detected across all but seven states — Alaska, Maine, Montana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In New York the 489 cases have all been detected among men, with 60 percent identifying as either gay or bisexual. But a top expert has warned that the tropical disease has likely already spilled over into other groups — but is yet to be detected. No fatalities from the disease have been recorded in the U.S. to date, but young men who make up the bulk of the patients are at very low risk. There are mounting concerns, however, over the risk of fatalities should the disease reach pregnant women and older adults — who are more at risk. 'The negligible fatality rate won't necessarily persist if the virus escapes its current network: mostly young, mostly healthy adult men,' Donall McNeil, a journalist who sounded the alarm on Covid, Zika and other virus outbreaks, wrote for  Common Sense . 'In Africa, children and pregnant women are the most likely to die from monkeypox,' he added. Dr Scott Gottlieb warned on Sunday that the virus had likely spread to other groups besides gay or bisexual men, but was yet to be detected Walensky told STAT in an interview that anyone getting the vaccines would need two doses to get the 'higher level of protection'. She said: 'We're not asking New York — or anybody — to hold back doses right now because... we're pretty confident that what's going to come in is going to be able to cover those second doses.' Marks also warned against delaying second doses of the vaccine. 'We do not recommend to go off the recommended schedule here,' he said during a press conference at the Department of Health and Human Services. 'A single dose of this vaccine will not provide the kind of protection over time that is necessary if people continue this risky behavior. 'So, the two-dose regimen is the best that we can do to make sure that we actually have people get the protection that the vaccine is intended to provide.' Monkeypox may already be out of control in the United States, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner has warned. Speaking in a CBS interview Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA, warned that the window for getting on top of the disease 'probably has closed'. He said the national tally — at 1,800 cases — was likely 'just a fraction' of the actual number because of poor testing coverage.

Monkeypox has now been spotted in almost every U.S. state — except Mississippi in the south, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, and in Maine and Vermont. Of the tally, eight cases have been spotted so far in women nationally, and none in children and adolescents. Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation', Gottlieb said: 'I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. If it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close.' On the current tally, he added: 'We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases because we had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested and by and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. 'So, we're looking there, we're finding cases there, but it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now.  'We're not picking them up because we are not looking there.' ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11024549/NYC-plans-delay-second-doses-monkeypox-vaccine.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox is mutating at 12 times the expected rate potentially making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus, experts warn", "author": "Mansur Shaheen U.S. Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 22:03, 27 June 2022 ", "text": "The  monkeypox  virus strain that has emerged across the world in recent weeks may be evolving at an abnormally fast rate - making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that the virus has replicated up to 12 times its expected pace since 2018. This means that the virus, which is generally believed to spread by physical touch, contaminated surfaces or very close bodily contact could be able to spread in ways atypical to the tropical viruses normal patterns. It would explain the recent global monkeypox update, where 201 cases have been detected across 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C., with over 3,500 cases detected worldwide in countries where the virus is not endemic. Researchers found that the current strain of the monkeypox virus that has caused worldwide outbreaks of the tropical virus is mutating at a speed 12 times what is expected of it. This potentially makes it more transmissible Researchers, whose findings are pending official publishing in nature, collected and studied 15 samples of the monkeypox virus for the study. The NIH team restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. While the virus was detected recently in human populations, experts believe this strain of West African monkeypox first began its movement through the world in 2018. How viruses mutate and circulate is a generally known science. DNA viruses like monkeypox generally do not rapidly mutate - like COVID-19 does. Previous 1 Next             The nature of the virus allows it to fix errors that emerge when it replicates, leaving much lower room for mutations to form - and in effect limiting the number of variants. When researchers did investigate this strain of the virus, they found that it had mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. Why exactly this is can not be determined, though the experts believe that this could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year. Cases of monkeypox have appeared in nearly 50 countries where it is not endemic in recent weeks.  While occasionally non-endemic nations will find cases - two were detected in the U.S. in 2021 - infections are usually easy to find and outbreaks can be controlled by health officials once they catch wind of circulation. This outbreak has been different, though, with cases quickly being detected in droves around the world. This could signal a more infectious version of the virus is afoot.  The 201 cases in the U.S. this year are believed to be a severe undercount as some experts have warned that the country does not have the necessary testing and tracking capabilities to stay on top of each new case. The version of monkeypox spreading around the world is of the West African variety, but it is mutating at a pace that would not be expected of a DNA virus (file photo) Some even fear that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., UK and other countries around the world. Most infections that have been spotted as part of the current outbreak are among gay and bisexual men, both in the U.S. and across Europe. California, America's most populous state, has recorded 51 infections thus far - the most of any state. New York and Illinois have also logged 35 and 26 respectively. With the way the virus has spread through sexual networks, some fear that Pride festivities across America last weekend could lead to a surge in cases. In preparation, New York City health officials began to rollout monkeypox vaccines to the city's population last week. Supply of the shots quickly ran thin, though, with walk-in appointments being cut off on Friday due to high demand. With the jab taking around four days to fully activate as well, there are questions over whether the shots came out too late to matter ahead of the city's Pride parade which hosted around two million people.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10958337/Experts-warn-monkeypox-mutating-12-times-expected-rate.html"},

Speaking in an interview with  CNN , Dr Ashwin Vasan, commissioner of NYC Health, warned the city's tally of 500-odd cases — the highest in America — was likely just a fraction of the total. He claimed the 'root cause' of the rapid spread of the illness was a failure by federal officials to roll out jabs against the disease quickly. New York City (NYC) and Washington D.C. are offering the jabs to gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners every two weeks in an attempt to put a lid on the outbreak. But their roll outs have been repeatedly blasted for not offering enough doses, with available appointments being fully booked minutes after they are opened. NYC is now delaying second doses — due four weeks after the first dose — because the priority is to roll out first jabs. The city says this is safe, but other experts have raised concerns as this has not previously been tested. Dr Ashwin Vasan, who heads up New York City's Department of Health, said the city was struggling to get a handle on monkeypox because it was getting too few jabs from the central Government Speaking about the monkeypox vaccine roll out, Vasan said it was proving 'challenging' with several technical issues. 'But the really root issue here has been access to vaccine supply,' he said, 'and that's a national issue'. 'We need to start seeing much more vaccine, and the rest of these things will smooth out as people can get access to the preventive therapies they want. Previous 1 Next             The director of the  CDC  insisted warnings that the  monkeypox  is out of control were 'misinformed and off base' on Monday despite cases in the U.S. quadrupling over two weeks. Dr Rochelle Walensky also claimed in a statement that it was still possible to 'significantly decrease' infections thanks to more testing — with about 10,000 swabs carried out a day — more vaccines, and more awareness. Walensky's comments came after Dr Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that the window to get a handle on the tropical disease had likely already closed. Firing a broadside at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he also accused the agency of repeating the same mistakes as when Covid first arrived.   'We really need much more vaccine. I know that our partners are working hard in Washington and elsewhere, but we need that as soon as possible.' NYC has received more than 40,000 doses of the Jynneous jab to date, which are all being administered as first doses. But demand remains high, with appointments being booked out within minutes after they are released. Nationwide, almost 200,000 jabs have been distributed to states so far. America has also placed orders for millions more doses — in a sign officials expect to use many more jabs.   Asked whether the current cases tally for NYC was accurate, Vasan said: 'I think we can definitively say it's not. 'And that's because only now are we seeing clinical testing starting to ramp up. 'I think we're going to see cases rise all across this country over the coming weeks as clinical testing increases.' On preventing the disease spreading, he added: 'I will say that abstinence as a message doesn't really work. We know this. 'It's not a good public health tool because it's really about giving people the information to make safe choices but understanding we need to meet them where they are with those choices and give them the information to tell them how monkeypox is transmitted.' New York City's vaccine roll-out was slammed when it began last month for being announced via Twitter, meaning the message got to those on the social media platform first. It offered walk-ins for the first 24 hours, before scrapping this amid high demand for the shots. The roll-out was also criticized after a technical glitch saw thousands book their vaccination appointment early. The Department of Health had said it would only release the vaccination slots after midday, but the appointments went live early on a separate link that had been used to book appointments during the first round of inoculations. Earlier this month the city also announced it was delaying second doses because it was not receiving enough jabs from the Federal Government. NYC also undertook contact tracing, although it appears to have failed to curb the rash-causing virus with many cases turning up not linked to other infections. America is rolling out the Jynneous vaccine to fight the virus, which is given as two doses about four weeks apart. It also has more than a million doses of the ACAM2000 vaccine available, but this is not being used because it is associated with serious side-effects.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11036647/NYC-health-chiefs-blame-Feds-monkeypox-cases-spiraling-city-blaming-lack-vaccine.html"},

Meanwhile, Dr Hopkins added that we will see at least one more Covid wave later this year partnered with an 'ongoing transmission of monkeypox'.  There are also mounting fears that the NHS will be struck down at the same time by Covid, with colder weather and darker evenings leading to increased social contact indoors — where viruses find it easier to spread.

Speaking on Thursday in a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr Hopkins said: 'We are planning for an influenza wave. I don't know if people re following Australia, but we are watching very, very carefully.  'It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave.

And, for the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox.'  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests 1.3million people in England were infected during the week to June 18, up by a fifth compared to the previous estimate. Yet the week-on-week rise is half of the 40 per cent spike logged in last week's projection. Cases are also on the rise in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Experts previously told MailOnline the figures suggest the current wave 'may be slowing' already and 'may not go that high after all'. They admitted, however, that the peak is still to come. Dr Hopkins said: 'For the next six months at least, we will have ongoing community transmission of monkeypox' The Omicron sub-strains BA.4 and BA.5 are now the dominant strains in the UK, the UK Health Security Agency today confirmed for the first time. They are thought to be even more infectious than their ancestral versions, which were to blame for cases reaching pandemic highs in December and April, but just as mild. Meanwhile, Monkeypox cases in the UK have risen above 1,000 as the rare disease continues to spread, officials confirmed today. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses said there had been 1,076 infections as of Sunday, almost double the number a fortnight ago.

The state leads the nation in confirmed cases, having recorded 1,247 of the 4,907 infections in America — with nearly all cases in and around  New York City . State health commissioner Dr Mary Bassett said the declaration would 'free up' extra funding to help prevent the disease's spread. It came the same day San Francisco officials said they would declare a 'local emergency' over monkeypox as its infection tally reached 241. No nationwide alert has been issued yet, although the Biden administration is considering the move. The above map shows the number of monkeypox cases declared across the U.S. by CDC The above graph shows the total number of cases of monkeypox confirmed in the United States. This week the tally shot up by more than 1,000 in 24 hours, which officials said was down to 'historic' cases finally being recorded Previous 1 Next             Every American should 'pay attention' to the monkeypox outbreak because the disease could spill over into more groups than just gay men, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned Thursday — before U.S. cases topped 4,900, the highest tally in the world. Dr Xavier Becerra, secretary of the HHS, issued the stark warning during a press briefing, adding that infections with the disease were 'painful' and could also be dangerous. He did insist it was 'absolutely' still possible for the U.S. to eliminate monkeypox. The vast majority of cases are still among gay or bisexual men, but last week America recorded its first two cases in children — in a toddler in California and infant traveling through Washington D.C. — and a pregnant woman who tested positive when she was near full-term. Top experts have been warning for weeks that other groups could catch the disease because it does not require sexual contact to transmit, but only close contact such as hugs or brushing the rashes of an infected person. Making the declaration Thursday, Bassett said: 'Based on the ongoing spread of this virus, which has increased rapidly and affected primarily [gay or bisexual male] communities... I've declared monkeypox an Imminent Threat to Public Health throughout New York State. 'This declaration means that local health departments... will be able to access additional State reimbursement, after other Federal State funding sources are maximized. '[This will held] protect all New Yorkers and ultimately limit the spread of monkeypox in our communities.' Concern has been growing over monkeypox after cases spiked by more than 1,000 in a day on Wednesday — with officials predicting they will keep rising for 'weeks'. About 99 percent of infections have been detected in men, with the 'vast majority' among those who are gay or bisexual. But top experts fear the disease will spill into more vulnerable groups. Over the last seven days America has recorded its first two cases in children — a toddler in California and infant in Washington D.C. — and one in a pregnant woman. In announcing plans to declare monkeypox an emergency this week, San Francisco's mayor London Breed said the 'early action' was needed to 'protect public health'. 'Many people in our LGBTQ+ community are scared and frustrated,' she said. 'This local emergency will allow us to continue to support our most at-risk, while also better preparing for what's to come.' Director of Health for the Bay Area city Dr Grant Colfax said the COVID-19 pandemic had taught them that early action was needed to contain the disease. Their declaration will go into effect on August 1. The Biden administration is also expected to declare monkeypox a health emergency in the coming days,  Politico  reports.  It would follow on from a similar decision made last week by the World Health Organization, after they previously shied away from the move. When this was declared, the White House said it was a 'call to action' for countries to begin 'stopping' the spread of the virus globally. Both cities have struggled to get hold of enough doses of the vaccine to protect citizens against the disease. New York City is offering the jab to all gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners in a fortnight, while San Francisco is rolling it out to 'everyone who wants it'. New York got another 110,000 doses yesterday with 80,000 earmarked for New York City, on top of the 60,000 rolled out statewide so far. But San Francisco was offered only 4,220 out of the 35,000 it had initially requested. Roll outs have previously been slammed for their slow pace, and how it's 'ridiculous' so few jabs are available in such large cities. America has the most confirmed monkeypox cases in the world. But when the data is considered per head - a more accurate measure because it takes into account countries differing population sizes - it shows Spain has the worst outbreak It comes after a survey warned concerns over monkeypox were growing among Americans amid spiraling cases. The Annenberg Public Policy Center, a part of the University of Pennsylvania, interviewed 1,500 Americans over whether they were concerned about catching Covid or monkeypox two weeks ago. It found 19 percent said they were worried about being infected with monkeypox. A greater proportion — 30 percent — said they still had concerns over catching Covid. The majority of people surveyed said they were not concerned about becoming infected with either disease. The center's director Kathleen Jamieson said: 'It's important that the public calibrate its concerns to the reality of the risk of Covid and monkeypox and act appropriately.' ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11061971/Monkeypox-declared-imminent-threat-public-health-New-York.html"},

WHO epidemiologist Dr Margaret Harris appeared on the breakfast show on Monday morning and was asked whether the declaration was an 'overreaction'. WHO epidemiologist Dr Margaret Harris appeared on The Today Show on Monday morning to discuss the recent declaration of monkeypox as a global public health emergency 'Doctor, I guess there's some concern because with the benefit of hindsight, now we remember those months in early 2020 when Covid was building around the world and the World Health Organisation didn't declare it an emergency,' co-host Charles Croucher said. 'Is this a reaction to, perhaps, being too slow on that front?' Dr Harris replied: 'Actually that's wrong. 'We also declared a public health emergency of international concern for Covid on January 30, 2020, but we did that early again because we didn't want it to become a pandemic. There are more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox worldwide and over 40 in Australia 'That's, again, why we declare these things early, to try to get the world together.' Dr Harris said the reason for declaring monkeypox a global emergency so early on was to raise awareness, and 'bring the international scientific community together' to work on combating the virus. Previous 1 Next             She added the WHO was concerned the virus would have disastrous impacts on those who were immunosuppressed. 'We want the world to take it seriously and take the actions we've recommended and we want those actions taken now,' she said. Dr Harris said the reason for declaring monkeypox (pictured) a global emergency so early on was to raise awareness, and 'bring the international scientific community together' to work on combating the virus Co-host Ally Langdon then asked if the the emergency declaration may be sparking fear in the community unnecessarily. Dr Harris said that was a factor taken into consideration when the decision was made.  'There is also concern that people would then stigmatise the populations in which the virus is transmitting very rapidly,' she said. 'And it is a hard one because you don't want people to say, \"Oh, you're overreacting\", or you don't want people to panic unnecessarily.' Monkeypox - often caught through handling monkeys - is a rare viral disease that kills around 10 per cent of people it strikes, according to figures. The virus responsible for the disease is found mainly in the tropical areas of west and central Africa. Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958, with the first reported human case in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970. Human cases were recorded for the first time in the US in 2003 and the UK in September 2018. It resides in wild animals but humans can catch it through direct contact with animals, such as handling monkeys, or eating inadequately cooked meat.  The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, or the eyes, nose or mouth. It can pass between humans via droplets in the air, and by touching the skin of an infected individual, or touching objects contaminated by them.  Symptoms usually appear within five and 21 days of infection. These include a fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and fatigue. The most obvious symptom is a rash, which usually appears on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. This then forms skin lesions that scab and fall off. Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can often prove fatal. There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox infection, according to the World Health Organization.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11044461/WHO-expert-SLAPS-Today-host-Covid-question-monkeypox-emergency-declaration.html"},

Kathy Hochul says she’s ‘sounding the alarm’ as Empire State hits 1,400 cases", "author": "Joseph Michalitsianos For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 01:33, 31 July 2022 ", "text": "New York governor Kathy Hochul announced late Friday that  monkeypox  is now a state disaster emergency as her administration struggles to disperse vaccines to contain the spread. The announcement comes as monkeypox cases rise in  New York City , the current US epicenter of the outbreak, where case counts passed 1,400 on Friday.  Hochul tweeted: 'I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our ongoing efforts to confront the monkeypox outbreak.  'This Executive Order enables us to respond more swiftly, and allows health care professionals to take additional steps that will help get more New Yorkers vaccinated.' Hochul continued: 'More than one in four monkeypox cases in this country are in New York, currently having a disproportionate impact on at-risk groups.  'We are working around the clock to secure more vaccines, expand testing capacity, and educate New Yorkers on how to stay safe.' Monkeypox is currently hitting gay men the hardest, with an estimated 95 per cent of US infections occurring among them. New York City is home to one of the United States largest LGBT communities, and is in line to receive 110,000 doses of the federal governments 800,000 upcoming monkeypox vaccines - but Hochul still wants more.  New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared the monkeypox disease an emergency in her state, making New York the first state to do so New York City Mayor Eric Adams also declared a public health emergency, as he moves to 'expand outreach and access to vaccines and treatment to keep people safe.'  'New York City is currently the epicenter of the outbreak, and we estimate that approximately 150,000 New Yorkers may currently be at risk for monkeypox exposure,' he continued in the statement.   Hochul echoed the fear and told reporters Saturday 'what we’re seeing are signs where it could escalate dramatically.' 'When I’m making the case to the federal government that we need more doses, more than we’ve been previously allocated, I can demonstrate there is high demand and need,' Hochul continued  The announcements are mostly made to trigger emergency administrative functions, such as increasing the pool of people eligible to administer vaccines.  It also allows physicians and nurses practitioners to give out the shout, and also makes sure vaccine providers send data to the state government.  Previous 1 Next             New York is anticipating 110,000 vaccines from the federal government, of which 80,000 will go to New York City. Hochul emphasized there is an acute danger 'particularly in the gay male population,' but said 'we’re going to protect them. We’re not going to sweep this under the rug.'  No deaths have been registered in the country to date but several patients have been hospitalized.    The United States has become the global epicenter of the  monkeypox  outbreak, overtaking  Spain  following a record-breaking 24 hours in which 1,048 new cases were confirmed. The updated data for Wednesday shows that there are now 4,639 confirmed cases in the U.S. Spain currently has 3,738. Previous 1 Next             Spain has the most per capita cases of monkeypox, while the U.S. has the greatest total number The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on Wednesday that the uptick in cases was likely due to an increase in testing, after it expanded capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 swabs per week. By population — which takes into account the U.S. having seven-times more people than Spain — America has about one case per 100,000 people.    In the U.S. cases were initially mostly linked to international travel, particularly to Europe, but many are now being detected in people who became infected in the country. Experts suggest the virus may have been transmitting for a while before it was detected. Hotspots New York City and Washington D.C. are rolling out vaccines against the virus to gay or bisexual men with multiple partners in two weeks to put a lid on the virus, but these programs have hit a brick wall with too few doses being supplied by the Federal Government. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11065639/New-York-state-declare-monkeypox-outbreak-DISASTER-EMERGENCY.html"},
{"title": "Monkeypox could become a 'permanently entrenched' STI in the US because early symptoms are 'easy to miss', Cornell expert warns - as cases jump to 244", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:08, 28 June 2022 ", "text": "Monkeypox  may become a 'permanently entrenched' sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the US because its early symptoms are easy to miss, an expert has warned. Dr Jay Varma, an epidemiologist at the Weill Cornell Medical School in  New York City , said early infection signs are 'innocuous' and in hard to see places — like the inside of the anus — raising the likelihood it is missed. This gives the rash-causing virus a window in which to transmit to others, before more serious signs like flu-like symptoms and rashes across the body appear.  Varma added that the tropical disease was also being aided by a lack of STI testing in the US, leaving many cases un-diagnosed. America has recorded 244 monkeypox cases to date, with another 43 spotted this weekend across 25 states and Washington D.C. But experts fear this could be just the 'tip of the iceberg', with many more infections in the community going undetected. This weekend the World Health Organization said it would not declare an international emergency over the emergence of the tropical disease. The above map shows where cases of monkeypox have been detected in America. On the right, the third column of the table shows the number of cases recorded over the last two days Previous 1 Next             Writing in the  New York Times , Varma said: 'Other experts and I fear that monkeypox will exploit this vulnerability [of a lack of testing] and become a permanently entrenched STI in the United States. Dr Jay Varma, an epidemiologist from Weill Cornell Medical School in New York City 'Initial skin changes in this outbreak often appear innocuous and can occur in locations that are easy to miss, such as inside the anus.  'Nevertheless, these lesions are highly contagious and can even contaminate surfaces or materials such as towels, which can spread infection to other people.  'The skin changes can also mimic those of other infections, such as herpes, molluscum or syphilis, so monkeypox can be easily misdiagnosed by someone not expert in evaluating STIs.' The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response. The committee said the outbreak should be 'closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks'.  But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread. The rash-causing virus was mostly being passed on through skin-to-skin contact during sex, many officials believe. He added: 'While there is some debate among epidemiologists about whether to call monkeypox 'sexually transmitted' versus 'sexually transmissible,' it is reasonable to consider that sex is one activity that transmits infection, similar to other infections that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact during sex, like herpes, syphilis and the human papillomavirus.' Varma compares the situation to that of HIV — which entered America in the 1970s and 80s — and syphilis — which is thought to have arrived with the first settlers in the 1500s. Cases of common STIs — including chlamydia and gonorrhea — are already thought to be at an all-time high nationwide. Experts say this is in part because of interruptions to testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to too few people are getting swabbed. It is likely that many cases of monkeypox are also going undiagnosed due to a lack of testing, or being written off as another infection. Last weekend America recorded its biggest two-day rise in monkeypox infections since the outbreak was detected last month. The rash-causing virus is likely spreading under the radar as well.  Several cases now not linked to a previously known infection or international travel, and experts have warned that poor surveillance methods are leaving populations vulnerable.  Nationwide, California has the biggest outbreak, with 67 cases, followed by New York with 37 and Florida and Illinois with 27 each. Globally cases now top more than 4,000 across about 60 countries, but only one death has been recorded to date in an individual from Nigeria. Cases are mostly being detected among men who have sex with men at present. But there are fears it will spill over into other groups that are more at risk from the disease, such as the immunocompromised. The disease is primarily passed on through skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions.   Officials are urging gay and bisexual men to be aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic It comes after the WHO did not declare a global health emergency over the monkeypox outbreak this weekend. In a statement Saturday, its emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years. 'While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute' a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement. WHO nevertheless pointed to the 'emergency nature' of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an 'intense' response.

The  monkeypox  virus strain that has emerged across the world in recent weeks may be evolving at an abnormally fast rate - making it more infectious than previous versions of the virus. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that the virus has replicated up to 12 times its expected pace since 2018. This means that the virus, which is generally believed to spread by physical touch, contaminated surfaces or very close bodily contact could be able to spread in ways atypical to the tropical viruses normal patterns. It would explain the recent global monkeypox update, where 201 cases have been detected across 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C., with over 3,500 cases detected worldwide in countries where the virus is not endemic. The version of monkeypox spreading around the world is of the West African variety, but it is mutating at a pace that would not be expected of a DNA virus (file photo) Researchers, whose findings are pending official publishing in nature, collected and studied 15 samples of the monkeypox virus for the study. The NIH team restructured the viruses genetic information to find the number of changes the virus had undergone since this strain began its circulation. While the virus was detected recently in human populations, experts believe this strain of West African monkeypox first began its movement through the world in 2018. How viruses mutate and circulate is a generally known science. DNA viruses like monkeypox generally do not rapidly mutate - like COVID-19 does. Previous 1 Next             The nature of the virus allows it to fix errors that emerge when it replicates, leaving much lower room for mutations to form - and in effect limiting the number of variants. When researchers did investigate this strain of the virus, they found that it had mutated between six to 12 times the generally believed rate for the virus. Why exactly this is can not be determined, though the experts believe that this could be playing a role in how the virus has managed to storm the world this year. Cases of monkeypox have appeared in nearly 50 countries where it is not endemic in recent weeks.  While occasionally non-endemic nations will find cases - two were detected in the U.S. in 2021 - infections are usually easy to find and outbreaks can be controlled by health officials once they catch wind of circulation. This outbreak has been different, though, with cases quickly being detected in droves around the world. This could signal a more infectious version of the virus is afoot.  The 201 cases in the U.S. this year are believed to be a severe undercount as some experts have warned that the country does not have the necessary testing and tracking capabilities to stay on top of each new case. Some even fear that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., UK and other countries around the world. Most infections that have been spotted as part of the current outbreak are among gay and bisexual men, both in the U.S. and across Europe. California, America's most populous state, has recorded 51 infections thus far - the most of any state. New York and Illinois have also logged 35 and 26 respectively. With the way the virus has spread through sexual networks, some fear that Pride festivities across America last weekend could lead to a surge in cases. In preparation, New York City health officials began to rollout monkeypox vaccines to the city's population last week. Supply of the shots quickly ran thin, though, with walk-in appointments being cut off on Friday due to high demand. With the jab taking around four days to fully activate as well, there are questions over whether the shots came out too late to matter ahead of the city's Pride parade which hosted around two million people.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10961047/Monkeypox-permanently-entrenched-STI-Cornell-expert-warns.html"},
{"title": "US monkeypox cases rise by record 63 in a DAY - bringing total infections to 306 - after Joe Biden revealed plan to roll out tens of thousands of vaccines", "author": "Luke Andrews Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "date": " 15:48, 29 June 2022 ", "text": "America's  monkeypox  cases have surged by a record 63 in just one day after the Biden administration unveiled plans to roll out tens of thousands of vaccines against the tropical disease. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) revealed the sharp rise on Tuesday — up 260 percent on 28 from the previous week — which took the nation's cumulative tally to 306 infections. New York — the national hotspot — saw the sharpest rise in patients with the rash-causing virus up 26 in a day, followed by  Illinois  where they rose by 18. The surge is unlikely to have been caused by the weekend's Pride celebrations because it takes more than a week for infected people to show symptoms and then get a test. Previous Pride month events may have played a role, though. The jump could be a result of increased surveillance, though. Last week the CDC ramped up monkeypox testing by sending thousands of kits to commercial laboratories around the U.S. It comes after the Biden administration revealed it has made 56,000 doses of the Jynneous vaccine — which can work against monkeypox — available to states. It will be releasing another 240,000 jabs in the coming weeks. The vaccines are ear-marked for monkeypox patients, their close contacts, and gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over a fortnight or visited a venue such as a club where a case of the tropical disease was later detected. But critics say there are not enough doses, and have slammed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for taking 'too long' to inspect a factory in Denmark where the U.S. has a million vaccines waiting in limbo. The jabs can only come to the country once the factory is approved by the FDA. The map above shows where monkeypox cases have been spotted in the US, and the numbers being recorded in each state over the previous 24 hours Lines form at a New York monkeypox vaccine clinic last week, which quickly ran out of the 1,000 Jynneos doses that were offered to men at high risk Yesterday's record case rise over takes the previous record set on Monday when 43 infections were reported. But this figure included cases detected late Friday, Saturday and on Sunday. The growing infection tally suggests that the rash-causing virus is increasingly spreading undetected in the United States. Previous 1 Next             The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency. In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were 'unusual' and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years.

New York City and Washington D.C. are the only two areas to start vaccinating the most at risk groups against monkeypox to date. But both ran out of slots for the vaccines within hours of opening their clinics amid surging demand. In New York officials had just 1,000 doses. Minnesota and Nebraska both recorded their first cases of monkeypox today.  The Biden administration's plans to roll out more Jynneous jabs were revealed just hours after advocates sent a  letter  to the  White House  slamming the administration's monkeypox response, saying that one million doses of the Jynneos vaccine already owned by the US are stuck in limbo in Denmark awaiting a facility inspection.  Although the vaccine itself has been approved for use by US regulators, the doses in Denmark were produced on a manufacturing line that is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval, officials said earlier this month.   The letter from PrEP4ALL and Partners for Health said in part: 'We must not allow the same failures of vaccine production and distribution that hampered the global COVID-19 response cause us to fail to contain the current monkeypox outbreak.' 'If this is a test run for pandemic preparedness, we are flunking,' PrEP4ALL co-founder James Krellenstein told the  Washington Post . 'We have more than a million doses of a vaccine FDA approved for preventing monkeypox,' he said. 'And the U.S. government cannot figure out how to get it out of freezers in Denmark — doses that it owns — when there's uncontained spread in the gay community.'  The Biden administration's new plan will immediately allocate 56,000 doses of Jynneos from a national stockpile to states and territories, with 1.6 million doses made available by the end of the year, officials said.  State and local health departments can also order supplies of Emergent BioSolutions' older ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply but which has more side effects and cannot be used by everyone, including those who are immunocompromised.  The United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000 in its stockpiles, officials said earlier this month, but the vaccine is not recommended for those with HIV.  The United States has officially recorded 306 cases of monkeypox, a viral infection related to smallpox that causes painful skin lesions -- but health officials fear that the true count could be higher.  Although the virus is endemic in parts of Africa, the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern that it could become more widespread.  Workers sit outside of D.C. Health's first monkeypox vaccination clinic, which is administering the first Jynneos vaccine doses distributed in the U.S. capital on Tuesday Even after Tuesday's announcement, some advocates expressed concerns that vaccines would not get to those who need them the most, including men who have sex with other men, a group at higher risk. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told the Post   that the latest announcement was a 'confusing mess' that did not explain the formula for distributing vaccines. 'There are profound questions of how they will allocate limited vaccines to which jurisdictions, and states and local communities need a coordinated federal plan,' Harvey told the outlet.  'We need to reach people who are at risk for monkeypox and conduct widespread vaccine efforts for gay people and other men who have sex with men.' The White House said in a statement that the vaccine doses will be distributed to 'areas with the highest transmission and need, using a tiered allocation system.' 'As additional supply becomes available, we will further expand our efforts, making vaccines available to a wider population,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters. Those at highest risk for monkeypox have been men who have sex with men. Demand for the vaccine has been growing. Last week, a New York clinic started offering the vaccine and quickly ran out of available shots. Previously, health officials have been focused on offering the vaccine to individuals with direct contact with a person who has had a confirmed case of monkeypox.  Last Thursday, New York City's health department - armed with 1,000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government - announced it was opening a temporary clinic  The new strategy will expand that definition to include presumed exposures, said Dr Jennifer McQuiston, Deputy Director of CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. These would include those who had close contact with someone diagnosed with the virus, those who know their sexual partner was infected, and gay men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where it is spreading. 'It's almost like we're expanding the definition of who a contact might be,' said McQuiston. If people have been to a party or other place where monkeypox has been known to spread 'we recommend they come in for a vaccine,' she said.  The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease, administration officials said. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.  There have been no U.S. deaths and officials say the risk to the American public is low. But they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem. One of the steps was to expand who is recommended to get vaccinated. Vaccines customarily are given to build immunity in people before they are ever infected.  But if given within days or even a few weeks of first becoming infected, some vaccines can reduce severity of symptoms. A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, is approved for monkeypox in the U.S. The government has many more doses of an older smallpox vaccine - ACAM2000 - that they say could also be used, but that vaccine is considered to have a greater risk of side effects and is not recommended for people who have HIV. ", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10965149/Monkeypox-cases-surge-record-63-just-ONE-day-taking-Americas-tally-306.html"},

'The immunization schedule must be two doses with an interval of 30 days between them,' Health Ministry Secretary Arnaldo Medeiro said. 'We are already in negotiations with the manufacturers to acquire the immunizers. The (emergency operation center) will monitor the entire pandemic process in relation to monkeypox.' WHO declared monkeypox a 'global health emergency' on July 23. The above graph shows the total number of cases of monkeypox confirmed in the United States.

Some people tend to recover within two to four weeks, according to the WHO. Anyone can spread monkeypox, but the current outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated almost exclusively among men who have sexual intercourse with men. The virus spreads primarily via intimate skin-to-skin contact, usually with someone who has an active rash, as well as via contact with contaminated clothes or bedding. It is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the COVID-19 pandemic. 'COVID is spread by respiratory route and is highly infectious. This doesn't appear to be the case with the monkeypox,' said Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11062475/Man-41-person-die-monkeypox-virus-Brazil.html"},

Officials in the Big Apple revealed the first snapshot of the demographics of people that have been infected with the tropical virus. Of the 336 cases in the city - the most of any singular locality in America - 321 are among men, with no confirmed cases among women. The remaining five percent of cases are split between  transgender  persons and cases where the gender is unknown.  Transgender people were not included with the LGBQ community in the data.  The virus has famously erupted among communities of gay and bisexual men across the world in recent months after first being detected in Europe, and this data confirms that the community is being hammered by the virus in New York as well. In total, over 11,000 cases have been detected in nations where the virus is not endemic as part of this outbreak - including 1,470 in the U.S. Previous 1 Next             According to  data  from NYC Health, every single person with a confirmed infection in the city is between the ages of 20 and 69, with a median age of 35. The virus has overwhelmingly hurt males in the city. Nearly every case has been confirmed in a male - which would make sense considering the sexual networks where the virus has so far traveled. While no cases have been confirmed among women yet, there are still eight cases where the gender of the person was not recorded. Straight people have largely avoided the virus as well, with only two confirmed cases among the group. Around 60 percent of confirmed cases are in the LGBQ community. Transgender individuals were not included with this group. The sexuality of the infected person was unknown in 40 percent of cases. Monkeypox has spread across racial groups, though. Around one-in-three cases are among white people, with one-in-five found in the Hispanic community. These figures are likely significant undercounts, though, as officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been panned for failing to control the virus. Monkeypox has been allowed to spread undetected because of failures in America's testing and surveillance infrastructure - similar to how Covid was allowed to spread so widely early on when it caught the world off guard in early 2020. Unlike Covid, though, monkeypox is not novel, leaving experts frustrated with how top officials failed to deal with a threat they were already knowledgeable to.  'Why is it so hard for something that's even a known pathogen?' Dr Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA said to the New York Times. 'How many more times do we have to go through this?' America's monkeypox response has been marred by a fractured and limited testing system and limited access to vaccines that could help Americans get ahead of infection. Dozens of people lined up for vaccines against monkeypox in New York City Friday as the city launched its second jabbing drive. The queue — formed mostly of men — snaked around the side of the Chelsea sexual health clinic in Manhattan this morning. Gay or bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners over two weeks are again being offered the jab in America's monkeypox capital, alongside anyone exposed to a patient with the tropical disease. But the 2,500 appointments available for the jabs ran out within minutes yesterday, as thousands hurried to grab a slot. Health officials were slammed for a 'technical glitch' which allowed so many people to book slots early using an old link that by the time the first batch was released it was already full, leaving frustrated New Yorkers saying they were left with 'zero chance' of getting a jab. At a press briefing last week the city's health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan said the locations had been chosen because three-quarters of cases were in Manhattan.  This included about a third in the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods specifically. The Health Department is primarily using Twitter to tell people when jabs are available, leaving those who are not regularly on the application in the lurch. On Wednesday it revealed another 6,000 doses had arrived from the federal Government. At first, when a person was feeling symptoms of the virus they would be tested locally for the orthopox family of viruses. If positive, their sample would need to be sent to the CDC for confirmation - a process that could take days. This meant that even working as fast as possible, case figures in the U.S. were always going to be days behind. Some of those testing gaps have since been filled, with the CDC announcing in recent days that both Labcorp and the Mayo Clinic had been enlisted in expanding testing capacity. Still, though, access to monkeypox testing is extremely limited and sparse in a nation of over 330 million people. 'It's pretty clear that we need to rapidly scale up the ability to diagnose this now,' said Dr Jay Varma, a Cornell University public health expert who advised the New York City's mayor's office during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some experts are comparing this shortage of testing to where America was early on in the Covid pandemic. One significant difference is that the scientific community had no idea what Covid was when it fist emerged, and how to diagnose it was still unclear. With a virus like monkeypox, which is endemic in some parts of the world and occasionally pops up in the United States, experts believe the same mistakes should not have been repeated again. 'We clearly identified this as a major mistake that allowed Covid to get its footprint in the U.S. and spread undetected for a month, without any of us knowing... and now we're just doing the same thing all over again, because that's the way it's done,' Dr Angela Rasmussen, a public health expert at Canada's University of Saskatchewan told the Times. The rolling out of vaccines has been spotty as well. American officials are believed to have around 800,000 doses of the two-shot Jynneos vaccine - a figure that may not be nearly enough. When vaccines have become available, supply has not been able to meet demand. In New York City - the nation's virus hotspot - walk-in events to receive the jabs often reach maximum demand within minutes of opening. These failures to properly track and prevent spread of the virus has many experts fearing that the virus will become endemic in the U.S., as it has in parts of West and Central Africa.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11018731/NYC-reveals-95-monkeypox-patients-Big-Apple-men.html"}
